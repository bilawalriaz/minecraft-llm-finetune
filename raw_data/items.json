    "content": "Item Entity Health 5 [1] Behavior Does not exist Details Size Height: 0.25 Blocks Width: 0.25 Blocks Items are \"dropped\" blocks or items (non-block resources) that appear in the world, rather than being in the inventory of a player or block entity; they are a type of entity.\n\n3D dropped items, both blocks and strict items.\n\nItems have two possible appearances, generally corresponding to whether the item appears as a 3D or 2D shape in a player's inventory screens.\n\n3D items appear as their 3D shape, miniaturized to about 1 \u2044 4 scale, while 2D items appear as 1 \u2044 2 scale with all the pixels extruded into a cube.\n\nBoth types slowly rotate and bob up and down; this is merely a visual effect, the item itself does not actually rotate or bob up and down.\n\nItem entities that represent a stack of more than one item appear as several items stuck together.\n\nStacks of 1 appear as one item, 2-16 as two items, 17\u201332 as three, 33-48 as four, and 49+ as five.\n\nThe rotation rate of the item is approximately 2.87675 degrees per tick, or 57.595 degrees per second.\n\nItem entities come from many sources.\n\nSome common ones are: The death of a mob or player.\n\nA block that is mined by a player, destroyed by an explosion, or washed away by water.\n\nAn inventory item tossed by pressing the drop item key (default Q on PC, on Xbox, / on Nintendo Switch, on PlayStation) or dragging a stack outside of an inventory window.\n\nIn the mobile versions of Bedrock Edition, items in the hotbar can be dropped by pressing on the item's slot.\n\nThe entire stack is dropped.\n\nA container (other than an ender chest or a shulker box) that is destroyed while holding items inside.\n\nThe player may be thought of as having an \"item pickup\" box that surrounds their hitbox.\n\nThis pickup box extends 1 additional block to the horizontal sides, and 0.5 additional blocks up and down.\n\nAny item whose hitbox intersects with the pickup box can be picked up.\n\nThe pickup box is inclusive on the horizontal sides (distance less than or equal to 1 will count), and exclusive on the vertical sides (distance less than 0.5 will count, but not equal).\n\nWhen the player's hitbox size changes, such as when crouching [Java Edition only ] or sleeping, the pickup box size changes with it.\n\nOnce an item entity's hitbox overlaps with the player's pickup box, it can transfer its items.\n\nAs many items as can fit in the player inventory, excluding the armor slots and the off-hand slot, are transferred.\n\nIf any item is transferred, a \"plopping\" sound is played.\n\nIf all items are transferred, the items appear to move into the center of the player.\n\nThe item entity never physically moves, however, which means it can appear to go through lava and blocks in its path.\n\nThis can happen through blocks that are thinner than a full block, but also through the shared edge of two full blocks.\n\nUnlike experience orbs, multiple item entities can be picked up simultaneously.\n\nDropped items have a delay of 10 ticks (half a second) between appearing and being able to be picked up, or 40 ticks (2 seconds) if thrown by a player, dolphin, or fox.\n\nWhen two stackable items of the same type come within 3/4 of a block of each other, they merge into a single stack if the resulting stack size does not exceed that item's maximum stack size.\n\nItems do not collide with other entities(except boats) and are only moved or stopped by blocks.\n\nLike other entities, items can be pushed by flowing water and bubble columns, pushed by a piston, launched by a moving slime block, stuck to a honey block, or caught in a cobweb.\n\nItems move at faster speeds if ice is placed under the flowing water.\n\nWhen in still water, items float slowly up to the surface.\n\nItems can be reared by fishing rods, costing 3 durability. [Java Edition only ] If an item is within a solid block, then it flies out one of the unobstructed sides, or out of the top of the block if surrounded by solid blocks on all sides.\n\nIt does this even if the space below is unoccupied; therefore, it is possible to recover an item dropped by breaking a hole in a floor by quickly placing another block there.\n\nItems visually disappear when the player is about 16 blocks away from them, and reappear when they get closer.\n\nThis distance can be adjusted by the \"Entity Distance\" slider in video settings.\n\nUnlike most entities, items cannot be spectated in Spectator mode without use of the / spectate command.\n\nItems cannot be attacked by players or mobs; attempting to do so simply hits through them.\n\nHowever, they take damage and disappear from environmental or block-based damage such as explosions, fire, lava, and contact with cacti.\n\nItems have essentially no health, so they are destroyed by the slightest damage, though if set on fire they may remain for a few seconds before disappearing.\n\nNether stars are immune to explosions, and netherite -based items and tools are immune to fire and float on top of lava.\n\nAlso, some blocks that normally damage mobs, such as magma blocks, campfires, sweet berry bushes, wither roses and powder snow, do not damage items.\n\nItems despawn after 6000 game ticks (5 minutes) of being in a loaded, entity-ticking chunk; this is affected by the player's simulation distance.\n\nIf two item stacks merge, the timer is set to the item that has more time remaining.\n\nThe 5-minute timer is paused when the chunk is unloaded or no longer processing entities.\n\nNether stars do not despawn [Bedrock Edition only ].\n\nItems that fall into the void immediately despawn when they fall below Y=-128 in the Overworld, or Y=-64 in the Nether and the End.\n\nJava Edition: Item Entities use the Ambient/Environment sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 0.6-3.4 for using / give and items from advancement rewards Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: See also: Chunk format Dropped items have entity data associated with them that contain various properties of the entity.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Age: The number of ticks the item has been \"untouched\".\n\nAfter 6000 ticks (5 minutes) the item is destroyed.\n\nIf set to -32768, the Age does not increase, preventing the item from despawning automatically.\n\nHealth: The health of the item, which starts at 5.\n\nItems take damage from fire, lava, cacti and explosions.\n\nThe item is destroyed when its health reaches 0.\n\nItem: The inventory item, without the Slot tag.\n\nTags common to all items Owner: If present, only the player with this UUID can pick up the item.\n\nUsed by the give command (and can be set in a summon command) to prevent the wrong player from picking up the spawned item entity.\n\nPickupDelay: The number of ticks the item cannot be picked up.\n\nDecreases by 1 per tick.\n\nIf set to 32767, the PickupDelay does not decrease, preventing the item from being picked up.\n\nThrower: The UUID of the player who dropped the item.\n\nNot present if the item was not dropped by a player.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nMC-4, the oldest standing bug in the Minecraft bug tracker, involves item entity positioning being incorrectly handled.\n\nFirst image of 3D dropped items.\n\nItems despawning after being rendered for 5 minutes.\n\nDrops \u2014 items dropped by mobs when killed.\n\nChunk format for more information about the attributes of items.\n\n\u2191 Items cannot be damaged by attacking them.\n\n\u2191 MC-36538 \u2191 a b https://youtu.be/YIm_AKUbqh8 Early video of Minecraft (Classic 0.24) by Notch referring to item entities as \"resources\" \u2191 MC-15 \u2191 \"Diamonds are a miners best friend.\n\nIt's only fair they get treated to some luxury rendering.\n\nhttp://dinnerbone.com/media/uploads/2012-12/screenshots/Minecraft_2012-12-11_12-13-11.png \u2026 #AndMaybeEverythingElseToo\" \u2013 @Dinnerbone (Nathan Adams) on X, December 11, 2012 \u2191 \"@PaymenowTV It's Fancy Rendering option, but really won't make much of a difference on even a slow pc.\" \u2013 @Dinnerbone (Nathan Adams) on X, December 11, 2012 \u2191 https://youtu.be/tMOZLAxPWFE \u2191 MC-120158 \u2014 \"Anvils and other falling_blocks with HurtEntities set to true kill items and xp orbs\" \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\nEntities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ] Items View at: Template:Items/content [edit ]",

    "content": "This article needs to be updated.\n\nPlease update this page to reflect recent updates or newly available information.\n\nReason: Include information about armor trims.\n\nFor the armor that can be worn by adult horses, see Horse Armor.\n\nFor wolves, see Wolf Armor.\n\nFor the feature in Minecraft Dungeons, see MCD:Armor.\n\nFor armor trims, see Smithing Template.\n\n\"Chainmail\" redirects here.\n\nFor the armor material, see Armor materials.\n\nArmor Rarity Common Renewable Netherite: No All others: Yes Stackable No Armor tiers.\n\nFrom left (weakest) to right (strongest): no armor, leather, golden, chainmail, iron, diamond and netherite.\n\n(Note that the turtle shell is not pictured.\n\nThe turtle shell is between iron and diamond, having equal armor points and greater durability than iron.) Armor is a category of items that provide players and certain mobs with varying levels of protection from common damage types, and appear graphically on the wearer (excluding non-humanoid wearers).\n\nThese items include several different tiers of helmets, chestplates, leggings, and boots, which can each be placed in designated armor slots of a player's inventory for use.\n\nA full set of armor consists of 24 units of a given material.\n\nA turtle shell is a helmet with no corresponding armor pieces.\n\nDespite there being chain items, chainmail armor cannot be crafted.\n\nA full suit of Netherite armor needs 4 units of smithing templates and 4 units of Netherite ingots (16 netherite scraps and 16 gold ingots); obtaining netherite armor requires combining a diamond armor piece with a netherite ingot and smithing template using a smithing table.\n\nArmor can be repaired by placing two pieces of the same type (e.g., iron helmets) in a grindstone or in the crafting grid.\n\nThe resulting item has 5% more durability left than the original items combined, if the total durability of both of the armor pieces is more than the total durability that a piece of armor would have fresh from a crafting table, but any enchantments are lost.\n\nRepairing armor with an anvil preserves and combines the enchantments, with a rising experience cost for subsequent repairs on the same item.\n\nA piece of armor can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the armor material 's repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% of the armor item's maximum durability, rounded down.\n\nChainmail armor can be repaired in an anvil using iron ingots.\n\nNetherite armor can be repaired in an anvil using netherite Ingots.\n\nZombies, skeletons and their variants that spawn with armor have a small chance of dropping their armor when killed by the player.\n\nWhen killed, the armor they drop can vary from 0 to full durability.\n\nUpon death, zombies, zombie villagers, skeletons, zombified piglins, and wither skeletons always drop any armor that they picked up and equipped.\n\nThey may also be wearing enchanted armor that retains the enchantment when dropped.\n\nRarely, a mob can drop a chainmail armor item.\n\nThis is the only other way to obtain chainmail armor besides finding it in buried treasure or trading with villagers.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, pillagers and vindicators that spawn in raids have a small chance to drop an iron helmet, iron chestplate, iron leggings or iron boots, in a badly damaged state, with a possibility of having a random enchantment.\n\nIn Java Edition, armorer villagers throw chainmail armor to players who have the Hero of the Village status effect.\n\nTwo armor stands are found in each taiga village outdoor armory, one equipped with an iron helmet, the other with an iron chestplate.\n\nLeather armor can be bought from leatherworker villagers.\n\nThese armor pieces have randomly determined color.\n\nIron armor, chainmail armor and enchanted diamond armor can be bought from armorer villagers.\n\nPiglins may barter iron boots enchanted with Soul Speed when given a gold ingot.\n\nLeather boots, often badly damaged, can be obtained as a junk item from fishing.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a sealed room in woodland mansions can appear that has a chest always containing an Efficiency I leather cap or Efficiency I leather tunic or Efficiency I leather pants.\n\n[1] Helmets \u2191 a b c d e f All enchantments are equally probable, including treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak),

increases: each 2 done by the attack reduces the effective defense points by 1 (), but not below 20% of the armor points.\n\nIn short, the stronger the attack force, the less the armor points protect the player.\n\nMinimum: the lowest percentage that the full set protects from a strong attack.\n\nEach point just protects 0.8%.\n\nMaximum: the highest percentage each tier protects.\n\nProtection: the fourth level adds 16 percent of protection to the final calculation.\n\nIncreased toughness means less armor defense point reduction from strong attacks.\n\nMore information on this can be seen in \u00a7 Mechanics below.\n\nTo have any protective effect, armor must be worn by the player.\n\nA helmet, chestplate, leggings, and boots are equipped by placing them in the head, chest, legs and feet slots of the inventory next to the player 's character, respectively.\n\nArmor can also be equipped by right clicking while held.\n\nIf the respective slot already contains a piece of armor, they are swapped, and the original armor ends up in the player's hand.\n\nA chestplate provides the most protection per unit of material, followed by leggings.\n\nFor leather, iron, and diamond armor, boots have equivalent armor points as the helmet, but for chainmail and gold armor, the helmet trumps boots.\n\nA turtle shell, in addition to providing protection, also gives the player the Water Breathing status effect.\n\nEach armor piece consumes one inventory slot.\n\nThey cannot be stacked.\n\nIf wearing any piece of gold armor, Piglins become neutral towards the player, however Piglin Brutes remain hostile.\n\nIf wearing any piece of leather armor, a player is immune to freezing damage and FOV change.\n\nIf wearing leather boots, players may walk on powder snow.\n\nThis grants the \"Light as a Rabbit\" achievement.\n\nMain article: Armor materials There are seven different types of materials of armor, including turtle shells.\n\nThe six full sets are shown below in order from weakest (offers the least protection and is the least durable) to strongest (offers the most protection and is the most durable).\n\nLeather (on Steve) Golden (on Steve) Chainmail (on Steve) Iron (on Steve) Diamond (on Steve) Netherite (on Steve) Leather (on Alex) Golden (on Alex) Chainmail (on Alex) Iron (on Alex) Diamond (on Alex) Netherite (on Alex) The Turtle Shell is not part of a full set.\n\nHowever, its defense points match gold, chainmail, and iron helmets, while its durability is between iron and diamond helmets (276).\n\nIn the game's code, its protection is equivalent to iron armor.\n\nCertain items provide beneficial effects when worn, but provide no protection against damage.\n\nA carved pumpkin can be worn in the helmet slot.\n\nIt partially blocks the player's vision, but prevents endermen from becoming aggressive when the player looks at them.\n\nMob heads can be worn in the helmet slot.\n\nThey cut a player's detection range by 50% for the corresponding mob, a bonus that stacks with potions of Invisibility and sneaking.\n\nElytra are worn in the chestplate slot, allowing the wearer to glide through the air.\n\nMain article: Dye \u00a7 Dyeing armor Leather armor can be dyed, and colors can be mixed.\n\nDefault color HEX code for leather armor is #A06540.\n\nSince the 1.20 \"Trails and Tails\" update, armor trims can be applied to armor through the Smithing Table.\n\nThese are cosmetic changes to the armor that are found in a variety of structures.\n\nWhenever a piece of armor absorbs damage for the player, the armor itself is damaged, reducing its durability.\n\nAfter taking enough damage, the armor piece is completely destroyed.\n\nNote that if the damage is absorbed not by the armor itself, but by a protection enchantment of the armor, the armor is not damaged.\n\nEnchantments can also reduce the damage that armor normally does not reduce.\n\nThe following types of damage are reduced by armor and, consequently, damage the armor

Poison damage.\n\nFalling into the void or / kill.\n\nBeing inside of a powder snow block.\n\nThis excludes if the player or mob wears any piece of leather armor.\n\nThe armor bar as shown in game Armor defense points are controlled by an attribute, generic.armor.\n\nThe player 's current protection level is represented visually by the armor bar.\n\nThe armor meter is affected by the particular pieces that are worn as well as the tier of the armor.\n\nThe following table shows the number of defense points added by default by each individual piece of armor, as well as the total points added by a full set of armor for each material.\n\nDifferent combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.\n\nArmor can further protect the player through a second attribute, generic.armor_toughness.\n\nNormally, armor nullifies a lesser portion of damage from attacks that deal greater damage.\n\n[2] Armor toughness resists this effect, mitigating the power of strong attacks.\n\n[3] By default, only diamond and netherite armor provide toughness, with each piece granting +2 toughness for diamond and +3 for netherite.\n\nDifferent combinations of armor provide different levels of armor toughness.\n\nArmor toughness system includes a new formula for calculating damage: t o t a l D a m a g e = d a m a g e \u00d7 (1 \u2212 max (d e f e n s e P o i n t s 5, d e f e n s e P o i n t s \u2212 4 \u00d7 d a m a g e t o u g h n e s s + 8) 25) {\\displaystyle \\mathsf{totalDamage} = \\mathsf{damage}\\times \\left(1 - \\frac{\\text{max}\\left(\\frac{\\mathsf{defensePoints}}{5}, \\mathsf{defensePoints} - \\frac{4\\times\\mathsf{damage}}{\\mathsf{toughness}+8} \\right)}{25} \\right)} See also: Armor/Bedrock Edition Damage taken depends on the number of defense points, the toughness of the armor worn and the strength of the attack.\n\nd a m a g e = w e a p o n d a m a g e \u00d7 (1 \u2212 min (20, max (d e f e n s e p o i n t s 5, d e f e n s e p o i n t s \u2212 4 \u00d7 w e a p o n d a m a g e t o u g h n e s s + 8)) 25) {\\displaystyle \\mathsf{damage}=\\mathsf{weapon\\ damage}\\times\\left(1-\\frac{\\min\\left(20,\\max\\left(\\frac{\\mathsf{defense\\ points}}{5},\\mathsf{defense\\ points}-\\frac{4\\times\\mathsf{weapon\\ damage}}{\\mathsf{toughness}+8}\\right)\\right)}{25}\\right)} (Note: the min and max operators mean that only the minimum or maximum output of the two expressions that follow them (separated by commas) is used.\n\nfor example, \"y = min (2x, 16)\" means that \"y\" is equal to the smallest value out of \"2x\" and \"16\", while the largest is ignored.) Broken down, this means that each armor point gives 4% maximum damage reduction against an incoming attack.\n\nWithout toughness, this max damage reduction is lessened by 2 percentage points for each hit point of the incoming attack.\n\n2 defense points are worth 8% protection, so the total protection that can be achieved with armor is 80%.\n\nDiamond and netherite armors protect the player from up to 80% of damage, iron provides up to 60% damage reduction and leather provides up to 28%.\n\nOne piece of diamond armor (granting +2 toughness) decreases the defense reduction value for each attack hit point to 1.6%.\n\nTwo diamond pieces decrease it to 4 \u2044 3 % (about 1.3333%), three decrease it to 8 \u2044 7 % (about 1.1428%), and four decrease it to 1%.\n\nNetherite armor decreases this even further.\n\nOne piece of netherite armor reduce the defense reduction value for every hit point to 16 \u2044 11 (about 1.4545%), two decrease it to 8 \u2044 7 (about 1.1428%), three decrease to 16 \u2044 17 (about 0.9412%) and four decrease it to 0.8%.\n\nThe exact formula for the defense reduction in percent is: d e f e n s e r e d u c t i o n i n p e r c e n t = 16 \u00d7 d a m a g e t o u g h n e s s + 8 {\\displaystyle \\mathsf{defense\\ reduction\\ in\\ percent} = \\frac{16 \\times \\mathsf{damage}}{\\mathsf{toughness}+8}} Simply put, as toughness increases, the amount of defense reduction done by high-damaging attacks is diminished, and as toughness approaches a high value (through commands), the defense reduction caused by high-damaging attacks becomes negligible.\n\nThe final damage reduction value of the armor is capped at a minimum of 0.8% damage reduction per armor point, and to a maximum of 80% total.\n\nIf armor is cheated in so that the min cap is larger than the max cap, the min cap is ignored.\n\nAn illustration of the armor reduction is given below.\n\nIn tabular form (with a toughness of 0), damages are: Note that these damage values are lower if a player wears pieces of diamond armor or has toughness added to the armor through commands.\n\nWithout using cheats, armor values of 16 and above are impossible to obtain without at least one piece of diamond or netherite armor.\n\nEach netherite armor piece gives 10% of knockback reduction, protecting 40% with a full set.\n\nSee also: Enchanting Armor can be enchanted to provide various enchantments.\n\nEnchantments can provide more protection or allow armor to protect certain types of damage that armor doesn't normally protect against, such as fall damage or fire.\n\nDamage reduction from enchantments does not decrease the armor's durability.\n\nArmor enchantments do not appear on the armor bar.\n\nAn armor's material determines how enchantable it is.\n\nThe higher a material's enchantability, the greater the chances of getting multiple and high-level enchantments (see enchantment mechanics for details).\n\nAs with several enchantments, several different levels of protection are possible.\n\nThe maximum level of a protection enchantment is currently IV (4).\n\nProtection enchantments from multiple pieces of armor stack together, up to a calculated maximum.\n\nEach protection enchantment protects against specific types of damage.\n\nThe amount of damage reduction depends on the Enchantment Protection Factor (EPF) provided by that enchantment.\n\nWhen a player or mob wearing armor is subjected to damage, the EPFs of all applicable enchantments are added together, capped at 20, and then damage reduction is cappedEPF / 25, giving a maximum reduction of 20 \u2044 25 (80%) at EPF 20.\n\nBecause of the caps in the calculation, it is possible to achieve maximum protection against specific types of damage with just three pieces of armor.\n\nFor example, two pieces of armor with Blast Protection IV (EPF 8 each) and a single piece with Protection IV (EPF 4) would give a total EPF of 20 versus explosions.\n\nAny additional EPF would be wasted against explosions (but might be useful against other types of damage, if applicable).\n\nIf the damage is of a type that armor protects against normally, this reduction applies only to the damage that got through the armor.\n\nIt is possible using / give to obtain armor with an enchantment level higher than what is normally obtainable via normal survival.\n\nUsing this method, a player could give themselves, for example, a full set of diamond armor with a Protection V enchantment on every piece.\n\nFollowing the algorithm above, we find that, because Protection V has an EPF of 5, the armor reaches the maximum EPF of 20 for all types of damage.\n\nAny higher Protection enchantments could be used to reach the cap with just one level XX (20) enchantment, rather than having a full set of enchanted armor, but would be wasted if all pieces shared the same level enchantment.\n\nThe table below shows all armor enchantments at their max levels: Note: Only one form of protection can be applied to a piece of armor (i.e.\n\na chestplate cannot have both Fire Protection and Blast Protection, unless using commands to get all protection enchants in one piece of armor).\n\nFeather Falling, Frost Walker, Depth Strider and Soul Speed are enchantments applicable only to boots.\n\nRespiration and Aqua Affinity are enchantments applicable only to helmets.\n\nSwift Sneak is enchantment applicable only to leggings.\n\nAny hit from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4 of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1).\n\nThe following chart displays how many hits each piece of armor can endure.\n\nThe chart below shows the durability per unit of material for each piece of armor, compared to that of the boots.\n\nNote that the durability per unit does not depend on the tier of the armor.\n\nThis means that for the same number of leather / iron ingots / gold ingots /chainmail/ diamond, boots can take 1.5 more damage than leggings.\n\nThus, chestplates and leggings offer more defense points per unit, but have less durability per unit.\n\nArmor worn by a non- player mob does not lose durability when attacked by any means.\n\nHelmets that are worn by undead mobs lose durability when exposed to sunlight due to absorbing the mob's damage from sunlight.\n\nNetherite armor does not lose durability from lava or fire damage.\n\nCertain mobs can spawn equipped with random armor pieces.\n\nSome mobs also spawn with the ability to pick up the armor on the ground and equip them.\n\nThe probability of mobs spawning equipped with armor, whether the armor is enchanted, the level of the enchantment of the armor, and how many pieces of armor a mob spawns with depends on the difficulty; if a mob spawns with armor, the tier of armor (leather, gold, etc.) has a fixed probability: It is impossible for zombies and skeletons to naturally spawn with netherite armor.\n\nThe protection provided by armor and armor enchantments works the same with mobs as it does with players.\n\nThe following mobs can spawn with armor: Zombie Baby Zombie Zombie Villager Baby Zombie Villager Husk Baby Husk Skeleton Stray Piglin [4] The following do not naturally spawn with armor, but they do pick up dropped armor on normal or hard difficulty: Drowned Baby Drowned Zombified Piglin Baby Zombified Piglin Wither Skeleton Zombie Villager Baby Zombie Villager The following do not naturally spawn with armor, but they do pick up dropped armor and their armor does not render: Fox Baby Fox These mobs can have armor equipped on them via dispensers, but do not pick up armor: Piglin Brute These mobs can have armor equipped on them via dispensers, but their armor does not render: Villager Baby Villager These mobs cannot wear armor through survival mode means, but if equipped with commands, their armor is visible: Giant Pillager Vindicator Evoker All other mobs can be equipped via commands, although the armor cannot be seen.\n\nHelmets can protect mobs from burning in sunlight, depleting its durability as it absorbs the damage.\n\nEventually, the helmet loses all of its durability and breaks.\n\nPumpkins, mob heads, or anything placed into the head slot using commands, also protect mobs from burning in sunlight.\n\nDamage caused by any other source does not cause the mob's armor durability to decrease.\n\nLeather (on a zombie, or giant) Golden (on a zombie) Chainmail (on a zombie) Iron (on a zombie) Diamond (on a zombie) Netherite (on a

0.25 Blocks Height: 0.9875 Blocks Flamable Yes An armor stand is an inanimate entity that can wear armor.\n\nIt can also hold items and be posed (but these are not possible in Java Edition without commands).\n\nAn armor stand can be broken by quickly attacking it twice, dropping itself and any armor placed onto it.\n\nTwo armor stands are found in each taiga village outdoor armory, one equipped with an iron helmet, the other with an iron chestplate.\n\nPlayers can use armor stands to hold armor, mob heads, carved pumpkins, and elytra.\n\nCommands can be used to give them other items.\n\nThe stand does not have a GUI, so players interact with it directly.\n\nArmor stands are also able to be placed in different orientations, similar to banners or signs.\n\nArmor stands are entities, allowing them to be pushed by pistons, moved by flowing water, pulled with fishing rods, pushed by players (with knockback), and bounced by slime blocks.\n\nUsing armor on the stand places the armor if done on a bare spot.\n\nConversely, clicking on armor with a bare hand removes the armor and places it in the highlighted hotbar slot.\n\nIt is not possible to take or place items from the armor stand's hands unless playing on Bedrock Edition.\n\nArmor, mob heads, or carved pumpkins can be automatically placed on armor stands with a dispenser.\n\nArmor stands can be customized further to have arms, pose, disobey gravity, dual wield and other things by summoning them using / summon with NBT tags.\n\nIn maps heavily using command blocks, armor stands can be used to keep scoreboard objectives that are 'global' to the map, run commands, etc.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the pose of the armor stand can be changed by interacting with the armor stand (or pressing the Pose button on mobile devices) while sneaking, or by using a redstone signal.\n\nThere are 13 possible poses.\n\nArmor stands can also hold items by interacting with the armor stand (or pressing the Equip button on mobile devices) while holding an item that cannot be worn.\n\nBelow are the poses: Because armor stands are entities, they obey gravity, allowing them to fall and rest on non-full blocks such as enchanting tables, snow layers and slabs.\n\nAny armor on the stand drops when the stand is broken.\n\nArmor stands can display enchanted and all forms of dyed armor.\n\nThe effects of most enchanted armor have no effect when on an armor stand, with three exceptions: Frost Walker creates frosted ice blocks on water as usual if an armor stand is pushed with a piston.\n\nDepth Strider slows the movement of the armor stand when being pushed with water.\n\nA player may take damage from hitting an armor stand that holds armor enchanted with Thorns.\n\nArmor stands are not damaged by cacti but can be broken by arrows.\n\nAn armor stand destroyed by an explosion or a firework does not drop as an item.\n\nArmor stands in water and lava at the same time are not consumed by the lava.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, armor stands can be affected by status effects.\n\nThey can be 'killed' by Harming and Decay splash / lingering potions, lava, fire, and campfires, and they play the player death sound and fall to their side and disappear, yielding no armor stand item.\n\nIf an armor stand is equipped with an item or armor, that item or armor is considered as \"naturally-spawned equipment\" with an 8.5% chance of dropping when the armor stand \"dies\" from the Instant Damage or the Wither status effect.\n\nIf the dropped item is any form of weapon, tool or armor, it drops in a badly damaged state because the game considers it as \"naturally-spawned equipment\".\n\n[1] The stand wobbles slightly when being hit by the player.\n\nIn Java Edition, it is possible to create an armor stand with arms using the / summon command.\n\nIt is also possible to change an armor stand without arms into a stand with arms by using the / data command.\n\nThe commands are as follows: /data merge entity @e[type=armor_stand,sort=nearest,limit=1] {ShowArms:1}, which changes the nearest armor stand into an armor stand with arms.\n\n/summon minecraft:armor_stand ~ ~ ~ {ShowArms:1}, which summons a new armor stand with arms shown.\n\n/summon armor_stand ~ ~ ~ {Rotation:[0.0f]}, which summons a new armor stand that faces a desired direction (dependent on changing \"0.0f\" to other numbers like \"90.0f\" or \"180.0f\", otherwise it faces the same way as a default armor stand).\n\nJava Edition: Armor stands use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Main article: Player.dat format tag: The item's tag tag.\n\nEntityTag: Stores entity data that is applied to the entity when created.\n\nSee Entity Format.\n\nBedrock Edition: In Bedrock Edition, armor stands have no additional item tag.\n\nSee Bedrock Edition level format/Item format.\n\nArmor stands have entity data associated with them that contain various properties of the entity.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to mobs except LeftHanded, DeathLootTable, DeathLootTableSeed, NoAI, Leash, CanPickUpLoot and PersistenceRequired.\n\nTags common to all mobs DisabledSlots: Bit field allowing disable place/replace/remove of armor elements.\n\nFor example, the value 16191 or 4144896 disables placing, removing and replacing of all equipment.\n\nThese can be found using the bitwise OR operator.\n\nInvisible: 1 or 0 (true/false) -

arrows have a despawn timer of 60 seconds.\n\nMain article: Cauldron \u00a7 Potions In Bedrock Edition, tipped arrows can also be obtained by using arrows on cauldrons that contain potions.\n\nThe number of tipped arrows created depends on the potion inside the cauldron.\n\nWhen the cauldron is 1 \u2044 3 full, 16 arrows can be tipped.\n\nWhen the cauldron is 2 \u2044 3 full, up to 32 arrows

can reach is around 66 blocks.\n\nAn arrow fired in water experiences much more drag than in air: it moves less than 8 blocks before completely losing horizontal speed and falling straight down, although the knockback of the arrow remains unaffected.\n\nIt also leaves a trail of bubbles in its wake.\n\nThere is a random variable to the trajectory of an arrow, given by this.rand.nextGaussian() * 0.0075 * (double)inaccuracy for the x, y, and z coordinate.\n\nThe inaccuracy is relatively small, becoming noticeable over larger distances.\n\nThe inaccuracy of different arrow delivery devices may differ.\n\nDispensers fire with an inaccuracy of 6, while bows fire with an inaccuracy of 1.\n\nAn arrow's speed determine the damage it inflicts.\n\nThe damage inflicted is calculated by multiplying the arrow's damage value with its velocity in blocks per game tick.\n\nWhen fired from a fully-charged unenchanted bow, arrows do 6 of damage, with a smaller chance to damage for up to 11 \u00d7 5.5 via critical hits.\n\nThey inflict up to 5 damage from a medium-charged bow, and 1 from a bow with no charge.\n\nArrows fired from dispensers always do 3 of damage unless their velocity is modified by an external source.\n\nArrows fired from crossbows do 6 to 11 \u00d7 5.5 of damage.\n\nArrows trigger damage immunity on hit.\n\nHowever, unlike other methods of damage that may bypass invulnerability under certain conditions, arrows hitting the mob while it is invulnerable lose all speed and drop to the ground, dealing no damage unless they contact another mob.\n\nAn arrow shot into a tree.\n\nArrows also stick into objects they come in contact with and remain there for one minute before disappearing; the distance from the object and the angle determine how far into the target the arrow penetrates.\n\nSuch arrows may be retrieved.\n\nIf the arrow has any custom potion effects (NBT tag CustomPotionEffects), all potion effects, including vanilla potion effects (NBT tag Potion) are removed 30 seconds after the arrow stops moving.\n\nIf an arrow is stuck in a block, and that block is broken or disappears (e.g., leaves upon decay), then the arrow falls straight down and damages entities below, but never deals a critical hit.\n\nThe 1-minute despawn timer is then refreshed, meaning it will take another minute for the arrow to despawn.\n\nArrows bounce off players and mobs immune to damage, like a player in Creative mode, a wither under the \"wither armor\" effect, and a perching ender dragon.\n\nArrows shot through lava or (if there's at least a 2 block gap) fire catch on fire and show an appropriate animation until they pass through water.\n\nLike arrows shot from a bow with the Flame enchantment, they can set other entities they hit on fire for 5 seconds as well as ignite TNT and campfires.\n\nAn arrow shot at any kind of boat [JE only ], boat with chest [JE only ], or minecart causes the vehicle to break, dropping any components (including container contents).\n\nArrows can get visually stuck in players in Java Edition, although not any mobs.\n\nThey appear as regular arrows regardless of type.\n\n[2] Steve got shot.\n\nAlex got shot.\n\nAn arrow can activate a wooden button, wooden pressure plate, a tripwire, or a target.\n\nAn arrow will continue to power these blocks until it is removed or moved out of the \"activation zone\", either due to despawning, or being picked up.\n\nTarget blocks emit a redstone pulse for one second, as opposed to the static depressed state of the other switches.\n\nNon-wooden switches are not affected by arrows.\n\nWhen arrows are fired into the sides of blocks, they change their orientation to point more downward than their original flight path might indicate.\n\nThis can cause them to intersect and thus trigger switches above them that they didn't actually hit, or block rails above them.\n\nArrows are affected by explosions while they are in flight.\n\nSince explosions can increase the speed of an arrow, they can also increase the damage dealt by them.\n\n [Java Edition only ] See also: \u00a7 Crafting Tipped arrows are arrows that imbue a potion effect when hitting a mob or player.\n\nThe duration of the effect is 1 \u2044 8 that of the corresponding potion, if applicable, and is not affected by the power of the arrow.\n\nThe status effect is the same as the regular power effect for the potion.\n\nIf a bow is enchanted with Infinity, tipped arrows are still consumed.\n\nThe types of arrows are: Arrow of Regeneration Arrow of Swiftness Arrow of Fire Resistance Arrow of Healing Arrow of Night Vision Arrow of Strength Arrow of Leaping Arrow of Invisibility Arrow of Poison Arrow of Weakness Arrow of Slowness Arrow of Harming Arrow of Water Breathing Arrow of Luck  [JE only ] Arrow of Decay  [BE only ] Arrow of the Turtle Master Arrow of Slow Falling Arrow of Weaving Arrow of Infestation Arrow of Wind Charging Arrow of Oozing Arrows of Harming (and arrows of Healing when used against undead mobs) do not add a static amount of damage to the arrow.\n\n[3] Instead, the arrow's damage is first calculated, then checked to see if it is below 12 \u00d7 6.\n\nIf the arrow's damage is less than 12, the Harming effect of the arrow makes up the difference, to ensure the arrow does exactly 12 \u00d7 6.\n\nTherefore, an unenchanted bow cannot deal more than 12 damage using Harming (or Healing) arrows, as it can deal a maximum of 11 \u00d7 5.5 damage on level ground.\n\nHowever, if the arrow would deal more than 12 damage, the harming effect is entirely neutralized.\n\nThis means that bows enchanted with Power I through Power III has a chance to not utilize the arrow at full charge, and any Power level above III never utilizes Arrows of Harming effectively at full charge when against unarmored mobs or players.\n\nIt is possible to craft tipped arrows using lingering water bottles as well as Awkward, Thick, and Mundane lingering potions.\n\nIf crafted with a water bottle, the arrow is called an arrow of Splashing.\n\nIf crafted with Mundane, Awkward, or Thick potions, it is called a tipped arrow.\n\n[4] Tipped arrows crafted from different potions do not stack, as resultant tipped arrows all have different potion tags.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, all four kinds as well as the long mundane tipped arrow aren't obtainable either in creative, by cauldrons, by crafting, or by commands.\n\nAll four kinds generate blue particles in flight and upon landing, but otherwise behave like regular arrows.\n\nIn particular, arrow of Splashing has no effect on fire and campfires and when shot from a bow with the Flame enchantment, can light campfires and TNT just like regular arrows on fire.\n\nIn Java Edition, the uncraftable tipped arrow is a tipped arrow with no effect that is unobtainable in regular gameplay.\n\nIt is available in two variants that don't stack together: / give @s minecraft:tipped_arrow{Potion:\"minecraft:empty\"} - arrow assigned an effect placeholder \"empty\" / give @s minecraft:tipped_arrow - arrow not assigned any effect.\n\nThe uncraftable arrow doesn't differ from regular arrows in behavior when used as a projectile.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Java Edition.\n\nA spectral arrow confers the Glowing status effect for 10 seconds.\n\nThe Glowing effect creates an outline of the target, which is visible through blocks, and colored based on the target's team (white by default).\n\nEven if a bow is enchanted with Infinity, spectral arrows are still consumed.\n\nSpectral arrows can be acquired through bartering or crafted by combining 4 glowstone dust with one arrow, yielding 2 spectral arrows.\n\nJava Edition: Arrows and spectral arrows use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 Depends on how long the bow is charged for, around 1.2 with a fully charged bow.\n\nThe exact formula is 1 r a n d o m F l o a t () \u00d7 4 + 1.2 + progress 2 {\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{\\operatorname{randomFloat()}\\times 4+1.2}+\\frac{\\text{progress}}{2}}.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: In Bedrock Edition, arrows use the following item data values: Arrows have entity data that define various properties of the entity.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all arrows Tags common to all entities Tags common to all projectiles Note: An arrow entity is a tipped arrow if it has either the Potion or CustomPotionEffects tag.\n\nTags common to all potion effects Color: Used by the arrow entity, for displaying the custom potion color of a fired arrow item that had a CustomPotionColor tag.\n\nThe numeric color code are calculated from the Red, Green and Blue components using this formula: Red << 16 + Green <<8 + Blue.\n\nFor positive values larger than 0x00FFFFFF, the top byte is ignored.\n\nAll negative values remove the particles.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nSpectral arrows also have entity data that define various properties of the entity.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data

player stands close to a wall and fires several arrows without moving the crosshair, the arrows cluster around a point slightly to the right of the crosshair.\n\nIf the player switches their main hand to be the left hand in options, the arrows instead cluster to the left.\n\nArrows fired at Nether Portals often skip through the portal block completely and fail to collide, thus continuing through to the opposite side of the block.\n\nArrows stuck in blocks vibrate upon a world reload.\n\n[9] Although endermen teleport when hit by any tipped arrow, they are still given the said effects while avoiding arrow damage.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, even if a tipped arrow is blocked with a shield, while the direct damage from the arrows is negated, the player still gets the effect from the tipped arrow.\n\n[10] Arrow Spectral Arrow Tipped Arrows Splashing Night Vision Invisibility Leaping Fire Resistance Swiftness Slowness Turtle Master Water Breathing Healing Harming Poison Regeneration

bonemealable plant found primarily in jungles, which is used for crafting (particularly scaffolding and bamboo wood), smelting and breeding pandas.\n\nA bamboo shoot is the initial non-solid sapling form of planted bamboo.\n\nBamboo shoots cannot be obtained through vanilla means.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, they can be obtained through add-ons or inventory editing.\n\nIn Java Edition, they are completely unobtainable.\n\nBamboo can be mined with any tool, but a sword breaks the block instantly, even with Mining Fatigue.\n\nFlowing water also breaks bamboo shoots, but not mature bamboo stalks.\n\n\u2191 Times are for unenchanted tools as wielded by players with no status effects, measured in seconds.\n\nFor more information, see Breaking \u00a7 Speed.\n\nBamboo generates in widely

drop by 1 per level.\n\nBamboo can be found while fishing in jungle biomes as a junk item.\n\nWhen broken, any bamboo block placed or grown above it is also broken.\n\nA bamboo block drops itself as an item if a piston pushes it or moves a block into its space.\n\nWhen bamboo is first placed as a shoot it's not solid and can be destroyed by water flowing into it.\n\nAfter growing at least one block taller it becomes solid and can't be destroyed by water.\n\nTo transform a bamboo shoot into a solid bamboo block place another bamboo on top of it.\n\nUnlike most plants, bamboo cannot be composted.\n\n[3] Bamboo can be planted on moss blocks  [JE only ], grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, gravel, mycelium, podzol, sand, red sand, suspicious sand, suspicious gravel, mud,

blocks.\n\nBamboo can grow up to 12\u201316 blocks tall.\n\nThe top of a bamboo plant requires a light level of 9 or above to grow.\n\nBecause bamboo breaks in almost the same way as sugar canes, a sugar cane farm can be easily adapted to this use.\n\nWhile water is not needed with such a farm, some spacing is recommended if the harvest is done manually as mature stalks are solid.\n\nBamboo items are eaten by pandas and can be used to speed up the growth of baby pandas.\n\nBamboo can also be used to breed pandas when at least 8 blocks of bamboo are within 5 blocks of the pandas, making the panda the only animal in the game to have extra breeding requirements.\n\nAt this point, the player can feed them bamboo and they mate to have a baby.\n\nBamboo can be used as fuel for smelting.\n\nEach bamboo item smelts 0.25 items.\n\nCrafting two bamboo into a stick and using that as fuel is equivalent, smelting 0.5 items.\n\nBamboo can be crafted into other items to increase its fuel efficiency.\n\nBy crafting 9 bamboo into 2 bamboo planks, 3 items can be smelted instead of 2.25, a 33.3% increase in efficiency.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the fuel efficiency can be further doubled

it.\n\nAt 3 blocks, the top 2 blocks have leaves and at 4 blocks the bamboo expands to 3\u00d73 pixels.\n\nAt 5 blocks tall, the top 3 blocks have leaves on them.\n\nAs the bamboo grows, the leaves

[Java Edition only ] In Bedrock Edition, expert-level cartographer and shepherd villagers both offer to sell one of 16 blank banners for 3 emeralds as part of their trades.\n\nIllagers that spawn carrying an ominous banner [JE only ] / illager banner [BE & edu only ] always drop it upon death.\n\nOverlapping block on a banner.\n\nOverlapping on a wall mounted banner.\n\nThere are 16 colored blank banners, and numerous patterns each available in each of the 16 colors.\n\nA banner can feature up to 6 different patterns.\n\nThe top layer of a banner (or the last pattern added) can be washed off by using it on a cauldron containing water.\n\nBanners, much like signs, can be placed both on the ground facing in any direction, or on a wall.\n\nThey gently sway as if affected by a breeze, regardless of dimension or location.\n\nBanners have no collision mask as they are completely non-solid, so entities can move through them.\n\nOther blocks (including other banners) can be placed on any edge of a banner's hitbox, which is only one block high despite the banner appearing as two blocks tall.\n\nThis makes it possible to overlap another solid block on the top half of a banner for floor banners, or the bottom half of wall banners.\n\nWhen a banner is placed on the side of a block, its position is set by the top block, and it is possible to place it so it appears half buried.\n\nBanners can also be placed in item frames, where they simply appear as their item model.\n\nWater and lava flow around banners.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, banners can be waterlogged.\n\nWater can be placed below wall banners Water flows around a banner on the ground Lava can create fire in air blocks next to banners as if the banners were flammable, but the banners do not burn (and cannot be burned by other methods).\n\nBanners also cannot be moved by pistons.\n\nIf a banner is renamed on an anvil, it retains its name when a pattern is added, but not when a pattern is removed.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Java Edition.\n\nWhile a banner cannot be equipped in the head slot in Survival mode, equipping it using commands causes it to appear on top of the player.\n\nThis is how raid captains wear banners [JE only ].\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition.\n\nWhile a banner cannot be equipped in the chestplate slot in Survival mode, equipping it using NBT editors causes it to appear on top of the player.\n\nThis is how raid captains wear banners [BE & edu only ].\n\nShields can have patterns applied to them using banners.\n\nThe shield pattern has a smaller resolution than the banner pattern, causing them to look different or offset.\n\nBanners that have more than six patterns, such as Ominous Banners or banners obtained through inventory editors, will be reduced to six patterns on the shield.\n\nBanners can be copied with a blank banner to make multiple identical banners.\n\nBanners with more than 6 patterns applied using commands cannot be copied in this manner.\n\nHow every banner appears In Java Edition on a map, including named banners.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Java Edition.\n\nIn Java Edition, using on a standing banner with a map selected places a marker of the banner's position on the selected map, and using on the banner again removes the marker.\n\nNote that wall banners cannot serve as map markers.\n\nThe marker has the same color as the banner's base without decorations.\n\nThe marker is removed if the banner is destroyed unless the map is locked using a cartography table.\n\nIf the banner is renamed, the name appears below the marker.\n\nSee also: List of patterned banners Example of a banner with more than 6 patterns, a result of using the / give command.\n\nA banner may have up to six layers of patterns, which are overlaid with the last-crafted on top.\n\nA banner can have up to 16 layers of patterns with the use of commands.\n\nThe total number of unique banners is approximately 2.3x10^16 (or 23 quadrillion).\n\nAny color banner can be used; the pattern overlays the color.\n\nIn Java Edition, a loom is used to make patterns.\n\nHowever, in Bedrock Edition, the patterns can be made in a loom or a crafting table.\n\nA banner can have more than six layers of patterns through the commands / give, / setblock or / fill.\n\nThis only works in Java Edition, as Bedrock Edition doesn't have any NBT commands.\n\nHere is an example of a mining banner with seven different patterns.\n\nThere is specific codes for the colors and patterns that you have to input.\n\n/give @p

there.\n\nWith 16 blank banners, 38 patterns of 16 colors each (608 uniquely-colored patterns), and 0 to 6 patterns per banner, the number of uniquely crafted banners is 16 \u00d7 (608 0 + 608 1 + 608 2 + 608 3 + 608 4 + 608 5 + 608 6) \u2248 809 quadrillion - 809 with 15 zeros (809,573,616,779,945,488).\n\nThe number of visually distinct banners is smaller, because one or more patterns may completely cover other patterns, or the entire banner, or be duplicated due to the symmetric set of patterns (e.g.\n\nfield or (yellow) + per pale azure (blue) = field azure + per pale or inverted).\n\nNot 38 patterns are available on BE, but 40 patterns of 16 colors each (640 uniquely-colored patterns), so the number is even greater.\n\n16 \u00d7 (640 0 + 640 1 + 640 2 + 640 3 + 640 4

patterns.\n\nIf a banner has over 6 patterns, only the six bottom-most patterns are displayed when hovered over in the inventory.\n\nThe Mojang logo is called \"Thing\" in-game, which could be

texture of the back side is the mirrored texture of the front side.\n\nCompared to the texture files, textures' colors are inverted in-game due to them acting as masks for the re-colored base texture,

copies the NBT tag of anything that the player points their crosshair to) actually have no difference with the base banner obtained by middle click.\n\nThe Illager Banner in Bedrock Edition is

    "content": "Bed View all renders Renewable Yes Stackable No Tool Any tool Blast resistance 25 Hardness 4 Luminous No Transparent Yes Flammable No Catches fire from lava JE: Yes BE: No A bed is a dyeable block that allows a player to sleep and to reset their spawn point to within a few blocks of the bed in the Overworld.\n\nIf the bed is obstructed or removed, the player spawns at the default world spawning location.\n\nIgloo A red bed naturally generates in each igloo.\n\nVillage Beds of various colors generate in village houses, depending on the specific structure and biome: Desert village houses have cyan, green, or lime beds.\n\nPlains village houses have white or yellow beds.\n\nSavanna village houses have orange, red, or yellow beds.\n\nSnowy taiga  [BE only ] and taiga village houses have blue or purple beds.\n\nSnowy tundra village houses have blue, red, or white beds.\n\nBeds can be mined with any tool, or without a tool.\n\n[1] A bed also drops itself as an item when pushed by a piston.\n\nJourneyman-level shepherd villagers sell 1 of 16 beds for 3 emeralds as part of their trades.\n\nPlayer falling asleep.\n\nBeds are used by pressing the use item button while looking at the bed.\n\nA player sleeps by using a bed during a thunderstorm, or at night (between 12542 and 23459 ticks in clear weather, when stars appear in the sky, or between 12010 and 23991 ticks in rainy weather).\n\nPlayers can sleep during a thunderstorm even if they are in a biome where it does not rain (i.e.\n\nDesert).\n\nAttempting to use a bed at any other time results in the message \"You can only sleep at night or during thunderstorms\".\n\nA player sleeps in a bed for 101 in-game ticks, or 5.05 seconds before the time skips to the next day.\n\nSleeping in a bed with the / gamerule doDaylightCycle set to false results in the player being kicked out of the bed after the 101 ticks, but does not change time of the world to day.\n\nSleeping in a bed is possible only in the Overworld.\n\nAttempting to sleep in a bed in the Nether, the End, and custom dimensions in which they are disabled causes it to explode and set fire to surrounding blocks; unless / gamerule respawnBlocksExplode  [Bedrock Edition only ] is set to false.\n\n[2] The explosion has power 5, which is stronger than TNT (4), but not as strong as a charged creeper or end crystal (6).\n\nThe explosion centers on the head part of the bed.\n\nVillagers can sleep normally in any dimension without the bed being blown up.\n\n[3] Upon death from a bed explosion, the message \" (Player) was killed by [Intentional Game Design] \" appears.\n\nThe player must be close to the bed to sleep.\n\nIf the player is close enough to click on the bed, but not close enough to sleep in it, the message \"You may not rest now, the bed is too far away\" [JE only ] /\"Bed is too far away\" [BE only ] appears.\n\nA player must be within 2 blocks of the bed in Java Edition or 3 blocks in Bedrock Edition to use the bed.\n\nIf a \"monster\" is within 8 blocks of the bed horizontally (in the X- and Z-axis), and 5 blocks vertically (in the Y-axis), the message \"You may not rest now, there are monsters nearby\" appears and the player is prevented from sleeping until the monsters leave or are killed.\n\nMost hostile mobs, as well as some neutral mobs prevent players from sleeping, as shown in the table below.\n\nIf the player has not entered a bed and didn't die for 3 in-game days, phantoms can spawn unless / gamerule doInsomnia is set to false.\n\nin Java Edition, this can be verified by checking if the \"Time Since Last Rest\" statistic is greater than 1.00 h.\n\nA hostile mob can wake a player that is sleeping.\n\nThe player also cannot sleep in a bed occupied by another player, resulting in the message, \"This bed is occupied\".\n\nA player can, however, sleep in a bed being used by a villager.\n\nThe player may first wake the villager (pressing use on the villager) and then quickly enter the bed before the villager can lie down again.\n\nThe villager reclaims the bed after the player wakes.\n\nThe villager is kicked out of its bed when a player attempts to sleep there.\n\nA player also cannot sleep while on fire, while poisoned, or while starving.\n\nIf all sleeping requirements are met and the player enters a bed, the player is positioned in the bed.\n\nThe player falls asleep as the screen fades to black.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the sleeping animation slowly lowers the player into bed.\n\nOnce all players in a world are asleep, after 5 seconds (100 ticks) the time of day changes to sunrise.\n\n(time 0) During this time, the chat window is focused, and the player can leave the bed by clicking the Leave Bed button.\n\nWaterlogged beds [Bedrock Edition only ] cannot be slept in unless the player or villager has the Water Breathing or Conduit Power status effects.\n\nAttempting to use a waterlogged bed otherwise does not display any message.\n\n[4] Beds displaying an error above the hotbar is a feature exclusive to beds; other blocks that cannot be used do not display such a message.\n\n[5] If there are two or more blocks of space above the bed, then the player can wake up on the bed.\n\nIf there is less than two blocks above the bed and there is room on the side, then the player wakes up on the side of the bed.\n\nIf there is no space on the side of the bed and there is less than two blocks above the bed, then the player still wakes up on top of the bed, but suffocates if it's a solid block.\n\nVillagers always wake up on top of the bed, meaning they can suffocate if there isn't enough room above the bed.\n\nSleeping changes the time of day to sunrise and resets the weather cycle, changing the weather to clear conditions.\n\nIn Java Edition, the weather cycle is only reset if it is currently raining or snowing.\n\nThe player wakes up next to the bed, facing the bed.\n\nSleeping does not accelerate processes that take place over time such as the growth of crops or smelting.\n\nIf / gamerule doDaylightCycle is false, the player instead wakes up in the night.\n\nTo skip the night in multiplayer, all players in the Overworld must be in bed at the same time.\n\nPressing the Leave Bed button is not necessary in this case.\n\nThe percentage of players that need to sleep to skip the night can be customized with the game rule playersSleepingPercentage.\n\nVillagers are unable to skip the night by sleeping in beds, unlike players.\n\nIf the bed is destroyed while the player is in it, due to for example an explosion or by another player, the player wakes prematurely and the night does not pass.\n\nOnce a player has entered a bed (or right clicked the bed during daytime), their spawn point is set to the location of that bed.\n\nIn Java Edition, multiple players can set their spawn point on a single bed.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the last player to use a specific bed is the only player who can respawn there, and players who had previously slept there respawn at the world spawn.\n\nUsing a bed in the daytime likewise sets the spawn point, without actually entering the bed.\n\nWhen a bed explodes, it does not set the spawn point.\n\nThe message \"Respawn point set\" is displayed in chat when the respawn point is successfully changed.\n\nThe check for a bed is made only when the player respawns.\n\nThis means that the bed can be destroyed and replaced or even reoriented, but as long as there is a bed present in the same location, the player can respawn there.\n\nIf a player's bed is absent, or if the area around the bed is made unsuitable for respawning (see below), a message is displayed saying You have no home bed or charged respawn anchor, or it was obstructed  [Java Edition only ] / Your home bed was missing or obstructed  [Bedrock Edition only ], and the player respawns at the world spawn point.\n\nWhen choosing where to respawn the player, the northwesternmost (lowest X- and Z-coordinates) location of the seven blocks adjacent to the head of the bed is chosen first.\n\nIf this location is obstructed, the next choice is to its south (+Z), rather than the east (+X).\n\nOnly when all seven locations around the head are obstructed are the three remaining ones adjacent to the foot then to be considered.\n\nFor a location to be unobstructed, the block at the level of the bed must be air or non-solid (e.g.\n\ntorches, but not glass) and there must be a space with a solid block below it and two non-colliding blocks for the player to stand in 0-2 blocks below the bed.\n\nIt does not matter if the bed itself has blocks above it.\n\nPutting a slab one block above a bed can act as a two block tall space, as the bed is half a block tall.\n\nThe bed never spawns the player on or directly below itself even if all other locations are obstructed.\n\nIf a bed is obstructed, the player's spawn point is cleared after they respawn.\n\nThat is, even if the bed is subsequently made usable again, the player continues to respawn at the world spawn until interacting with the bed again.\n\nSpecifically, when interacting with it, the location of the head of the bed is saved as the spawn point, and if a bed is in that space (whether it is the foot or the head) then the respawn works.\n\nThis can be observed by reorienting the bed with its head in the same location.\n\nInteracting with it does not produce a \"Respawn point set\" message as the game doesn't change the saved spawn point.\n\nIf a bed is reoriented so that its foot is in this space, it still functions on the next respawn, but it can also be interacted with to update the spawn point to the new head of the bed and cause a \"Respawn point set\" message.\n\nAttempting the reverse, reorienting the bed so that it overlaps the original location of the foot, results in a respawn at world spawn.\n\nHowever, the location of the foot of the bed is also saved.\n\nIf the bed is moved so that part of it overlaps the original location of the head, it can be observed that the same locations need to be obstructed to stop spawning.\n\nIt is possible to respawn 2 blocks away from the bed this way.\n\nFalling onto a bed bounces the player with 66% strength \u2013 the bouncing-up velocity is 66% of the impact velocity.\n\nThe player also takes 50% of normal fall damage.\n\nBaby villagers bounce on beds during the day.\n\nIf the player is falling while sleeping requirements are met, and presses use on a bed within reach before hitting the ground, the fall damage is delayed until the player wakes.\n\nA player can bounce on a bed while another player or villager is sleeping on it without waking the player or the villager up.\n\nVillagers can be pushed onto beds, as the bed is half a block tall.\n\nEach bed in the vicinity of a zombie villager has a chance to speed up the process of curing the zombie villager.\n\nIron bars (such as in a prison cell) also have this effect.\n\nBeds require two blocks of floor space.\n\nPlacement requires at least 2 blocks from the player's facing direction.\n\nWhen placed, the foot of the bed is placed on the block selected and the head of the bed on the block farther away from the player.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, beds require solid blocks below them when placed.\n\nHowever, the bed remains in place if its supporting blocks are later removed.\n\nIn Java Edition, beds do not require supporting blocks and can be placed anywhere, provided there is enough room.\n\nJava Edition: \u2191 a b MC-177082 Bedrock Edition: Java

[Java Edition only ] Boats can be used for the transportation of players and mobs, sold for emeralds, or burnt as fuel.\n\nMaster-level fisherman villagers always offer to buy a boat for an emerald.\n\nThe type of boat depends on the biome outfit type of the villager; plains villagers offer to buy oak boats, taiga and snowy villagers offer to buy spruce boats, savanna villagers offer to buy acacia boats, desert and jungle villagers offer to buy jungle boats, and swamp villagers offer to buy dark oak boats.\n\nA boat used as fuel in a furnace lasts 60 seconds, smelting up to 6 items.\n\nSee also: Transportation and Riding A player enters a boat by using it, if the boat is not fully occupied (boats can hold two entities).\n\nUnlike beds, there is no message above the hotbar for attempting to enter a fully occupied boat.\n\n[2] A boat can be exited by sneaking or, in Bedrock Edition, pressing down the right analog stick on a controller, tapping the \"Leave Boat\" button when using touch controls, or jumping.\n\nWhen exiting a boat, the player is placed in the direction the player is facing, or, if facing directly up or down, the player is placed in front of the boat.\n\nThe exiting player is placed on land if possible from the dismounting position.\n\nBoats do not turn with mouse-look.\n\nWith a keyboard or gamepad, boats are controlled using the forward, left (turns left), right (turns right), and backward keys.\n\nUsing the sprint key increases the field of vision, but does not increase speed as if sprinting.\n\nWith touchscreen controls, two buttons for steering appear.\n\nThe right button or key steers to the left, and the left button or key steers to the right.\n\nPressing both buttons or keys moves the boat forward.\n\nIn Java Edition, boats can be ridden against a current, but cannot be ridden upstream to a higher elevation.\n\nA boat lift, usually made from tripwire, pistons, and optionally a slime block, can be used to move a boat up.\n\nBubble columns created with soul sand can also be used to push boats upward.\n\nThese mechanisms can also be used in Bedrock Edition but are usually unnecessary because boats can be ridden upward in descending water, as well as follow upward stair-step currents.\n\nBoats move according to the player's control or water currents, with speed affected by the surface traversed.\n\nBoats move extremely quickly on ice, [3] allowing for the construction of fast transportation systems in any dimension.\n\nThe animation of an oak boat when atop a bubble column.\n\nA boat floats atop still or flowing water.\n\nIn Java Edition, a boat sinks if it enters a waterfall.\n\n[4] In Bedrock Edition, a boat does not sink when submerged but floats up.\n\nThis feature lets a player contrive stepped uphill water flows to propel a boat uphill using only flowing water.\n\nWhen a boat moves over a bubble column, it begins to shake.\n\nIf the bubbles are caused by a magma block, all passengers are expelled and the boat sinks.\n\nIn Java Edition, a sunken boat cannot be re-floated until a bubble column pushes it up or it is broken by the player.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a boat resumes floating when it emerges from the currents keeping it down, or when the bubble column is blocked or removed.\n\nDolphins chase players riding a boat in motion, occasionally bumping the boat, causing it to shake briefly.\n\nAs boats are entities, they have health.\n\nBoats effectively have just over 4 (exactly 4 damage is not quite enough to destroy a boat), and regenerate 1 \u2044 10 per game tick.\n\nBoats can be destroyed by explosions, fire and lava (but not magma blocks), cactus, and by being punched by mobs, such as Drowned.\n\nBoats made invulnerable with commands cannot be broken by any of these, but they still cannot be used to travel on lava because they sink.\n\nMultiple mobs in 2 types of boats.\n\nBoats can support two riders, including mobs.\n\nExcept for endermen in Bedrock Edition, a mob cannot exit a boat and is trapped until the boat gets destroyed, or until the player uses a fishing rod or lead to remove the mob.\n\nThis can be used to transport mobs, although hostile mobs still attack while in boats.\n\nMobs riding a boat don't despawn [Java Edition only ] and don't count toward the mob cap.\n\n[5] A player cannot both move (row) and use items at the same time.\n\nIt is still possible to initialize item use (e.g.\n\nstart eating) and row the boat while the item is still in the middle of the use animation.\n\nAlthough the rowing animation overrides the item use animation, the item can still be successfully consumed.\n\nThis does not work with items that are triggered by the release of the use button (such as bows and tridents). [Java Edition only ] Being in a boat limits the player's mouse-look to the forward 210\u00b0 arc in Java Edition and 180\u00b0 in Bedrock Edition.\n\nUnderwater boat cannot be ridden.\n\nWhen the boat is underwater, all passengers in it are expelled.\n\nRiding a boat does not deplete hunger, making it an efficient way to travel.\n\nBoats can completely nullify fall damage for themselves and any players/mobs inside, making them useful for travel through mountains or through the Nether.\n\n[6] [7] However in Java Edition, due to a bug, boats can break when falling from certain heights, and the riders take fall damage.\n\n[8] A boat has a solid collision box, which means players and other entities can't go through it even with high speed.\n\nFalling blocks are also blocked by boats.\n\nIn Java Edition, a boat falling on top of an entity stops on top of the entity.\n\nin Bedrock Edition, a falling boat can go through other entities.\n\nRiding a boat over a lily pad causes the lily pad to drop, although the boat's speed stutters a bit.\n\nMost mobs can ride boats.\n\nMobs cannot exit the boat unless the boat is destroyed, sinks, or moves over a bubble column.\n\nHowever, in Bedrock Edition, endermen are able to teleport out of boats.\n\nMobs can be picked up into the boat when they collide with the side of the boat.\n\nA mob cannot control the boat.\n\nIn Java Edition, a boat being ridden by a player cannot pick up a mob.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, mobs can be picked up by a boat being ridden by a player.\n\nMobs wider than the width of a boat cannot be picked up by a boat.\n\nWardens, and withers cannot be picked up by a boat.\n\nIn Java Edition, baby sniffers cannot be picked up either.\n\nLeads can be attached to boats, though the lead can break when stretched too far due to boats moving much slower on land.\n\nJava Edition: Boats use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Boats have entity data associated with them that contain various properties of the entity.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all boats Tags common to all entities Main article: Boat/DV [edit ] Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Boat\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nSand, red sand, concrete powder, gravel, anvils, and dragon eggs drop as items when they fall onto a boat that is in water.\n\nA chest is short enough that a boat falls onto it rather than crashes into it.\n\nIn Legacy Console Edition, holding the movement stick to the side in a boat on blue ice causes the player to spin quickly.\n\nIf a passenger is in the boat while this occurs, when the player exits the boat after it reaches maximum velocity (attained after about three seconds), for most mobs, the mob's head may spin uncontrollably.\n\nFor some mobs, however, nothing happens (such as slimes and ghasts).\n\nThe mob may also get its head stuck at an angle.\n\nThorough testing was done on Minecraft: Wii U Edition, although the glitch was originally discovered on the Xbox 360 Edition.\n\nOak Spruce Birch Jungle Acacia Dark oak Mangrove Cherry Bamboo raft Oak Spruce Birch Jungle Acacia Dark oak Mangrove Cherry Bamboo raft All types of boats next to each other.\n\nThe old boat floating.\n\nA bunch of pre-1.9 boats stacked up.\n\nFirst image of boats in BE development.\n\nSecond image of boats in BE development.\n\nImage of the completed Bedrock Edition boats.\n\nA trail of boats after a game crash while riding a boat.\n\nA dock with many boats.\n\nA third-person perspective of a boat in Java Edition Alpha v1.0.6.\n\nJappa texturing a boat.\n\nNekofresa making the bamboo raft in Blockbench.\n\nBoat item textures.\n\nBoat item textures.\n\nBoat item textures.\n\nBoat item textures.\n\nBamboo raft concept art.\n\nDitto.\n\nOfficial artwork of Sunny riding a mangrove boat.\n\nOfficial artwork of Alex in a boat at sea with an Allay.\n\nPixel art of Zuri on a bamboo raft with a baby panda.\n\nCutout of Zuri and Efe on bamboo rafts, featured in the Trails & Tales Event.\n\nAn oak boat as it appears in an advertisement for Crocs.\n\n[13] Transportation \u2191 MC-170868 \u2014 resolved as \"Invalid\".\n\n\u2191 MC-161251 - resolved as \u201cWorks as Intended\u201d \u2191 a b MC-97803 \u2014 \"Boats going faster on ice than in water\" \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 MC-91206 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 MC-182897 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 MC-105103 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 MCPE-149490 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 Cite error: Invalid <ref> tag;

[Java Edition only ] In Bedrock Edition, they drop bones instead.\n\nWhen a composter is completely filled, a single bone meal drops the next time the composter is used.\n\nWandering traders sell 3 bone meal for an emerald. [Bedrock Edition only ] In Bedrock Edition, bone meal can be also used in banner patterns: In Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, bone meal can be: Applied to sheep to dye their wool, which can then be sheared for 1\u20133 blocks of white wool.\n\nApplied to tamed wolves and cats to dye their collars.\n\nUsed to dye or stain carpets, candles, leather armor, leather horse armor, wolf armor, beds, glass, glass panes, terracotta, shulker boxes, and bundles.\n\nCombined with gunpowder to make a firework star.\n\nCombined with a firework star to create a fade-to-color effect.\n\nUsed to add patterns to banners.\n\nUsed to dye shulkers in Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education.\n\nUsed to dye water contained in cauldrons in Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education.\n\nCombined with sand and gravel to craft concrete powder.\n\nCombined with compounds to craft balloons or glow sticks in Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education.\n\nUsed to change the color of the text on signs or hanging signs.\n\nBone meal can also be used on the following plants to have a chance to increase their growth stage: Bone meal does not affect: Cactus Vines Nether wart Sugar cane  [Java Edition only ] Chorus plants, or other plants not listed above.\n\nBone meal can be used on the following objects in the following situations, consuming it without any real effect: On grass, ferns, and seagrass that do not have enough space to grow.\n\n[2] On seagrass that doesn't have water above.\n\nOn a dark oak sapling that is not in a group of four.\n\n[3] On a mushroom that is not on a block that allows it to grow into a huge mushroom.\n\n[4] On a sea pickle that is already in a group of four and has no valid locations to expand to.\n\n[5] On a bamboo (not bamboo shoot) that is blocked in the way.\n\nOn a sea pickle that is not on a coral block.\n\nOn a fungus that is not on its respective nylium.\n\nAny plants that can't grow due to being block by the build limit.\n\nIf bone meal is used on a grass block; tall grass, grass, flowers, and pink petals form on the targeted block and on random adjacent grass blocks in an 15\u00d75\u00d715 [JE only ] /7\u00d75\u00d77 [BE only ] area centered on the targeted block.\n\nThe flowers/pink petals that appear depend on the biome, meaning that in order to obtain specific flowers, the player must travel to biomes where the flowers are found naturally.\n\nSee Flower \u00a7 Flower biomes for more information.\n\nUsing bone meal on a 2-block flower (rose bushes, sunflowers, lilacs or peonies) will cause one of the same type of flower to drop, without breaking the original.\n\nThis is the only way to reproduce these flowers, since they cannot generate from using bone meal on grass blocks.\n\nUsing bone meal on a non-transparent block that is underwater generates seagrass on that block and surrounding blocks.\n\nSometimes, if in a warm ocean biome, coral and coral fans may have a chance to generate as well, and in Bedrock Edition, coral (not coral fan) can be generated in any biome.\n\nIn order for this to work, there must be 2 water blocks above the block the bone meal is being used on, and the lower one must be non-flowing water.\n\nUsing bone meal on a sea pickle on a coral block creates sea pickles.\n\nThis generates sea pickles up to 3 blocks (of coral) away, so a 7+ \u00d7 7+ block (49+ blocks) of coral may be necessary, to return the most sea pickles per given bone meal attempt (more attempts grows them more numerously, exactly - including the range of it growing, like grass with heights on grass blocks - as coral and coral fans, though those others being non-solid blocks).\n\nUsing bone meal on netherrack adjacent to nylium converts the netherrack into nylium of the same type.\n\nIf both crimson and warped nylium are adjacent to the netherrack that was applied with bone meal, there is a 50% chance that either type of nylium is created.\n\nUsing bone meal on nylium causes the corresponding roots and both types of fungi to appear on the nylium block and other nylium nearby, with the type of fungi matching the type of nylium being more common.\n\nIn addition, using bone meal on the side of warped nylium creates nether sprouts and twisting vines.\n\nVillagers with the farmer profession can collect bone meal from a full composter, with which they can make their crops grow faster.\n\nJava Edition: Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Issues relating to \"Bone Meal\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nBone meal can be used on the sides or bottom of a grass block, as well as on a grass block with plants already on top of it.\n\nRegardless of if it succeeds in fertilizing, bone meal makes green sparkles.\n\nHowever, like smoke from a torch, the sparkles appear only if the player has particles set All or Decreased.\n\nIn real life, bone meal is used as a fertilizer to provide nitrogen and phosphorus to plants.\n\nBone meal used on grass blocks.\n\nFarming \u2191 MC-150278 \u2191 MC-125642 \u2191 MC-168446 \u2191 MC-173213 \u2191 MC-127995 \u2191 https://web.archive.org/web/20220921040940/https://imgur.com/a/gOngk Items View at: Template:Items/content [edit ]",

[Java Edition only ] Fully charged shots launch critical arrows which have a trail of particles behind them and deal up to (3 x 2) + 2 {\\textstyle \\left (\\frac{3x}{2} \\right) + 2} damage, where x {\\displaystyle x} is the damage after any enchantments.\n\nThe listed values below describe maximum damage from a bow with no Power enchantments, assuming the target is at a distance where drag and gravity are negligible.\n\nHowever, the critical damage is likely to be more around 8-10; critical damage is added at a random value between x {\\displaystyle x} and (3 x 2) + 2 {\\textstyle \\left (\\frac{3x}{2} \\right) + 2} and it is rare to have minimum or maximum values.\n\nThe damage dealt can ultimately be less than the maximum damage if the arrow slows down after being shot.\n\nThe game stores the damage of arrows even in values with a decimal point.\n\nFor example, it is possible for a critical arrow shot to cause damage values such as 6.4.\n\nIn this cases of a broken value, the game can round up or down and store the amount for subsequent damage sources.\n\nAny projectile thrown by the player is under the influence of momentum in current versions of Minecraft.\n\nNaturally, the player's movement speed can be modified under a number of circumstances, affecting the ballistic trajectory of projectiles, and as a result, the damage inflicted by arrows.\n\nIn Java Edition Combat Tests, to avoid sniping, arrows shot from fully-charged bows become non-critical if held drawn back for longer than three seconds.\n\nInstantaneous effects on tipped arrows are scaled by 1/8, just like the duration of other effects.\n\nFor example, Instant Damage I arrow will deal an additional 0.75 \u00d7 0.375 magical damage.\n\nDamage caused by the arrow is not affected by the Strength effect.\n\nEndermen cannot be shot using an arrow, because the arrow either disappears as the enderman teleports, or it gets deflected.\n\nEven while immobile, the enderman is immune to damage from arrows.\n\nHowever, an arrow shot from a bow enchanted with Flame can ignite the enderman.\n\nBows can receive several different enchantments and have a base enchantability of 1.\n\nBow enchantments have no effect on arrow speed or the distance it travels.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, if a bow is enchanted with any level 1 enchantment, it always gets Power I.\n\n[verify ] Notes \u2191 a b Mending and Infinity are mutually exclusive.\n\nA bow can be used as fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per bow in Java Edition or 1 item per bow in Bedrock Edition.\n\nMain article: Arrow As in real life, a flying arrow in Minecraft is affected by gravity.\n\nIts vertical speed is modified by one block downward every second, resulting in a parabolic flight path.\n\nAn arrow slows down if shot through water, reducing its damage to near zero unless brought back into the air or otherwise given momentum. [Java Edition only ] Arrows that hit solid blocks become stuck and can be retrieved, unless the arrow was shot by a bow enchanted with Infinity, a player in Creative mode, or a mob.\n\nAn arrow shot through lava ignites, giving it the effect of the Flame enchantment, igniting any entity it hits.\n\nIf not extinguished, the fire inflicts up to 4 damage.\n\nAlthough a wither skeleton does not spawn naturally with bows, if it holds a bow then it also shoots flaming arrows.\n\nOn impact, an arrow can trigger a wooden pressure plate, target block, wooden button, or tripwire.\n\nArrows cannot trigger stone pressure plates or stone buttons.\n\nThe player can choose the type of arrow to shoot based on its location in the inventory.\n\nArrows in the off-hand, or the selected hotbar slot if the bow is in the off-hand, are prioritized first.\n\nIf there are no arrows in the off-hand or selected hotbar slot then the arrow closest to slot 0 is selected.\n\nArrows shot by bows in Bedrock Edition has a slightly higher range than arrows shot by bows in Java Edition.\n\nJava Edition: \u2191 Depends on how long the bow has been charging.\n\nuncharged bows give 5 \u2044 6 -0.625 Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Historical sounds: Issues relating to \"Bow\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nBows were left unchanged in the Texture Update.\n\n[4] Dinnerbone got the idea for the high-pitched \"ding\" sound from playing on a former PvP server called Project Ares.\n\n[5] [6] An enchanted bow.\n\nUsing the bow.\n\nDrawback animation.\n\nBow in the Super Duper Graphics Pack.\n\nUsing a bow to hunt rabbits.\n\n\u2191 MC-87685 \u2014 \"Drawn bow texture does not reflect arrow that will be shot\" \u2014 resolved as \"Won't Fix\".\n\n\u2191 MCPE-116741 \u2191 MCPE-116741 \u2191 MC-168156 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 \"Also things I learnt from pvping today: Bows need to ding when you hit people (it's so much fun/rewarding!) & arrows don't render far enough\" \u2013 @Dinnerbone (Nathan Adams) on X, December 15, 2012 \u2191 \"Minecraft PvP with Dinnerbone & Docm77 - Team DocBone @ 11:52\" \u2013 docm77 on YouTube, December 7, 2013 Taking Inventory: Bow \u2013 Minecraft.net on April 13, 2023 Items View at: Template:Items/content [edit ]",

[Java Edition only ] If a named mob is captured in Bedrock Edition, the item is called \"Bucket of <Name>\".\n\nTropical fish also have assigned names that can be seen after capture.\n\nIn Java Edition, the smaller text under the item name is displayed showing the fish name, similar to the text that displays enchantments under enchanted items.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the item name is displayed showing \"Bucket of <fish name>\".\n\nTheir colors are mostly named according to the colored block names, though with a few exceptions: White Silver Gray Black Brown Red Orange Yellow Lime Green Teal Sky Blue Plum Magenta Rose The base color comes first, and if the pattern color is different, it comes after that.\n\nLastly, the fish bucket is given a name according to the shape and pattern of the fish: Some tropical fish don't follow the normal naming system, and instead, reference real-life fish species.\n\nApart from these names, these types of fish aren't different from regular tropical fish in terms of design or behavior.\n\nThese varieties are: A bucket of tropical fish purchased from a wandering trader or pulled from the Creative inventory spawns random tropical fish when used, due to it having no associated NBT.\n\nAdditionaly, buckets of tropical fish may be used to lead and breed axolotls.\n\nIt can also speed up the growth of a baby axolotl.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, if an axolotl is picked up with a bucket, the bucket appears in the player's inventory as \"Bucket of <Baby/Adult> <Color> Axolotl\" based on the age and color of the axolotl.\n\nThese varieties are: Bucket of Baby Leucistic Axolotl Bucket of Adult Leucistic Axolotl Bucket of Baby Brown Axolotl Bucket of Adult Brown Axolotl Bucket of Baby Gold Axolotl Bucket of Adult Gold Axolotl Bucket of Baby Cyan Axolotl Bucket of Adult Cyan Axolotl Bucket of Baby Blue Axolotl Bucket of Adult Blue Axolotl When the player spawns in an axolotl with a bucket of axolotl from the creative inventory, it is always a leucistic adult.\n\nBuckets containing other variants will always spawn that variant when used in creative mode.\n\nThe bucket of axolotl does not change textures in the inventory to reflect the captured axolotl's color, it always appears leucistic.\n\nWhen a tadpole is picked up with a bucket, the bucket appears in the player's inventory as \"Bucket of tadpole\".\n\nThe bucket can be emptied again like any other bucket of aquatic mob, depositing the tadpole and water on the targeted location.\n\nThe water in the bucket of tadpole appears green, unlike the other buckets of aquatic mobs, in which water appears blue.\n\nJava Edition: Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Main article: Player.dat format tag: The item's tag tag.\n\nBucketVariantTag: The variant data of the tropical fish in the bucket.\n\nApplies only to Bucket of Tropical Fish.\n\nEntityTag: Stores entity data that is applied to the aquatic mob when it is poured out.\n\nIf this data includes a tropical fish variant, it overrides the one provided in BucketVariantTag.\n\nSee entity format.\n\nNormal buckets of fish use only the BucketVariantTag tag to store the variant of any tropical fish that is picked up, and the item's display name to store the fish's custom name.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Item format.\n\nTeaser for bucket of axolotl and powder snow.\n\nTeaser for bucket of axolotl and powder snow.\n\nFirst image of a bucket of tadpole.\n\nIssues relating to \"Bucket of Fish\", \"Bucket of Mob\", \"Bucket of Cod\", \"Bucket of Salmon\", \"Bucket of Pufferfish\", \"Bucket of Tropical Fish\", or \"Bucket Of Tadpole\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nWhen a water bucket is transformed into a bucket of aquatic mob, it actually pushes the bucket texture down one pixel.\n\nAccording to Dinnerbone, JAPPA says this is due to the \"weight of the fish\".\n\n[2] Buckets of tropical fish always appear to contain a clownfish, regardless of whatever fish is actually inside.\n\n[3] The bucket of cod and bucket of tropical fish are actually re-colorations of each other.\n\n\u2191 MC-130015 \u2191 MC-127919 \u2191 MC-126761 Taking Inventory: Bucket of Fish \u2013 Minecraft.net on March 26, 2020 Taking Inventory: Bucket of Axolotl \u2013 Minecraft.net on July 14, 2022 Items View at: Template:Items/content [edit ]",

fire charges, blaze fireballs, and ghast fireballs when / gamerule mobGriefing is true.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, campfires can also be lit by using an item enchanted with fire aspect, or stepping on it while burning.\n\nCampfires can be extinguished by waterlogging it (placing water in the same block space), throwing a splash water bottle on it, or using a shovel on it.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, campfires can also be extinguished by placing a water source or allowing water to flow in the space above the campfire.\n\nAs with torches, rain does not extinguish campfires.\n\n[1] Using flint and steel on the side of a waterlogged or lit campfire sets the adjacent air block on fire instead.\n\nAny items cooking on a campfire always drop when the campfire block is broken.\n\nCampfire emitting smoke.\n\nCampfires produce smoke particles that float up around 10 blocks before disappearing.\n\nIf a hay bale is placed below, the campfire becomes a signal fire and the smoke floats up 24 blocks instead.\n\nCampfire smoke particles can partially pass through a block directly above it, but do not pass through blocks more than one block directly above it.\n\nAlthough a trap door is thinner than a slab, a trap door can block the smoke completely, preventing the smoke from floating up.\n\nCampfires emit extra smoke particles during rain, similar to lava.\n\nCampfires also emit occasional ember particles, similar to lava.\n\nSoul campfires, however, do not emit embers.\n\n[2] Campfires damage mobs standing on top of them even if underwater (with exceptions such as shulkers, zombified piglins or guardians), but only if lit.\n\nCampfires deal 1 and soul campfires deal 2 of damage every tick (although damage immunity reduces this to once every half-second) Campfires do not cause lasting

enchantments.\n\nThe player can avoid being damaged at all, either by using a potion of fire resistance or wearing Frost Walker boots.\n\nRegardless of height, all blocks prevent damage done to mobs or players above campfires.\n\nThe campfire deals damage only to entities occupying its block.\n\nThe player can place raw food on a lit campfire by using the food item on it.\n\nUp to four food items can be placed on a single campfire, which cooks the items simultaneously.\n\nUnlike other blocks that can cook food, campfires do not require any kind of fuel to cook.\n\nOn a campfire, foods produce small smoke particles, indicating they are being cooked.\n\nFood items take 30 seconds (600 ticks) to cook, compared to 10 seconds for furnaces or 5 seconds for smokers.\n\nAssuming that one uses all four slots to cook at once, the Campfire is, therefore, more efficient than furnaces (taking 10 seconds less per four items and no fuel) for cooking, but must be watched so as to pick up the food and refill it once it is done.\n\nIt is slower than a smoker by about ten seconds, but its lack of fuel consumption could be seen as a worthwhile trade-off.\n\nOnce finished cooking, items pop off the campfire.\n\nIf the campfire is extinguished while cooking food, it resets as if it had not been cooked at all.\n\nFood items can be placed on an unlit campfire.\n\nOther items can be placed on campfires using external editors, mods or add-ons.\n\nCampfires do not have an external inventory.\n\nRaw food cannot be loaded into the campfire with a hopper.\n\nA hopper placed directly underneath a campfire pulls through any items dropped into the campfire.\n\nAny drops from a mob that dies in the campfire get pulled into the hopper.\n\nPlacing a campfire under a beehive or bee nest allows players to harvest honey bottles or honeycomb without provoking the bees.\n\nThere must be unobstructed air between the campfire and the beehive or bee nest.\n\nCarpets are an exception.

[Bedrock Edition only ] It can contain three levels of water.\n\nOne level of water can be added to a cauldron by using a water bottle on it.\n\nOne level of water can be removed from a cauldron, filling a water bottle, by using a glass bottle on it.\n\nA cauldron slowly fills with water when rained upon, if starting empty or with some water.\n\nThis happens randomly, at 5% of the rate in which snow accumulates on the ground during snowfall.\n\nWater can be stored in a cauldron even in the Nether.\n\nWater in a cauldron does not freeze in cold biomes.\n\nWater in a cauldron does not absorb explosion damage; make sounds and particles; absorb fall damage; [2] [3] allow Riptide tridents to activate; [4] [5] or damage endermen, striders, or blazes.\n\n[6] Cauldrons do not deal drowning damage to mobs inside of them [7] and fish act as if there is no water inside it.\n\n[8] The player cannot float or swim in it, as the water is about level with the player's waist.\n\nJumping in a cauldron does not produce any bubble or water particles.\n\nA cauldron placed below a down-facing pointed dripstone that has water placed a block above it slowly fills with water.\n\nThe same works with lava, allowing for infinite lava generation.\n\nAttempting to add lava or potion to water empties the cauldron. [Bedrock Edition only ] The water in a cauldron cannot be sucked up by a sponge, whether the sponge is touching the cauldron or not.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, leather armor is dyed through a cauldron, so a cauldron can hold dyed water.\n\nUsing a dye on a cauldron filled with water colors the water, consuming the dye.\n\nDifferent dyes may be added to produce mixed colors.\n\nUsing leather armor, leather horse armor, or wolf armor on the cauldron dyes that item the color of the water, reducing the water in the cauldron by one level for each item dyed.\n\nAttempting to add water, lava or potion to dyed water empties the cauldron.\n\nCauldron filled with lava Cauldrons can be used to hold lava.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, when a cauldron is already filled with water, it empties the cauldron and makes an extinguishing sound.\n\nA cauldron filled with lava emits a light level of 15, similar to lava, and burns any entity inside of it; in Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, this includes mobs that do not take damage from lava like zombified piglins.\n\nLava inside a cauldron does not interact with water outside of the cauldron.\n\nThe lava disappears upon putting water in the cauldron.\n\nA redstone comparator with a lava cauldron behind it outputs redstone signal strength of 3.\n\n[9] [10] A cauldron placed below a down-facing pointed dripstone that has lava placed a block above it slowly fills with lava.\n\nIf a cauldron is filled by lava, using glass bottles on the cauldron does nothing.\n\nPowder snow is currently the only solid material that can be stored in a cauldron.\n\nA cauldron slowly fills with powder snow during snowfall, if starting empty or with any layer of powder snow already inside.\n\nUp to three layers can be filled.\n\nWhen the cauldron is full, interacting using a bucket, creates a powder snow bucket and empties the cauldron.\n\nEntities standing in the cauldron do not take freeze damage, and entities wearing leather boots still fall through the powder snow.\n\nA redstone comparator with a powder snow cauldron behind it outputs a redstone signal strength proportional to the fill level, up to 3.\n\nContrary to a cauldron filled with water, a powder snow cauldron that is not full cannot be filled up with a powder snow bucket, as using the bucket on the cauldron instead places powder snow against it.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a cauldron can hold normal potions, splash potions and lingering potions.\n\nUsing a potion on a cauldron empties the potion and increases the level of the potion in the cauldron by one level.\n\nA glass bottle can then be used on a cauldron with a potion in it, filling the bottle with that potion.\n\nThis reduces the potion in the cauldron by one level.\n\nUsing an arrow on a cauldron that contains a potion transforms the arrow into a tipped arrow with that potion effect, and reduce the potion in the cauldron by one level.\n\nTipping multiple arrows at once can be more efficient, and it may use more than one level at once.\n\n1 level of potion tips up to 16 arrows, 2 levels up to 32, and a full cauldron can tip a full stack of arrows, resulting in 21.33 tipped arrows per potion.\n\nAttempting to put water, lava or a different potion into a cauldron with a potion causes an explosion sound, and the cauldron is emptied.\n\nAn entity that stands in a cauldron filled to any level with any potion does not receive the effect of the potion.\n\nUsing an empty bucket on a cauldron filled with any potion does nothing, as the bucket remains empty and the potion in the cauldron does not empty.\n\nA cauldron with water can wash the dye off of leather armor and shulker boxes, and can remove the top-most pattern layer of a banner, by pressing use on the cauldron with the leather armor, shulker box, or banner in hand.\n\nEach wash reduces the water in the cauldron by one level.\n\nThe water does not become dyed while removing dye from objects.\n\nIf a village has a cauldron that has not been claimed by a villager, any villager that does not already have a profession or job site block may change their profession to leatherworker.\n\nA cauldron with water or powder snow extinguishes entities on fire that fall into it and the entity emits black particles.\n\nThis includes mobs, players, items (if they land in the cauldron before burning up), and flaming arrows  [JE only ].\n\nFlaming arrows stuck into the side are also extinguished.\n\nEntities must reach the water or powder snow in it.\n\nEach entity extinguished causes the substance in the cauldron to decrease by one level.\n\nIf the cauldron is filled with powder snow, it then becomes a water cauldron.\n\nAn example of a cauldron used in a redstone circuit.\n\nSee also: Redstone circuit A cauldron can act as a power source for a redstone comparator.\n\nWith a cauldron behind it (either directly, or separated by an unpowered solid block), a comparator outputs a signal strength proportional to how full the cauldron is: 0 for empty, 1 for one-third full, 2 for two-thirds full, and 3 for completely full or filled with lava.\n\nHowever, if there is a block between the cauldron and the comparator, the comparator does not immediately update.\n\nJava

[Java Edition only ] If the firework rocket has no explosion effect, it deals no damage.\n\nThe explosion of a firework rocket deals 5 to 6 points of damage, with one firework star.\n\nThe explosion has a radius of roughly 4 blocks, which is unaffected by the firework star's effect.\n\nEach additional firework star on the rocket deals an additional 1 to 2 points of damage, for a maximum of 11 \u00d7 5.5 to 18 \u00d7 9 with 7 firework stars.\n\nThe flight duration of the firework increases the maximum range the firework can travel before exploding, but does not affect the damage output.\n\nLikewise, the damage remains the same regardless of any dyes used.\n\nUnlike an arrow shot from a bow, the firework does not slow down under water.\n\nFireworks crafted without firework stars shot from crossbows upon contact with terrains, slide on them.\n\nThey continue their original trajectories as soon as they break contact from the blocks they slid on.\n\nCrossbows can be repaired in an anvil or grindstone by combining two crossbows.\n\nAny loaded ammunition is retained from the crossbow in the first slot but sacrificed from the crossbow in the second slot.\n\nMultishot and Piercing are mutually exclusive.\n\nNormal methods of enchanting allow only one of them to be applied to a crossbow.\n\nCrossbows have a base enchantability of 1.\n\nEnchantments specific to crossbows include Quick Charge, Multishot and Piercing.\n\nCrossbows can be used as fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per crossbow.\n\nJava Edition: \u2191 quick1_3 occurs at half the frequency as the other sounds \u2191 0.325 for all except quick1_1 (pitch=0.9), which is 0.25 \u2191 quick1_1 can be 1.0 or 0.9; quick1_2 can be 1.0 or 0.95; quick1_3 can be 1.0 \u2191 a b _1 occurs at 2 \u2044 3 the frequency as the other sounds \u2191 a b 0.325 for all except _1 (pitch=0.95), which is 0.25 \u2191 a b _1 can be 1.0 or 0.95; _2 can be 1.0, 0.95, or 1.05; _3 can be 1.0, 0.9, or 1.05 \u2191 loading_middle4 occurs at 1 \u2044 4 the frequency as the other sounds \u2191 loading_middle1 can be 1.0, 0.95, or 1.2; loading_middle2 and loading_middle3 can be 1.0, 0.9, or 1.05; loading_middle4 can be 1.0 \u2191 a b MC-203146 \u2191 Multiplied by the loading percentage of the crossbow Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Main article: Player.dat format tag: The tag tag.\n\nChargedProjectiles: The items this crossbow has charged, normally one entry (three if enchanted with multishot): A charged item.\n\nTags common to all items Charged: If the crossbow is charged.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Item format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Crossbow\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nAlongside pillagers, crossbows were inspired by Minecraft Dungeons, even though they were added in the base game first.\n\n[2] Crossbows enchanted with Quick Charge VI and above get stuck on the first frame on the recharging animation because the resulting charge time is negative, and the game never reaches the time markers that tell it to advance the animation or the reloading procedure itself.\n\nIt is technically possible to charge such crossbows, but this would require overflowing the value that determines how long the crossbow has been charged.\n\nThis takes such an amount of time that this is practically impossible: for example, charging a crossbow with Quick Charge VI would take 69.4 years to complete.\n\nAlthough Piercing allows arrows to bypass shields, they can't get through the wither armor.\n\nThe crossbow's first-person loading animation in Bedrock Edition is different from Java Edition.\n\nEven if a crossbow is already wound with a projectile, when it drops on the ground, it always looks uncharged.\n\n[3] In real life, crossbows don't shoot the same arrows as bows, rather they shoot shorter, thicker, and oftentimes fletchless arrows (usually called \"bolts\") made to withstand the crossbow's increased power, which can shatter conventional arrows.\n\nA crossbow shown at MINECON Earth 2018.\n\nA pillager armed with a crossbow, shown at MINECON Earth 2018.\n\nHow the crossbow is equipped.\n\nAn enchanted crossbow.\n\nSteve charging crossbow in Java Edition.\n\nAlex charging crossbow in Java Edition.\n\nPillager charging crossbow.\n\nPiglin charging crossbow.\n\nThe Minecraft Dungeons variant of the crossbow \u2191 MC-111738 \u2191 \"March 2021 developper Q&A\" \u2013 discord.com, March 11, 2021.\n\n\u2191 MC-137552 Taking Inventory: Crossbow \u2013 Minecraft.net on October 20, 2022 Items View at: Template:Items/content [edit ]",

can be broken by all variants of zombies (except drowned) and vindicators in Hard difficulty.\n\nIron doors can be opened only with redstone power.\n\nDoors must be \"attached\" to a block beneath them.\n\nTo place a door, use a door item while pointing at the top of the block it should be attached to.\n\nA door can be attached to: the top of any full solid opaque block (stone, dirt, blocks of gold, etc.) the top of an upside-down slab or upside-down stairs the top of a slime block or downward-facing piston More information about placement on transparent blocks can be found at Opacity/Placement.\n\nWhen placed, a door occupies the side of the block facing the player, or behind a player if placed in the player's own space.\n\nBy default, a door's \"hinge\" appears on the side of the half of the block that the player pointed at when placing and its \"handle\" on the opposite side [Java Edition only ], but the hinge is forced to other side by: Placing a door besides another door (creating a double door where both doors open away from each other) Placing a door between a full solid and any opaque block (top or bottom), making the hinge appear to attach to the

other methods either, except throwing them into lava).\n\nMobs can spawn in a space occupied by a door.\n\nThe sound of opening and closing of a door can be heard up to 16 blocks away, like most mob sounds.\n\nWhen placed using the / setblock command, only one half of a door is placed, because doors are actually two separate blocks.\n\nThe lower half still works, but with graphical bugs, and the upper half does not.\n\nRedstone cannot be used because it updates the half, breaking it.\n\nThe upper half does not drop anything when broken, the lower half drops a normal door.\n\nThis implies that the upper half is dependent on the lower.\n\nA door can be used as a switchable barrier to entity movement.\n\nAlthough primarily used to block movement by mobs and players, a door can also be used to control the movement of boats (for example, a door placed in a two-wide water flow stops a boat when perpendicular to the flow, but allow it to move again when parallel), items and minecarts (a door can stop a falling item or minecart, then allow it to drop again when the door moves), etc.\n\nIn Java Edition, doors provide a breathable space if placed underwater.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, doors in water source blocks are waterlogged and do not displace water source blocks.\n\nDoors are 0.1875 (3 \u2044 16) blocks thick (0.1825 in Bedrock Edition).\n\nThe rest of a door's space can be moved through freely.\n\nA door occupies two block spaces and both halves normally act as a single barrier, although doors can be opened or closed with a player or mob occupying the bottom block of the door, [1] in which case the player can jump up to land on the bottom half of the door and then again to land on top of the door.\n\nTo open or close a wooden door, use the Use Item/Place Block control.\n\nWhen a door opens or closes, it immediately changes its orientation without affecting anything in the space it \"swings through\".\n\nMoving doors do not push entities the way that pistons do.\n\nVillagers, wandering traders, [BE only ] vindicators  [JE only ], piglins and piglin brutes can open and close wooden doors when pathfinding.\n\nSome zombies can break wooden doors in Hard difficulty.\n\nZombies have a 5% chance to spawn with the ability to break doors.\n\nVindicators spawned from a raid in Normal and Hard difficulty can also break wooden doors, but they do so only to

[Bedrock Edition only ] Players can dye wool by placing wool and any dye in a crafting grid.\n\nDyes can be used on sheep to change the color of the wool.\n\nShearing a colored sheep drops the corresponding color of the wool, and the sheep retains the color when the wool regenerates.\n\nBreeding colored sheep produces a lamb colored as one of the parent sheep, or a color resulting from the combination of both parents' color.\n\nThe color combining follows the same rules that dyes use \u2013 red and yellow sheep produce an orange lamb, but a blue and yellow sheep cannot create a green lamb.\n\nThe unlimited reproduction of colored sheep makes dyeing and shearing sheep infinitely more efficient than just dyeing wool directly.\n\nDye can also be used on a tamed wolf or cat to change the color of its collar from the default red to the color of the dye.\n\nCarpets can be dyed.\n\nTerracotta can be dyed by placing 8 blocks around a dye on a crafting table.\n\nDyes can also be used to craft concrete powder, which can then be set into their respective concrete blocks (they cannot be dyed directly).\n\nStained glass can be stained by placing 8 blocks of glass around a dye on a crafting table.\n\nJust like regular glass, stained glass can be crafted into stained glass panes.\n\nThe recipe for this is the same as with regular glass.\n\nShulker boxes are generated in a light shade of purple (like the purpur block), but can be dyed any color.\n\nThey can also be re-dyed as often as desired.\n\nPlayers can dye beds by placing a bed and any color dye in a crafting grid.\n\nPlayers can dye candles by placing an undyed candle and any color dye in a crafting grid.\n\nMain article: Banner \u00a7 Patterns Dyes are used in most banner patterns to determine the pattern and color displayed.\n\nA graph showing all combinations of two dyes on a tunic.\n\nLeather armor and wolf armor can be dyed by: Crafting dyes with a piece of leather armor, leather horse armor, or wolf armor. [Java Edition only ] Dousing the leather armor, leather horse armor, or wolf armor in a cauldron to which dyes have been added. [Bedrock Edition only ] There are 5,713,438 [1] (34.1% of sRGB) colors leather armor and wolf armor can be, as it is possible to put more than one dye on the crafting table alongside the leather armor and the wolf armor.\n\nArmor can be dyed multiple times with previous colors affecting the final outcome.\n\nColored armor can be reverted to their original color using a cauldron with undyed water.\n\nThe game has a specific formula for calculating the color of dyed armor: each color, in the RGB color model, has a red value, green value, and blue value.\n\nFor each dye in the crafting grid, and the armor itself (if it is already dyed), the red, green, and blue values are added to running totals.\n\nIn addition, a running total of the highest value (be it red, green, or blue) is also kept.\n\nAfter this, each total is divided by the number of colors used.\n\nThis effectively produces the average red, green, blue, and maximum values.\n\nThe maximum value of the average RGB values is also calculated.\n\nFinally, each average RGB value is multiplied by the average maximum value and divided by the maximum of the average RGB values.\n\nThe modified average RGB values are then used as the final color.\n\nThis procedure can be summed up with the following equations: for each color (all \"total\" variables start at 0 before counting): totalRed = totalRed + redValue totalGreen = totalGreen + greenValue totalBlue = totalBlue + blueValue totalMaximum = totalMaximum + max(redValue, greenValue, blueValue) numberOfColors = numberOfColors + 1 averageRed = totalRed / numberOfColors averageGreen = totalGreen / numberOfColors averageBlue = totalBlue / numberOfColors averageMaximum = totalMaximum / numberOfColors maximumOfAverage = max(averageRed, averageGreen, averageBlue) gainFactor = averageMaximum / maximumOfAverage resultRed = averageRed * gainFactor resultGreen = averageGreen * gainFactor resultBlue = averageBlue * gainFactor Due to the way this formula works, the resulting color can never be darker than the average of the input colors and is often lighter and more saturated.\n\nOf course, the resulting color can never be lighter or more saturated than the lightest or most saturated input color.\n\nIn addition, this formula never creates an RGB value higher than 255 (which would be invalid in the 8-bit RGB color model).\n\nIf leather armor or wolf armor is renamed on an anvil, it retains its name when dyed or undyed.\n\nMixing Samples + = #FED83D + + = #C898BE + + = #B56D51 A firework star can have a single color or a combination of up to eight colors when crafted with dyes.\n\nAdding one or more dyes to a crafted firework star adds a \"fade to color\" effect to it, overwriting any existing fade colors.\n\nDye can be used to craft balloons. [Minecraft Education only ] Dye can also be used to craft glow sticks. [Minecraft Education only ] Water can be dyed in a cauldron by holding any dye in the hand and pressing use on a cauldron filled with water.

[Bedrock Edition only ] Elytra have a minimum speed of about 7.2 m/s (obtained by gliding at the altitude cap with a strong upward pitch of 30\u00b0).\n\nIf the diver drops to 0 speed, they quickly get accelerated back up to at least this minimum.\n\nThe diver can increase speed by choosing to descend faster, but afterward, they do not regain nearly as much altitude.\n\nIn the real world, drag increases with speed, and drag, in turn, slows the aircraft; Minecraft mimics this.\n\nTo glide from cliff to cliff, a player's best bet is to aim slightly above the horizon.\n\nSharp turns are a fast way to lose speed.\n\nQuicker turns cause greater losses, while gentle movements have small effects.\n\nMaking a hairpin turn can actually be used for making high-speed landings safe as well as for precise landings on small targets like rooftops.\n\nThe player aims to glide just above the target, then as they're right over it they immediately reverse directions, then they make readjustments as necessary.\n\nThe lowest rate of altitude loss is about 1.5 m/sec, obtained by gliding at the altitude cap with a slight upward pitch (12\u00b0 or 15\u00b0).\n\nTo get the best possible glide ratio (and thus the furthest distance out of their altitude), the diver pilot should aim directly at the horizon.\n\nThis ratio is about 9.47 to 1.\n\nSlow Falling potions greatly decrease the player's vertical (fall) speed, which also greatly decreases their horizontal speed (clearly, it depends on the vertical fall rate, as one might expect from flight modeling).\n\nThe net result is that the player flies extremely slowly - but their elytra still takes durability damage at the usual rate (1 durability per second without Unbreaking, etc.).\n\nDue to this combination, elytra plus Slow Falling is largely a novelty that most players won't use.\n\nThe Feather Falling enchantment does not affect elytra speed and does not reduce fall damage from hitting things with elytra.\n\nIt is possible to calculate the glide range by dividing the altitude by tan of the glide angle (altitude/tan(glide angle)).\n\nFor example, if the player glides from an altitude of 64 blocks above ground with a glide angle of 15 degrees, they can glide for 237 blocks (assume that they are on superflat), since floor(64 / tan(15\u00b0)) is 237.\n\nTrying for too high a pitch reduces the player's lift.\n\nAt a pitch of 30\u00b0 above the horizon, the player has the lowest possible airspeed of 7.2 m/sec.\n\nAbove that, the player might be considered to be in a stall.\n\nIncreasing the pitch gets closer to a free-fall, and stalled flight at 60\u00b0 is enough to cause fall damage.\n\nStalling at 90\u00b0 is a true free-fall.\n\nRecovering from a stall is done by readjusting to any safe pitch as quickly as the player likes.\n\nThis can be just changing to look at the horizon.\n\nFirework rockets are used for speed boosts while gliding.\n\nFirework rockets can be used for propulsion during flight by placing it in either hand and using.\n\nUsing a firework rocket while gliding quickly maximizes the player's speed for a time similar to the rocket's flight duration.\n\nIf the rocket is equipped with firework stars, it explodes at the end of its flight, inflicting damage based on the number of stars.\n\nIt is possible to gain altitude during powered flight.\n\nThis makes it possible to glide for extreme distances and had been used extensively by Far Lands / world border challenges.\n\nA broken pair of elytra.\n\nDurability decreases by one point each second when gliding.\n\nA pair of elytra has 432 durability, allowing 7 minutes and 12 seconds of gliding time without enchantments, providing more than 10,000 blocks of transport distance.\n\nIt is possible to apply the Unbreaking enchantment using an anvil and an enchanted book, which affects the elytra, in the same way it does to tools.\n\nUnbreaking III increases elytra's flight time to about four seconds per durability point, a total of 28 minutes and 44 seconds.\n\nWhen the durability reaches 1, elytra stop working until they are repaired, adopting a tattered texture in the inventory.\n\nThe damage ends at durability 1, so they can never fully break.\n\nA pair may be repaired by either using the Mending enchantment, combining two pairs in a grindstone, or combining it in an anvil with phantom membranes.\n\nIn an anvil, each piece of membrane repairs elytra by 108 durability points, requiring 4 pieces to fully repair them.\n\nEach repair on the anvil will also increase the prior work penalty for the Elytra, making every subsequent repair increasingly expensive, with an upper limit where repairs are no longer allowed because they are \"too expensive\".\n\nHowever, the prior work penalty can be reset to 0 for an enchanted elytra pair when it is disenchanted on a grindstone (by adding nothing to it).\n\nUnenchanted elytra cannot be used on the grindstone alone.\n\nElytra can receive the following enchantments by combining in an anvil: Java Edition: \u2191 Is a quarter of the player's velocity.\n\nIf flying for less than 1 second, it is 0.0; otherwise, if flying for less than 2 seconds, it is between 0.0 and a quarter of the player's velocity (scaling up with time until 2 seconds) \u2191 If the volume is greater than 0.8, 0.8-volume is added to the pitch \u2191 a b MC-177084 Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Issues relating to \"Elytra\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nIn reality, elytra are not used for flight.\n\nThey are the tough forewings of beetles and earwigs that cover the wings they actually use for flight.\n\nHowever, like Minecraft elytra, beetles can use them for gliding.\n\nThe singular form of elytra is an elytron.\n\nMany people say it like https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:ElytraWrong.wav /\u02c8i la\u026a tr\u0259/ ee-LYE-tr\u0259, LYE like the drain cleaner, or https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:ElytraPronunciation.mp3 /\u02c8\u0259 li\u02d0 tr\u0259/ ee-LEE-tr\u0259, LEE as in \"leech\" or \"leave\".\n\nThey also treat \"elytra\" as a singular noun, saying \"AN e\"lye\"tra\", or \"two E\"lye\"tras\", with the \"an\" article, or the \"-s\" ending, which is incorrect, as \"elytra\" is a plural word, and is the plural of \"elytron\".\n\nFor the correct grammar, think of how you would use the word \"wings\" in a sentence and replace it with elytra.\n\nFor example: \"I need to find some wings\" -> \"I need to find some elytra\", not \"AN elytra\" as you wouldn't say \"an wings\" or \"an apples\".\n\nA flying player has a shorter hitbox than usual: A 0.6 block cube centered on the player's feet.\n\nIt is possible to glide while on a ladder, by pressing \u21e7 Shift followed by space, causing the player to fall with a speed determined by the player's visual angle.\n\nThis means that the player can descend fast on a ladder, but if the speed is too fast when hitting the ground, they can take fatal fall damage.\n\nUsing a firework rocket can also speed up the player's descent.\n\nIn Java Edition if the player glides into deep water with elytra equipped, the animation does not stop, giving it the appearance of a swimming animation.\n\n[3] The animation stops once the player touches the ground.\n\nAdditionally, firework rockets can be used with elytra underwater with a short boost duration.\n\nElytra do not deactivate when the player flies into lava.\n\n[3] Elytra can be equipped onto some mobs using commands.\n\nThis has no effect unless the mob has the FallFlying tag set to 1b.\n\nMobs glide forward, unable to control the movement before landing, at which time they regain their AI.\n\nExceptions to this are squids as the squid's AI causes it to attempt swimming in midair, making it fall straight down because it conflicts with the elytra mechanics.\n\nBecause chickens fall slowly, they can move more distance.\n\nEndermen, tamed wolves and tamed cats that are not sitting cannot teleport until they hit the ground.\n\nBecause mobs do not regain control until they hit the ground, vexes fall until they die or despawn as they cannot touch the ground.\n\nMobs capable of flying, such as parrots or vexes can steer in air, though they cannot travel up or down.\n\nDolphins also have this ability.\n\n4J Studios created an elytron-centered tutorial map for console edition when elytra were first introduced to this platform, this map is themed as \"ruins of an ancient civilization of Minecraft worshipers\" and showcases the new amplified terrain generation.\n\nThis map can be seen behind the scenes.\n\n[4] On 28 March 2017, 4J Studios added an elytron-themed Mini Games for console edition called \"Glide;\" it consists of Time Attack and Score Attack mode.\n\n[5] [6] A player who jumps with both elytra and the Slow Falling effect travels slightly upward, which is a cheap but time-consuming alternative to fireworks and Riptide -enchanted tridents.\n\nOn May 5, 2019, Mojang tweeted ' The End never yields enough adequate resources, sadly,' along with a sad emoji.\n\n[7] The

intentional decision of game balancing.\n\n[9] The first image of elytra, tweeted by Jeb.\n\nClick to play.\n\nFolded elytra, which resembles the cape the user is wearing.\n\nThe minecon 2015 cape

[until JE 1.21.2 ] If the player throws an ender pearl in Survival mode and changes to Creative mode before the pearl lands, the player is still teleported.\n\nThe player is still teleported by throwing an ender pearl and entering the Nether before it lands.\n\nThe pearl is not lost if an ender pearl is thrown into a nether portal and the player travels through the portal; the pearl lands and teleports the player as usual.\n\nIf multiple ender pearls are thrown in succession, the player can be hurt only once from fall damage within about a one-second span.\n\nIf a player dies from ender pearl teleportation, the death message says: \"<player> hit the ground too hard\".\n\nA thrown ender pearl faces toward the player in first-person view, while it appears rotated horizontal in third-person view.\n\nThis is the case for all throwable items (ender pearl, egg, snowball, and all throwable potions).\n\nEnder pearls and snowballs have the exact same range when fired.\n\nTherefore, snowballs can be used to predict the trajectory of ender pearls, or simply for practicing ender pearl throwing.\n\nThis can be very helpful when the player has to throw ender pearls in dangerous environments, such as the Nether or the End.\n\nDespite the fact that ender pearls deal no damage to anything they're thrown at, provokable mobs (such as iron golems and piglins) will be provoked by the player if one is thrown at them.\n\nThe original suggestion image for teleporting with ender pearls.\n\nEnder pearls were formerly found in water, however endermen now teleport out to prevent damage.\n\n\u2191 MC-88236 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/kpsay/eggsnowballender_pearl_suggestiongif/c2mabfj \u2191 https://twitter.com/notch/status/118614580539826176 \u2191 http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/kss7n/twitter_ender_pearls_have_a_unique_ability_now/c2mwldd \u2191 MC-125758 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 MC-73884 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 MC-2164 \u2191 https://youtu.be/KA1UmxraeUg End Dimension Ender Dragon Ender Portal Enderman Items View at: Template:Items/content [edit ] Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

also its Decorations list includes an entry for its target monument, mansion or buried treasure.\n\nIts map item entry is identical to that of a normal map, except that by the time the player sees it, its colors byte array is pre-filled with explorer maps' characteristic land-water boundary lines and water shading.\n\nIt should be noted that this additional data is stored in the Cartographer's NBT data and in the inventory item's NBT data, and not in the map file (e.g.\n\nmap_0.dat).\n\nIf the player were to use the / give command to give themselves a map with the same map ID as an existing explorer map, it would still have the Ocean Monument or the Woodland Mansion icon on the map, but it would simply be named \"Map\" instead of, for example, \"Ocean Explorer Map\".\n\nItem data tag: display: How the map looks in an item slot.\n\nSee also Player.dat_format#Display Properties.\n\nName: The name the map is given.\n\nIn this case, they are localized strings: either {\"translate\":\"filled_map.monument\"}, {\"translate\":\"filled_map.mansion\"}, {\"translate\":\"filled_map.buried_treasure\"}, or {\"translate\":\"filled_map.trial_chambers\"} [verify ].\n\nMapColor: Color codes are calculated from the Red, Green and Blue components using this formula: Red << 16 + Green <<8 + Blue.\n\n[note 1] Monument maps use 3830373, which is rgb(58,114,101).\n\nMansion maps use 5393476, which is rgb(82,76,68).\n\nBuried treasure explorer maps do not use a color code.\n\nDecorations:: One of these for each icon on the map.\n\nExplorer maps always have at least one representing their target.\n\nid: An arbitrary unique string identifying the decoration.\n\nFor explorer map target structures, this is \"+\".\n\nrot: The rotation of the icon.\n\nFor explorer map target structures, this is always 180.\n\ntype: The ID of the map icon: 8 for a mansion map, 9 for a monument map, 26 for a treasure map.\n\nx: The world x-coordinate of the target structure icon.\n\nz: The world z-coordinate of the target structure icon.\n\nNotes \u2191 For positive values larger than 0x00FFFFFF, the top byte is ignored.\n\nAll negative values produce white.\n\nIssues relating to \"Explorer Map\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nWhen a cartographer generates the trade offers for the explorer maps, it chooses the location of one of the nearest structures of the respective type (monument or woodland mansion).\n\nFor the reason above, explorer maps obtained from one cartographer are always the same.\n\nAlso, if two cartographers unlock the explorer map trades approximately at the same place and at the same time, the map locations are usually identical.\n\nThis sometimes also happens when finding multiple treasure maps from ocean ruins.\n\nExplorer maps fill as the chunks are generated, rather than when the player holds them while in the area; leaving an explorer map while exploring the area still fills the map.\n\nBuried treasure explorer maps are named Buried Treasure Map in Java Edition while in Bedrock Edition, they are named Treasure Map.\n\nIt is possible for a cartographer to give a monument or woodland mansion explorer map for areas where the structures would have spawned in the world, but were unable to as a result of terrain generation.\n\nAs a result, explorer maps, unfortunately, don't always guarantee that a structure exists at the purported location.\n\nThis is most common with woodland mansion explorer maps, due to its generation algorithm.\n\nOn Bedrock Edition, inventory editors and add-ons can be used to create Explorer Maps that lead to any structure.\n\nAn ocean explorer map in the off-hand, a woodland explorer map in the main hand, and a cartographer villager in between them.\n\nA partially-explored explorer map.\n\nTwo fully-explored maps of the same place, one of which is a woodland explorer map.\n\nAn item frame holding a buried treasure explorer map.\n\nThe player can see the red X on the left side of the map.\n\nPurchasing explorer maps from a cartographer.\n\nMap Woodland Mansion Ocean Monument Shipwreck Buried treasure \u2191 Specifically, biomes in the \"water_on_map_outlines\" biome tag.\n\n\u2191 \"The Discovery Update: on Pocket and Win 10 soon\" \u2013 Minecraft.net, March 29, 2017 Taking Inventory: Explorer Map \u2013 Minecraft.net on November 13, 2019 Items View at: Template:Items/content [edit ]",

[Java Edition only ]) When spawned, fireworks have a vertical speed of.05 and a random small X and Z speed (random value near zero with a standard deviation of.001).\n\nEach firework also determines its lifetime in ticks by 10 \u00d7 (number of gunpowder + 1) + random value from 0 to 5 + random value from 0 to 6, after which it explodes.\n\nEach tick, the firework accelerates horizontally by multiplying its X and Z velocities by 1.15, and vertically by adding a constant factor of.04.\n\nFireworks can be made to travel different directions by being dispensed or launched under flowing water.\n\nThe firework's direction combines with the flow of the water to go diagonally.\n\nFirework rockets without firework stars shot from a crossbow upon hitting terrain elements will traverse along until stopped by a ledge or into unobstructed terrains again continuing its original flight path.\n\nLedges as tall as one pixel high (e.g.\n\nfrom dirt paths to grass blocks) will also block the firework.\n\nThey will still vanish if they hit entities early amidst their flight.\n\nAfter successfully defending a village from a Raid the villagers may celebrate by setting off firework rockets.\n\nFireworks can be used to boost elytra when in flight.\n\nNormally, elytra can glide for a short distance, but with the use of fireworks, the player can fly a long distance, gain speed, and take off from the ground.\n\nSimply using the firework rocket with elytra spread boosts the player in the direction the player faces.\n\nIt can leave behind a trail sometimes.\n\nAlthough fireworks with firework stars can be used, the player takes blast damage if they use it in flight.\n\nThere are four types of rockets, with three types of flight duration.\n\nHigher flight durations mean longer boosts.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the fireworks obtained from the Creative menu have a flight duration of 1, while in Java Edition, the fireworks obtained in the Creative menu have a flight duration of 1, 2, or 3.\n\nJava Edition: Firework rockets use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Main article: Player.dat format tag: The item's tag tag.\n\nFireworks: One of these may appear on a firework rocket.\n\nExplosions: List of compounds representing each explosion this firework causes.: A firework explosion.\n\nTags common to all firework explosion effects Flight: Indicates the flight duration of the firework (equals the amount of gunpowder used in crafting the rocket).\n\nCan be anything from -128 to 127.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Item format.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all projectiles FireworksItem: The crafted firework rocket.\n\nCount: The item count, typically 1.\n\nid: The id of the item, should be minecraft:firework_rocket.\n\ntag: The tag tag.\n\nFireworks: One of these may appear on a firework rocket.\n\nExplosions: List of compounds representing each explosion this firework causes.: A firework explosion.\n\nTags common to all firework explosion effects Flight: Indicates the flight duration of the firework (equals the amount of gunpowder used in crafting the rocket).\n\nCan be anything from -128 to 127.\n\nLife: The number of ticks this fireworks rocket has been flying for.\n\nLifeTime: The number of ticks before this fireworks rocket explodes.\n\nThis value is randomized when the firework is launched: ((Flight + 1) * 10 + random(0 to 5) + random(0 to 6)) ShotAtAngle: 1 or 0 (true/false) -

    "content": "For food in Minecraft Dungeons, see MCD:Food.\n\nFood refers to any consumable items that, when eaten, restore hunger points and hunger saturation points, and sometimes cause status effects.\n\nThey are essential to survival, as going without them eventually causes the player to starve, causing damage until reaching 10 in Easy difficulty, and 1 on Normal.\n\nStarvation damage kills the player in Hard and Hardcore Mode.\n\nFood is eaten by holding use while having the food item selected in the hot bar or in the off-hand.\n\nCake cannot be eaten this way, and must instead be placed on a surface before being eaten.\n\nWith the exception of chorus fruit, golden apples, enchanted golden apples, honey bottles, milk, and suspicious stew  [Java Edition only ], food cannot be eaten when the hunger bar is completely full.\n\nIn Creative Mode, any food can be consumed at any time.\n\nAll food items and ingredients can be stacked in the inventory slots, except for milk, rabbit stew, mushroom stew, beetroot soup, suspicious stew, and cake. [Java Edition only ] This page covers food items for players; blocks and items that can be eaten by other mobs are not included here.\n\nMain article: Hunger \u00a7 Mechanics See also: Tutorials/Hunger_management Raw (left) and cooked (right) chicken.\n\nEating raw chicken can give the player food poisoning.\n\nPlayers have two different food statistics, one of which is visible: The hunger level is visible, and the saturation level is not.\n\nSaturation is the first statistic to decrease when a player performs energy-intensive actions, and it must be completely depleted before the visible hunger meter begins decreasing.\n\nAlthough the current saturation level is generally hidden, the player can tell that their saturation level is completely depleted if the visible hunger meter begins displaying a jittering effect.\n\nEating a food item replenishes a fixed number of hunger points and saturation points, based on the item.\n\nSome foods have a better ratio of saturation to hunger points replenished than others.\n\nOvereating the hunger bar does not overflow to saturation.\n\nA player's current saturation level can never exceed their current hunger level.\n\nA player at a hunger level of 5, for example, can be at a maximum of 5 saturation.\n\nFood always restores hunger (raising the saturation limit) before supplying saturation.\n\nThe most efficient use of food is to eat low-saturation food to fill the hunger bar, followed by high-saturation food to fill saturation.\n\nWhile a few hunger points may be wasted when eating nourishing food when nearly full, eating nourishing foods on a low hunger bar wastes even more points of saturation.\n\nMaximizing saturation increases the length of time (and/or the amount of damage healed) before the player needs to eat again.\n\nMost foods can be eaten by holding down the right-click button with a food item in hand.\n\nIt takes 1.61 seconds to eat most foods; dried kelp takes 0.865 seconds to eat.\n\nAdditionally, a player can hold food in their offhand in Java Edition.\n\nWhile eating, food particles form from the player's mouth correlated with their respective food item, and produces a munching noise.\n\nEating also slows the user significantly.\n\nUnlike other foods, cake has to be eaten by placing it, then right-clicking on its block form.\n\nEating cake is instant and it has 7 edible slices, each giving 2 () hunger and 0.4 hunger saturation.\n\nNourishment is defined as the ratio of saturation to hunger points restored.\n\nFoods with higher nourishment values should be eaten when the hunger bar is more full.\n\nThe \"nourishment\" table below can help by categorizing foods by their saturation-to-hunger restoration ratios.\n\nSee the more detailed Foods table for the exact hunger and saturation statistics of each food.\n\n\u2191 a b  [Java Edition only ] \u2191 a b  [Bedrock Edition only ] \u2191 Food Points + Saturation, which gives roughly how long the food can last.\n\nSee hunger for details.\n\nThis value is reduced if the player is near the food or saturation cap, as excess points of either type are wasted.\n\n\u2191 a b c Average expected food quality if food poisoning isn't cured.\n\nFood poisoning lasts 30 seconds from the last food that inflicted it, and drains nearly 2 shanks of hunger over that duration.\n\nThe loss comes from saturation before visible hunger.\n\n\u2191 Food quality if poison isn't cured; healing the damage from poison quickly drains the hunger bar.\n\nThe following items cannot be eaten on their own.\n\nInstead, they are used to craft consumable food items.\n\nJava Edition: \u2191 Can be 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 Bedrock Edition: Items View at: Template:Items/content [edit ]",

    "content": "Head Skeleton Wither Skeleton Player Zombie Creeper Dragon Piglin Rarity color Uncommon Renewable Skeleton, Wither Skeleton, Zombie, Creeper, Piglin: Yes Dragon, Player: No Stackable Yes (64) Tool Any tool Blast resistance 1 Hardness 1 Luminous No Transparent Yes Flammable No Catches fire from lava No A head or skull is a block modeled after the head of a specific entity.\n\nThere are seven types of heads: player (Steve 's head by default), zombie, skeleton, wither skeleton, creeper, piglin, and dragon.\n\nA mob head can be mined using any item, [1] and drops itself when broken.\n\nIf a head is pushed by a piston or comes in contact with water or lava, it breaks off as an item.\n\nWhen destroyed by an explosion, the head always drops as an item.\n\nDragon heads generate on end ships found in end cities.\n\nSkeleton skulls can generate in ancient cities, which sometimes generate in the deep dark.\n\nA wither skeleton has a 2.5% chance of dropping a wither skeleton skull when killed by a player or a tamed wolf.\n\nThe chance is increased by 1% per level of Looting, for a maximum of 5.5% with Looting III.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the chance is increased by 2% per level of Looting, for a maximum of 8.5% with Looting III.\n\nSkeleton, wither skeleton, zombie, creeper and piglin heads are always dropped by the respective mob if it dies due to a charged creeper 's explosion.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, if multiple mobs are killed by the same charged creeper, all of them drop their heads, however in Java Edition only one mob selected at random drops its head.\n\n[2] If an ender dragon or a player is killed by a charged creeper, it does not drop its head.\n\n[3] Mob heads can be oriented in 16 different directions on top of a block, and 4 directions on the sides of blocks, similar to signs.\n\nThey can be placed on top of, or beside each other by shift clicking.\n\nWhen placed and powered by redstone, the piglin and dragon heads plays an animation.\n\nThe piglin head flaps its ears (2 times per second for the right ear and 2.5 times per second for the left ear) while the dragon head opens and closes its mouth repeatedly (2 times per second).\n\nThe same animation occurs when worn by a (horizontally) moving player, zombie, skeleton, or armor stand (note: the animation does not play if the NoGravity tag is set to 1) See also: \u00a7 Renders The player can wear heads, similarly to pumpkins or helmets.\n\nThis overlays the second layer of the player's skin.\n\nWearing the corresponding mob head reduces the detection range for skeletons (but not wither skeletons), creepers, zombies, and piglins to 50% of the normal range.\n\nThis is similar to (and stacks with) the reductions in detection range from sneaking and from the Invisibility status effect.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, wearing any mob head or carved pumpkin makes the player invisible to other players on a locator map.\n\nWither build configuration Withers can be spawned by placing soul sand or soul soil in a T shape, and putting 3 wither skeleton skulls on top of the T.\n\nThe T can be horizontal or vertical.\n\nThe last block placed must be one of the three wither skeleton skulls.\n\nA dispenser can also create a wither, by placing the final skull onto soul sand directly in front of and below it.\n\nA dispenser can equip a mob head on a player, mob, or armor stand with an empty helmet slot, within the block the dispenser is facing.\n\nDispensers can also complete the construction of a wither.\n\nMob heads can receive the following enchantments, but only through an anvil.\n\nPlacing a head above a note block causes the note block to play the corresponding mob's ambient sound when activated.\n\nThe only exception is the creeper head; as creepers don't make ambient sounds, the note block plays the primed (hissing) sound instead.\n\nThe block below the note block does not affect the mob sound it creates.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Java Edition.\n\nHuman heads have an extra usage for map makers, they can be given NBT data so that they appear with the skin of any Minecraft account.\n\nThis means if a player knows that a specific account has a head that is desired to display, the NBT data can be edited to make it appear.\n\nThe command to give the player a head with the skin of another player is / give @s minecraft:player_head{SkullOwner:\"< PlayerName >\"}.\n\nCommonly, this kind of head is called a custom head.\n\nAnother command to give the player a head with another player's skin is / give @s minecraft:player_head{SkullOwner:{Id:\"< PlayerUUID >\",Properties:{textures:[{Value:\"< SkinURL >\"}]} } }.\n\nSkinURL is a string encoded in Base64 containing the URL of the player's skin.\n\n[4] A player head saves the skin of the player from the time it was created, meaning if the player changes their skin, the head still displays the original texture.\n\n[5] Note that it is therefore necessary to be connected to the internet to load the texture of a skin, whatever the property used.\n\nWhen they are loaded for the first time by the client, the skins textures are cached in.minecraft \\assets\\skins\\(subfolders)\\(files).\n\nIf the client does not have access to the internet when it first loads, the player's head displays a regular head (Steve's skin) which is also cached.\n\nAfterwards, even if the client reconnects to the internet, in order to display the skin correctly, it is necessary to clear the cache manually by deleting the recently created files in.minecraft \\assets\\skins\\(subfolder), then restarting the game.\n\nWhen NBT-customized heads (with names and lores) are placed on the ground, they lose their names and given lores upon picking up.\n\nTherefore, using Ctrl + pick block on a custom player head gives the player a head that still retains its textures, but with no lores and its name is reset to either [PlayerName]'s Head (heads obtained by MHF-Marc's Head Format or existing players in the world) or Player Head (heads obtained by using skin URLs).\n\nMost of the MHF mob heads provided.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Java Edition.\n\nMarc Watson created a number of accounts with specific skins so map makers could use common heads without the risk of someone changing their skins.\n\n[6] Nowadays, since heads do not update the skin if a player changes their skin, this is not something map-makers need to worry about, though these skins are still useful.\n\nThese accounts have names in the format MHF_< Name >, for example MHF_PigZombie is the name of a Minecraft user with a zombified piglin head.\n\nMHF stands for \"Marc's Head Format\".\n\n[7] There are also a few blocks and \"bonus\" heads, for more variety.\n\nThese player heads have not been updated in compliance with the Texture Update, and are outdated.\n\nBecause these are names of player accounts, these heads are obtained or placed using the SkullOwner tag, for instance: / give @s minecraft:player_head{SkullOwner:\"MHF_ <Name> \"}.\n\nThe following names/heads have been made available: [8] Mobs MHF_Alex MHF_Blaze MHF_CaveSpider

[Java Edition only ] Despite not being a solid block, attached blocks such as rails, levers, tripwire and redstone dust can be placed on top of hoppers, but not on their sides.\n\nHopper GUI showing the hopper's five slots of inventory at the top and the player's inventory below.\n\nA hopper can be used as a container and has 5 slots of inventory space.\n\nTo open the hopper GUI, use the Use Item/Place Block control.\n\nTo move items between the hopper inventory and the player inventory or hotbar while the hopper GUI is open, drag or shift-click the items.\n\nTo exit the hopper GUI, use the Esc key, B button or circle button, depending on the device.\n\nBy default, the GUI of a hopper is labeled \"Item Hopper\".\n\nA hopper's GUI label can be changed by naming the hopper in an anvil before placing it, or, in Java Edition, by using the data command (for example, to label a hopper at (0,64,0) \"Steve's Hopper\", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {CustomName:'\"Steve's Hopper\"'}).\n\nIn Java Edition, a hopper's GUI can be \"locked\" (or subsequently unlocked) by setting the hopper's Lock tag with the data command.\n\nIf a hopper's Lock tag is not blank, the hopper cannot be accessed except by players holding an item with the same name as the Lock tag's text.\n\nFor example, to lock a hopper at (0,64,0) so that only players holding an item named \"Steve's Key\" can access the hopper, use /data merge block 0 64 0 {Lock:\"Steve's Key\"}.\n\nA hopper can be used to craft a minecart with hopper.\n\nSee also: Redstone circuit and Redstone components \u00a7 Hopper Flowchart of hopper logic While a hopper is not powered by redstone signals, it operates with three functions: Collect item entities (free-floating items in the world) into its inventory from the space above it Pull a single item into its inventory from a container above it Push a single item from its own inventory into a container it faces A hopper first attempts to push any items inside it.\n\nAfterward, it checks if the block above it is a type of container.\n\nIf so, it attempts to pull from it.\n\nOtherwise, the hopper attempts to collect item entities.\n\nNotably, hoppers can push to and pull from other hoppers, forming hopper pipes or hopper chains, which allow transporting items across several blocks and are further discussed below.\n\nWhen a hopper receives a redstone signal (and is considered to be \"activated\"), all three functions stop.\n\nTo avoid confusion over the terms \"activated\" and \"deactivated\", powered hoppers are often described as being locked and unpowered hoppers described as being unlocked.\n\nHoppers can be powered by soft powered blocks, meaning a redstone dust trail pointing into a block touching the hopper locks it just as effectively as a redstone block or any other power component touching the hopper.\n\nWhen the hopper is unlocked during a redstone tick, it does not push or pull/collect during the same tick, but has a delay of 1 redstone tick instead.\n\nWhile a locked hopper does not push or pull/collect items, it may still receive items from dispensers, droppers and other hoppers, and may have its items pulled out by another hopper beneath it.\n\nHence, the item flow in a horizontal hopper pipe may be stopped by locking just one of the hoppers, but stopping a vertical hopper pipe requires locking two adjacent hoppers at the same time, such that both the pushing of the top one and the pulling of the bottom one are stopped.\n\nA hopper does not output any redstone signals by itself, but its fullness can be read using a redstone comparator, which needs to be placed next to it and facing away from it.\n\nAn empty hopper outputs a signal strength of 0 and a completely full hopper outputs a signal strength of 15.\n\nNotably, a single stackable item (16 or 64) outputs a signal strength of 1 and a single non-stackable item outputs a signal strength of 3.\n\nIn Java Edition, if the hopper being read is part of a horizontal hopper pipe, the comparator can individually read each item passing through the chain, because items are pushed through the hoppers one by one at a speed that is manageable by the comparator.\n\nIf there is an uninterrupted stream of items, the comparator does not switch off in between items.\n\nOn the other hand, in a vertical hopper pipe, some of the hoppers may never produce a reading above 0, even with a continuous stream of items, because pushes and pulls both occur in the same game tick: The hoppers' items get pulled out a single game tick after they're pushed in and this isn't measurable by a comparator, because comparators need measurements lasting at least 1.5 redstone ticks to produce a reading.\n\nA hopper collects items dropped on top of it if the space above the hopper not occupied by a storage block.\n\nItems are gathered from the entire 1 block space above the hopper, meaning that items sitting on partial blocks such as soul sand directly above a hopper can be collected.\n\n[1] It is also possible for a hopper to collect items from inside a full, solid block, a situation that might come from items rising up through solid blocks or being summoned.\n\nItem entities are not collected when they are outside of the collection area however; for example, items on top of a stone block directly above a hopper are not collected.\n\nCollected items are placed in the leftmost empty slot of a hopper's inventory.\n\nIn Java Edition, if there is no container above the hopper, then the hopper collects dropped items in the order in which they landed on the hopper.\n\nThis order is remembered even while a hopper is locked.\n\nFor instance, if a hopper is locked under a carpet while a fully equipped armor stand is broken above it, then it always collects items in this order when it is unlocked: armor stand, boots, leggings, chestplates, helmets.\n\nThis is due to the order in which these items land.\n\n[verify ] In Bedrock Edition, hoppers do not remember the order in which items land on the hopper.\n\nInstead, hoppers with multiple dropped items above them collect the items in the order in which they entered the chunk in which the hopper is located.\n\nItems that drop from a broken armor stand are collected in a random order.\n\n[2] Hoppers usually check for dropped items every game tick and they can collect items even before they are picked up by a player [verify ] or destroyed by lava.\n\nHowever, in Bedrock Edition hoppers have a \"collection cooldown\" time.\n\nAfter collecting an item (or stack of items), a hopper waits 4 redstone ticks (0.4 seconds, barring lag) before attempting to collect again.\n\nHoppers collect groups of items all at once rather than collecting them as single items one at a time.\n\nAs a result, hoppers can collect item entities much faster than they can pull items from a container.\n\nPulling from a moving minecart with chest or minecart with hopper is even slower, since the minecart is not always above the hopper.\n\nA hopper with a storage container above it (such as a furnace, chest, dropper, composter, or another hopper) attempts to pull from the container instead of checking for floating items above it, and hence can not collect items.\n\nA hopper always tries to push or pull items using the leftmost available slot.\n\nWhen a hopper is removing items from a chest, the items disappear from left to right.\n\nSimilarly, when filling up a chest, the chest fills up from left to right.\n\nHoppers prioritize pulling from the first slot of a container over pulling into the first hopper slot.\n\nIf a hopper has stone in its first slot and nothing in its second while the container it is pulling from has chicken in its first slot but stone in the second, the hopper pulls the chicken from the first slot of the container into its empty second slot.\n\nHowever, if the hopper is unable to pull the chicken, such as if all slots are filled with stone, the hopper pulls the stone from the second slot of the container instead.\n\nSimilarly, hoppers prioritize pushing from their first slot over pushing into the first slot of a container.\n\nIf a hopper has stone in its first slot and chicken in its second while the container it is pushing to has chicken it its first slot but stone in the second, the hopper pushes stone from its first slot into the second slot of the container.\n\nIn Java Edition the checks done by a hopper while pulling generally require less processing than the checks done by a hopper attempting collection.\n\nTherefore, a chain of hoppers topped with storage containers rather than air/solid blocks has better performance (measured as milliseconds of processing per tick) and lower potential for processing lag.\n\n[3] The performance improvement achieved is correlated with the number of storage slots the container has.\n\nPlacing composters (with no storage slots but still with custom output logic) on top of hoppers provide the greatest efficiency, while double chests actually degrade performance, even when sharing each double chest across two hoppers.\n\n[3] In Bedrock Edition a chain of hoppers with air or non-container blocks on top has better performance than a chain of hoppers topped by container blocks.\n\n[4] This may be because, even though hoppers with containers on top do not check for items, they do check for hopper-minecarts and chest-minecarts to pull from, and that involves scanning the chunk entity list.\n\n[5] A B Push then Pull Chest A is full of items while the hopper and Chest B are empty.\n\nItem pushes and pulls are processed in the same game tick, but pushes are processed before pulls.\n\nIn the schematic, the empty hopper first pulls an item from chest A as it cannot push anything into chest B.\n\nAfter the cooldown, the hopper first pushes its item into chest B before pulling another item from chest A, both pushing and pulling in the same tick, and the process repeats.\n\nThe hopper stops pulling when A is empty, and stops pushing when B becomes full.\n\nHoppers also have a \"transfer cooldown\" time.\n\nAfter pulling and/or pushing items, a hopper waits 4 redstone ticks (0.4 seconds, barring lag) before pulling or pushing again (a transfer rate of 2.5 items per second, barring lag).\n\nA hopper that has an item pushed into it from another hopper also starts a 4 tick cooldown period, regardless of whether it pushed or pulled items itself.\n\nItem entities can be collected at any time without affecting the transfer cooldown time.\n\nThe transfer cooldown and the Bedrock Edition collection cooldown are independent of each other.\n\nSome containers interact with hoppers in specific ways: Composter Hoppers above composters can push compostable items into the composter's top face with a chance of increasing the level of the composter as if the player used the item on the composter.\n\nItems that are not compostable cannot be pushed into the composter.\n\nHoppers below the composter can pull bone meal when the composter is in stage 8, emptying the composter and resetting it to stage 0.\n\nHoppers to the side of a composter do not interact with it.\n\nBrewing Stand A working hopper on the top face of a brewing stand deposits only into the ingredient slot and it can push only valid brewing ingredients.\n\nA hopper on side face of a brewing stand can deposit only blaze powder or filled bottles into the three brew slots.\n\nA hopper underneath a brewing stand always extracts from the three brew slots, whether brewing is finished or not\u2014The hopper must be locked to allow potions to finish brewing.\n\nChest Trapped Chest Large chests and large trapped chests are treated as a single container: A hopper depositing into a large chest fills up the entire chest and a hopper underneath a large chest empties the entire chest.\n\nTrapped chests being accessed by a player lock any adjacent hoppers, per the standard behavior of a hopper next to an active power source.\n\nFurnace Blast Furnace Smoker A working hopper pointing into top of a furnace deposits only into the ingredient slot.\n\nIt can push any item, including items that can't be smelted by the furnace.\n\nA hopper pointing into the side of a furnace deposits into the fuel slot, and only items that are usable as fuel.\n\nA hopper below a furnace pulls everything from the output slot and empty buckets from the fuel slot left over from using lava buckets as fuel.\n\nWhen a hopper removes items from a furnace, the experience points are 'stored' in the furnace until a player removes at least one smelted item, or the furnace block is broken.\n\nHopper A sequence of three or more hoppers, each pushing items into the next, is called a hopper pipe.\n\nWorking horizontal hopper pipes simply push items into each other at the expected rate of 2.5 items per second, but vertical hopper pipes are more complicated, as the hoppers are trying both to pull and to push.\n\nWhen a vertical pipe pulls from a single container, it simply transfers items at 2.5 items per second because the transfer rate is limited by the first hopper pulling items from the container.\n\nIf a stack of items is in a vertical pipe, the items can be transferred twice as fast, because the hopper with the item stack is pushing items down while the hopper below it is also pulling items down.\n\nMinecart with Chest Minecart with Hopper Unlocked hoppers fill chest minecarts and hopper minecarts if any part of the entity's hitbox is within the hopper's target block-space.\n\nHopper minecarts try to pull items from the hopper at high speed.\n\nHoppers can pull items from minecarts above them so rails can be placed directly on the top faces of a hoppers.\n\nIf a detector rail is in the right position, it could lock the hopper per standard redstone-hopper behavior.\n\nJukebox Hoppers can insert music discs into jukeboxes, and extract the music discs after they finish playing.\n\nShulker Box Hoppers cannot put shulker boxes into other shulker boxes.\n\nThis allows for the creation of certain item filters.\n\nOtherwise, hoppers interact with shulker boxes normally.\n\nLectern Hoppers cannot remove or place books on lecterns.\n\nThe redstone pulse emitted from a lectern when a page is turned can temporarily lock hoppers.\n\nEnder Chest Hoppers cannot interact with ender chests in any way.\n\nBarrel Dispenser Dropper Boat with Chest Hoppers interact normally with barrels, dispensers, droppers, and boats with chests.\n\nChiseled Bookshelf Hoppers and minecart with hoppers can insert and remove books from the bookshelf.\n\nAs with any other container, items are taken from the first slot that has an item that can fit in the hopper and are inserted into the first empty slot.\n\nJava Edition: \u2191 a b MC-177082 Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: \u2191 a b c MC-98316 \u2014 Wrong subtitles

sources?\n\nNo Flow distance 4 blocks (Overworld, End) 8 blocks (Nether) Flow speed 30 ticks /block (Overworld, End) 10 ticks /block (Nether) Lava is a light-emitting fluid that causes fire damage, mostly found in the lower reaches of the Overworld and the Nether.\n\nLava blocks do not exist as items (at least in Java Edition), but can be retrieved with a bucket.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, they may be obtained as an item via glitches (in old versions), add-ons or inventory editing.\n\nLava may be obtained renewably from cauldrons, as pointed dripstone with a lava source above it can slowly fill a cauldron with lava.\n\nDuring world generation, lava replaces air blocks generated in caves and canyons between Y=-55 and Y=-63.\n\nAquifers are sometimes filled with lava below Y=0.\n\nLava does not replace air blocks inside mineshafts, monster rooms, amethyst geodes, or strongholds.\n\nLava can also occur as lava flows from a single spring block, pouring down walls into pools.\n\nThe spring block can be on the side of a cave, ravine, mineshaft, or stone cliff above ground.\n\nLava also generates as small lava lakes, which can be found above Y=0 within any biome.\n\nTwo blocks of lava can also be found in plains, snowy plains, and desert village weaponsmith buildings, or one source in savanna village weaponsmith buildings.\n\nFifteen blocks of lava can be found in the end portal room of a stronghold: 3 along each side wall, and 9 below the portal frame.\n\nLava also generates in woodland mansions: two blocks of lava generate in the \"blacksmith room\", and 25 blocks of lava generate in a secret \"lava room\".\n\nIn the Nether, lava is more common than water in the Overworld.\n\nSeas of lava occur, with sea level at y-level 32, about a quarter of the total height of the Nether (as the usable space in the Nether is 128 blocks tall).\n\nThey can extend down to about y-level 19-22.\n\nLava also randomly appears in single blocks inside netherrack formations.\n\nLava is also generated as a single source in well rooms in nether fortresses.\n\nThere are also large pockets of lava generated under y-19 and can reach all the way down to bedrock level.\n\nThese pockets are generally over 12 blocks in height and often connect to a large lava lake on y-32; the size of these pockets in 1.18 can range from the size of a singular pre-1.18 ravine to multiple ravines combined.\n\nLava generates as delta shapes, which can be found commonly in the basalt deltas biome.\n\nLava also generates in ruined portals and bastion remnants.\n\nUnlike water source blocks, new lava source blocks cannot be created in a space by two or more adjacent source blocks.\n\nHowever in Java Edition, if the game rule lavaSourceConversion is set to true, new lava source blocks can form in a similar way to water source blocks.\n\nIf there is a lava source above the pointed dripstone stalactite, there is a 15 \u2044 256 (~5.9%) chance for it to completely fill an empty cauldron within 10 blocks under the tip with lava after a random tick.\n\nThis lava can then be scooped with a bucket, making it a renewable resource.\n\nWhen used in a furnace, a bucket of lava lasts 1000 seconds (100 items).\n\nNote that when used as fuel, a bucket of lava turns into a normal bucket.\n\nWhat it looks like inside lava.\n\nWhat it looks like inside lava using Fire Resistance in Java Edition.\n\nMost entities take 4 damage every half-second while in contact with lava, and are set on fire.\n\nAn entity/player in lava will also have its remainingFireTicks set to 300, setting it on fire for 15 seconds.\n\nThis timer is reset to 300 every tick that the victim spends in lava, so it will only start counting down once the victim leaves the lava.\n\nOnce the victim does exit the lava source, it will burn for just under 15 seconds, taking fire damage 14 times.\n\nThis is due to the fact that for the first tick outside of lava, its remainingFireTicks decrease to 299, and entities take fire damage when remainingFireTicks is a multiple of 20 and greater than 0.\n\nIf the victim touches water or rain falls on it, the fire is extinguished, but the lava continues to damage them directly.\n\nIn addition, a dense fog effect will be applied for players under lava to obscure vision.\n\nThis can be slightly mitigated via the Fire Resistance effect.\n\nAn entity/player moving in lava has their horizontal movement speed reduced by 50% and their vertical movement speed reduced by 20%.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a player with the Fire Resistance effect or a total Fire Protection of 7 or higher does not catch fire.\n\nVexes, zoglins, Nether mobs (excluding piglins and hoglins), withers, wardens, and players or mobs affected by the Fire Resistance effect are not damaged when touching lava.\n\nThe embers or fireballs that fly out of lava are purely decorative and do not cause fires or damage to entities.\n\nWhen rain falls on lava, the black ember particles appear more frequently.\n\nA player in lava lasts a few seconds before dying: 2.5 seconds with no armor 3.5 seconds with full leather armor, no enchantments 4 seconds with full gold armor, no enchantments 4.5 seconds with full chain armor, no enchantments 5.5 seconds with full iron armor, no enchantments 10.5 seconds with full diamond armor, no enchantments 11 seconds with full netherite armor, no enchantments 2.5 seconds with no armor 3.5 seconds with full leather armor, no enchantments 4.5 seconds with full gold armor, no enchantments 5 seconds with full chain armor, no enchantments 6.5 seconds with full iron armor, no enchantments 12.5 seconds with full diamond armor, no enchantments 12.5 seconds with full netherite armor, no enchantments If the player is wearing armor enchanted with Fire Protection, they can last even longer.\n\nWith the maximum bonus, the damage is small enough that the natural healing from a full hunger bar can outpace it  [JE only ], so a player could survive indefinitely as long as they have food and their armor holds up (non-netherite armor is damaged by lava).\n\nThis maximum bonus can be obtained by wearing 2 pieces of armor with Fire Protection IV and 1 with Protection IV, or 1 piece of armor with Fire Protection IV and 3 with Protection IV.\n\nLava can cause fires by turning air blocks to fire blocks.\n\nIn order for air above lava to turn to fire, a block adjacent to the air has to be flammable, or one of the wood-constructed non-flammable blocks.\n\nSince catching fire depends on air blocks, even torches or lava itself can prevent a flammable block from catching fire.\n\nAdditionally, not all flammable or wood-constructed blocks can be ignited by lava.\n\nThe lava of any depth can start fires this way, whether or not it appears to have a current.\n\nAdditional conditions must be met, depending on the edition of Minecraft.\n\nExample for JE.\n\nThe orange area represents areas where air could catch flame if the gray and orange areas contain flammable blocks.\n\nThe wood is all at a safe distance.\n\nAir block must be in a 3\u00d71\u00d73 area right above the lava or in a 5\u00d71\u00d75 2 blocks above the lava.\n\nNote that an air block in the 5x1x5 area will not catch on fire if the 3x1x3 area is completely filled, even if the latter is filled with flammable blocks.\n\nThe block to be set on fire must be in a 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube centered on a lava block, above which there must be either air or an ignitable block.\n\nSee also: Fluid Lava flows from \"source blocks\".\n\nMost streams or \"lava-falls\" come from a single source block, but lava lakes (including the \"flood lava\" in the bottom 10 layers) are composed entirely of source blocks.\n\nA source block can be captured only with a bucket.\n\nIn the Overworld and the End, lava travels 3 blocks in any horizontal direction from a source block.\n\nLava flows far more slowly than water (1 block every 30 game ticks, or 1.5 seconds), and sourceless lava flows linger for a short time more.\n\nIn the Nether, lava travels 7 blocks horizontally and spreads 1 block every 10 game ticks, or 2 blocks per second, which is half the speed as water in the Overworld.\n\nIn all dimensions, lava spreading uses the same mechanic as water: for every adjacent block it can flow into it tries to find a way down that is reachable in

this decreases the radius by a 1 \u2044 2 block immediately, reducing the cloud's lifespan by 5 seconds.\n\nFor effects with duration, the duration applied by the cloud is 1 \u2044 4 that of the corresponding potion.\n\nFor effects without duration such as healing or harming, the potency of the effect is 1 \u2044 2 that of the corresponding potion.\n\nThe effect may be applied consecutively if the player or mob remains in the cloud.\n\nFor example, a player throwing the Lingering Potion of Healing II straight down consumes the cloud within a few seconds while being healed 5 times for a total of 20 \u00d7 10 health.\n\nAs far as healing is concerned, this makes the lingering potion much more powerful than the regular or splash potion, provided that the player is away from other mobs or players.\n\nLingering potions can also be thrown out of dispensers like splash potions.\n\nLike the splash water bottle, a lingering water bottle puts out fire and damages endermen and blazes by 1.\n\nIt creates no effect cloud.\n\nLingering water bottles can be used on dirt, coarse dirt, or rooted dirt to turn it into mud.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, using a lingering potion on a cauldron adds one level of that potion to the cauldron.\n\nAttempting to add a lingering potion to a cauldron with water, dyed water or a non-matching potion empties the cauldron and creates an explosion sound (but no actual explosion).\n\nIn Java Edition, the uncraftable potion is a splash potion with no effect that is unobtainable in regular gameplay.\n\nIt is also available in potion and splash potion forms, as well as for tipped arrows.\n\nIt can be obtained using the following command: / give @s minecraft:lingering_potion{Potion:\"minecraft:empty\"}.\n\nIt is also obtained any time a potion has invalid or missing potion effect tags, and thus serves as a placeholder.\n\nIn Java Edition, lingering potions can be obtained with any status effect using / give and the tag CustomPotionEffects, which is an array of effects for the potion.\n\nSee Item format#Potion Effects for more information, and status effect for a list of effects and IDs.\n\nJava Edition: Lingering potions use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: tag: The item's tag tag.\n\ncustom_potion_effects: The custom potion effects (status effects) this potion or tipped arrow has.\n\nOne of these for each effect.\n\nid: The resource location of the effect.\n\namplifier: The amplifier of the effect, with level I having value 0.\n\nNegative levels are discussed here.\n\nOptional, and defaults to level I.\n\nduration: The duration of the effect in ticks.\n\nValues 0 or lower are treated as 1.\n\nOptional, and defaults to 1 tick.\n\nambient: 1 or 0 (true/false) - whether or not this is an effect provided by a beacon and therefore should be less intrusive on the screen.\n\nOptional, and defaults to false.\n\nshow_particles: 1 or 0 (true/false) - whether or not this effect produces particles.\n\nOptional, and defaults to true.\n\nshow_icon: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if effect icon is shown.\n\nfalse if no icon is shown.\n\nPotion: The name of the default potion effect.\n\nThis name differs from the status effect name.\n\nFor example, the value for an \"Instant Health II\" potion is \"minecraft:strong_healing\".\n\nA potion or tipped arrow getting its effects from this tag is named with the proper effect.\n\nThe default value is \"minecraft:empty\", which gives it the \"Uncraftable\" name.\n\nCustomPotionColor: The item uses this custom color, and area-of-effect clouds, arrows, and splash and lingering potions use it for their particle effects.\n\nThis color does not extend, however, to the particles given off by entities who ultimately receive the effect.\n\nThe numeric color codes are equal to the hex code of the color converted to a decimal number, or can alternatively be calculated from the Red, Green and Blue components using this formula: Red << 16 + Green <<8 + Blue.\n\nFor positive values larger than 0x00FFFFFF, the top byte is ignored.\n\nAll negative values produce white.\n\nThrown lingering potion Behavior Does not exist Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: See also: Chunk format and Potion data values Lingering potions when thrown have entity data that define various properties of the entity.\n\nEntity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all projectiles Item: The item that was thrown.\n\nThe entity renders as a lingering potion if the id is lingering_potion, otherwise it renders as a splash potion.\n\nTags common to all potion items Area Effect Cloud Behavior Does not exist Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: See also: Chunk format The cloud that is created when: lingering potions are thrown;

    "content": "This article is about the craftable map.\n\nFor maps showing the locations of certain structures, see Explorer Map.\n\nFor other uses, see Map (disambiguation).\n\nNot to be confused with World.\n\nMap Rarity Common Renewable Yes Stackable Yes (64) A map is an item used to view explored terrain and mark landmarks.\n\n\u2191 Named unknown map, but changed to map 0, the scale level is 1:4, Maps from the same stack are stackable, but maps that are not stacked are unstackable despite looking identical.\n\nA map can also be created using a single paper on a cartography table to create an empty map, or a paper with a compass for an empty locator map. [Bedrock Edition only ] This feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition.\n\nWhen creating a new world in Bedrock Edition, the player can enable the \"Starting Map\" option to spawn with an empty locator map in the hotbar.\n\nThe map's zoom scale is 1:8.\n\nThe map is updated only while the player holds it.\n\nNovice-level cartographer villagers sell a single empty map for 7 emeralds as their trades.\n\nIn Java Edition, cartographer villagers may give players with the Hero of the Village effect an empty map.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Mapping Crafting a map creates an empty map.\n\nThe map is drawn for the first time when it is held and used (with use item).\n\nThis map can then be adjusted to different zoom levels.\n\nAfter conversion to a drawn map item, it starts to draw a top-down view of the player's surroundings, with North pointing to the top of the map.\n\nA pointed oval pointer indicates the player's position on the map, and moves in real-time as the player moves across the terrain shown on the map.\n\nThe map does not center on the player when created, rather, the world is broken up into large invisible grid squares, and the map displays the area of whichever grid square it is in when it is first used.\n\nFor example, if a player uses a new map in a certain grid square, and then moves a distance away and uses another fresh map but is still within the same grid square, both maps appear identical.\n\nTo make a map that is not identical to the first one, the player would have to move outside of the edges of the first map (because then they would be in a new grid square).\n\nThis way, no two maps of the same size can ever partially overlap and every map can display only a fixed area.\n\nTo record the world on a map, that specific map must be held in the player's hands while the player moves around the world.\n\nThe world is recorded as-is during exploration, meaning that if the world is modified, a player must revisit the area while holding the map to update the map's view.\n\nMaps can also be cloned.\n\nIf a player holds a map whose one or more clones are on display in item frames, updates are made on all clone-connected maps.\n\nOther players are displayed on the map only if they have a map in their inventory cloned from the one being looked at.\n\nWhen placing a map into an item frame, the map displays with a green pointer shown at the location of the item frame.\n\nThis is to help the player see where they are in relation to the area that the map is showing.\n\nIf the player leaves a map in an item frame and views a clone of it, the green pointer remains in the spot of the framed copy.\n\nThis can be used to set up waypoints.\n\nUnexplored areas are transparent, making the item frame visible.\n\nWhen the player leaves the area shown on a specific map, the player pointer transforms into a white dot that moves on that map.\n\nThe marker shrinks to a smaller white dot if the player is far from the map's center: the area is 320 by 320 blocks per scale factor.\n\nThe dot moves along the edge of the map to show the relative location of the player.\n\nHowever in Bedrock Edition, the pointer remains as an arrow but shrinks until the player is near the area shown on the map.\n\nWhile maps in the Nether work, they show only the red-and-gray pattern, regardless of the blocks placed.\n\nThe only useful function is finding where the player is in relation to placed framed maps, which show as green pointers.\n\nAdditionally, the player pointer rapidly spins and is not a good indicator of direction.\n\nPlacing a banner in the Nether still shows it on the map as usual.\n\nHaving a smaller map image while riding a strider in the Nether can help one to see one's footing while traveling over lava.\n\nIn Java Edition, when using a map from another dimension, the map shows the player's position and direction when they were last in the dimension of the map.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, however, the player can use maps from one dimension while in another dimension.\n\nFor locator maps, the place marker changes color depending on the dimension that the player is currently in (white for the Overworld, red for the Nether, and magenta for the End).\n\nAn Overworld map in the Nether shows the player's corresponding location and direction in the Overworld.\n\n[1] Similarly, a Nether Map in the Overworld shows the player's corresponding location in the Overworld, but the place marker spins, just like a Nether map in the Nether.\n\nAn Overworld map in the End shows the world spawn.\n\n[1] A Nether map cannot be used in the End \u2014 the map appears, but the place marker is not shown anywhere \u2014 and similarly, an End map cannot be used in the Overworld or the Nether.\n\nA player can make a large piece of pixel art (128\u00d7128) facing upward, center a map on it, and place that map in an item frame to create a custom picture.\n\nLocking is recommended.\n\nSee Map item format#Map Pixel Art for details on the techniques.\n\nMaps display as a mini-map when held in the off-hand, or if the off-hand slot is occupied; the map is full-sized only when held in the dominant hand with both hands free.\n\nA map always positions itself facing towards North when placed horizontally within an item frame regardless of how the map is placed.\n\nMain article: Map item format Maps consist of square pixels arranged like pixels in a 128\u00d7128 square pattern, with each pixel representing a square portion of land.\n\nIn Java Edition, the color of a map pixel generally matches the color of the most common opaque block in the corresponding area, as seen from the sky.\n\n'Minority blocks' in the target area have no effect on the color of the pixel, thus small features tend to be undetectable on zoomed-out maps.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the color of a map pixel instead matches the single top-most opaque block in a grid sized by the map magnification pixel size (see the table in the \"Player marker and pointer\" section below).\n\nFor example, a 3/4 magnification map has a pixel size of 8x8 blocks; this means the map will read only the top-most opaque blocks at the 0,0 coordinate, the 8,0 coordinate, the 0,8 coordinate, etcetera, ignoring all other blocks in the area.\n\nThis means that in Bedrock Edition, map pixel art requires only one block per pixel regardless of map magnification.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, grass, foliage and water colors that are biome-dependent are represented accurately on a map.\n\nMaps also show ground up to about 15 blocks below the surface of the water in oceans as slightly lighter blue, to show where the ground rises.\n\nThis is not true with land above water.\n\nHigher elevations in the world mean lighter colors on the map.\n\nThe map records the surface even as the player moves below the surface.\n\nA standard map represents 128x128 blocks (1 block per pixel, 8x8 chunks) but maps can be zoomed-out to represent up to 2048x2048 blocks (16 square blocks per pixel, 128x128 chunks).\n\nSome relevant distances: 64 blocks (4 chunks) is the update radius from a player in the Overworld and the End.\n\nHowever, it is half this (32 blocks) in the Nether.\n\nAlso, 1024 blocks is the minimum Overworld distance from a nether portal, at which players can build another portal and expect to reach a new location in the Nether.\n\nThis is the distance across a 1:8 map, and also from a 1:16 map's center to its edge.\n\nIn Java Edition, every map contains a marker that marks the position of the player, and points in the same direction as the player.\n\nWhen a player moves out of a map, a big white dot appears and moves relative to the player's position.\n\nThe pointer either disappears when the player moves away a certain distance from the border of the map or, in case of explorer maps, the big white dot changes to a smaller white dot.\n\nThe distance required for the small white dot to appear(explorer maps) or for the big dot to vanish (normal maps) changes with the scaling of the map.\n\nLevel 0/4: 128\u00d7128 blocks (each map pixel represents 1 block) Level 1/4: 256\u00d7256 blocks (2\u00d72 blocks per map pixel) Level 2/4: 512\u00d7512 blocks (4\u00d74 blocks per map pixel) Level 3/4: 1024\u00d71024 blocks (8\u00d78 blocks per map pixel) Level 4/4: 2048\u00d72048 blocks (16\u00d716 blocks per map pixel) In Bedrock Edition, a map can be crafted with or without this marker, and a map without a position marker can add one later by adding a compass to the map.\n\nWhen a map is crafted without a compass, it's simply called an \"empty map\", but when crafted with a compass, it's called an \"empty locator map\".\n\nThe marker also turns red if the player enters the Nether with an Overworld map and shows the player's Overworld location relative to the Nether location.\n\nA map created in the End has a purple marker showing the player's location.\n\nIf an Overworld map is used in the End, a magenta dot appears on the player's spawn point.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a cartography table can also be used to add a pointer to create a locator map or empty locator map.\n\nThis can be done by adding a compass to paper, or to an empty map or map.\n\nIn Java Edition, cartography table's UI, showing the map is being zoomed out.\n\nA cartography table can also be used to zoom out, taking only one piece of paper per zoom level.\n\nA blank map can not be zoomed out.\n\nA map has to have something already marked on it for the zooming to be possible.\n\nThe zooming function starts from when the map is created (zoom level 0) up to its fourth zoom step (zoom level 4).\n\nMaps are always aligned to a grid at all zoom levels.\n\nThat means zooming out any different map in a specific area covered by that map always has the same center.\n\nAs such, maps are aligned by map width (1024 blocks for a level 3 maps) minus 64.\n\nA level 3 map generated at spawn covers X and Z coordinates from -64 to 959.\n\nAll maps generated in this area zoom out to the same coordinates, guaranteeing that they are always 'aligned' on a map wall.\n\nFor a zoomed-out map to cover a new area, it must start with a base (level 0) map that is in that area.\n\nAt zoom level 0, a map created on the point (0,0) has (0,0) at the center of the map.\n\nAt higher zoom levels of the same map, the coordinate (0,0) is in the top left square of the map.\n\nIn Java Edition, zoom level can be seen on a map by turning on Advanced Tooltips (a debug screen option that can be toggled by using the key combination F3 + H).\n\nThe tooltip of the map then shows the zoom level, scaling factors, and map ID.\n\nIn Java Edition, cartography table's UI, showing the map is being cloned.\n\nA mix of empty maps and empty locator maps may be used.\n\nWhether the cloned maps show position markers is dependent only on the input map.\n\nA cartography table can also be used to clone a map.\n\nThe parts of the world that have already been explored and mapped are copied, and newly explored areas appear on both instances.\n\nIf one of the maps is later zoomed out, then the maps lose their connection to each other and function as completely separate maps that have to be individually filled by exploring.\n\nIn Creative mode, a map in an item frame may be cloned by using pick block on it, as long as that map is not also in the player's inventory.\n\nIt doesn't matter if the map to be cloned is at a higher zoom level (made of more paper) than the blank map.\n\nUpon copying the map, both resulting maps have the same magnification as the starting map.\n\nIn Java Edition the player has the ability to mark spots on a map.\n\nTo do this, use a map on a placed-down banner, and the spot of the banner gets marked on the map.\n\nThe mark takes the color of whatever the base color is for the banner, and if the banner has a name, the mark shows that name.\n\nBanner marks on a map are always oriented with their top facing north, regardless of the banner's actual orientation.\n\nIf the banner is destroyed, the mark of the banner remains at first, but if the player gets closer to where the banner previously was, it disappears as the area is updated on the map.\n\nIf a map is mounted on an item frame and is within the area it depicts, the mounted map displays its current location with a green indicator rotated to match its orientation.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition this is what a map lying on an item frame looks like, while showing markers.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition the player can place copies of locator maps in item frames in order to create a land mark.\n\nThe marker is a green dot that resembles the shape of the player's marker, but in green color.\n\nThe position the marker points at depends on the direction the item frame is facing.\n\nIt is worth noting that the markers work only on copies of the same map.\n\nOther maps of the same area do not show the existing markers that the player(s) had placed.\n\nIf a player has a cloned map in their inventory, their pointer appears white when viewed on the same map held by another player.\n\nHence, if all players have the same cloned map in their inventory, all markers would appear white when the clone map is viewed.\n\nIn Java Edition, cartography table's UI, showing the map is being locked.\n\nMaps can be locked when using a glass pane in a cartography table.\n\nThis creates a new map containing the same data and locks it.\n\nAll copies of this new map are also locked.\n\nA locked map never changes, even when the depicted terrain changes.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, locked maps have a unique texture.\n\nJava Edition: Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: See also: Bedrock Edition data values In Bedrock Edition, maps use the following data values: Empty map: Filled map: Java Edition: Main article: Player.dat format tag: The item's tag tag.\n\nmap: The map number.\n\nmap_scale_direction: Only internally used when

\"Map\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nUse of the F1 key can allow the player to hold a map without blocking their view at all.\n\nIn Java Edition, a map created using / give can be any map by using the Map parameter to specify the map number desired.\n\nE.g.\n\n/ give [player] minecraft:filled_map{map:5} gives the specified player map_5.\n\nIf no data value is supplied it defaults to map_0.\n\nIf map_0 has not ever been crafted, it is centered on x=0, z=0.\n\nThe maps are stored separately as their own data (.dat) file as map_x.dat with (x) being the map number, see map item format for more info.\n\nBy manipulating this number, players can organize their maps to suit them, or if they accidentally create a map in the same location, they can delete their extra map so as to save the number they make.\n\nCertain programs can be used to make customized maps with images or text on them instead of actual maps, many people use these in adventure maps to show pictures or to tell a story.\n\nSince all copies of a map are links to the same file, copying an unfinished map keeps it synchronized with the copy as the player fills it in.\n\nThus, a copy stored in a chest can act as a remote backup.\n\nA map that is in an item frame does not update itself until a player picks it up, lets it reload, and places it back again.\n\nHowever, if a player holds a clone of the map, both maps update.\n\nFilled maps are the only items that make 90 degree rotations in item frames, and also the only items that can expand the item frame into full block wide.\n\nOn Legacy Console Edition, the player always spawns with a map in their inventory after creating a world.\n\nThis was later added to Bedrock Edition as an optional feature in the world

    "content": "This article is about the rideable minecart in Minecraft.\n\nFor other uses, see Minecart (disambiguation).\n\nNot to be confused with Minecraft.\n\nMinecart Rarity color Common Health 6 Stackable No Renewable Yes Size Height: 0.7 Blocks Width: 0.98 Blocks Drops Minecart (1) Network ID JE: 10 A minecart is a train-like vehicle entity that runs on rails.\n\nMinecarts can be retrieved by attacking them for some time.\n\nMinecarts can also be retrieved with one attack from a pickaxe provided the player's attack cooldown is reset.\n\nA minecart is also destroyed if it makes contact with a cactus, or if shot with a bow and arrow.\n\nMinecart with command blocks can be given to the player with the / give command or through the Creative inventory under certain conditions [Java Edition only ]; minecart with monster spawners  [Java Edition only ] are available only via the / summon command.\n\nEach drop 1 minecart when broken.\n\nA rideable minecart on rails surrounded by wood slabs A minecart can be placed in the same manner as most blocks but can be placed only on top of a rail.\n\nOnce placed, it may be derailed by pushing it off the end of the track.\n\nAfter this, it can be railed again by placing a rail directly below it or pushing it onto a track.\n\nSteve riding a minecart See also: Transportation and Riding Minecarts can be ridden by pressing the \"use\" control on them.\n\nOnce inside, an external impulse may be needed to make the minecart start moving.\n\nThe player can slowly move the minecart forward while riding it, by pressing forward.\n\nIf a mob walks in front of an empty minecart, it is pulled into the cart.\n\nAfter rolling off of the end of a track, a minecart can be pushed around on open blocks.\n\nIf a minecart is pushed onto or falls onto tracks, it \"snaps\" to those tracks.\n\nWhen riding a minecart, if the minecart lands on a rail, the player does not take any fall damage.\n\nUnlike with beds, there is no message above the hotbar for attempting to enter a fully occupied minecart.\n\n[1] Players can exit the minecart by pressing sneak.\n\nWhen a player or mob dismounts a minecart, either by choice, by breaking the minecart, or by passing over an activator rail, the minecart tries to find a safe ejection destination one block away.\n\nFirst it checks the eight horizontally adjacent blocks in the following order of priority relative to direction of travel: right, left, rear right, rear left, front right, front left, rear, front.\n\nA valid destination has a block underneath with a solid (not necessarily full) top surface and a space with enough headroom and width for the passenger to fit in when standing at the center.\n\nThe space can even contain liquid or have open trapdoors if the mob is slim enough, and presence of other mobs doesn't matter.\n\nIf no valid destination exists on same horizontal level, the minecart then checks the blocks one above, then one below.\n\nFor a player, the minecart also checks for crawlable destinations.\n\nIf still none, the minecart chooses its own location.\n\nOnce the minecart picks a destination, it actually ejects the passenger one block up in the air and the passenger settles down on its own.\n\nUnder a low ceiling this may cause one tick of suffocation damage.\n\nThe air drop exists to allow passengers to land on carpet or bottom slabs.\n\nMinecarts have a predefined speed limit of exactly 8 blocks per second.\n\nHowever, this speed limit does not change the minecart's speed value but instead limits how far a minecart can travel each tick to 0.4 blocks.\n\nTherefore, a minecart moving from powered rail to normal rail will move at constant speed for some time until decelerating because its internal speed value is over its speed limit of 8.\n\nHowever, the maximum speed can be changed by the minecartMaxSpeed game rule.\n\nPowered rails powered by redstone give minecarts a boost of speed.\n\nSpeed is gradually decreased (due to drag) if there are no powered rails to assist its movement, and an unpowered powered rail slows down a minecart rapidly.\n\nThe speed decreases at a faster rate when going uphill, compared to when moving horizontally.\n\nA minecart does not need powered rails to assist its movement down a hill.\n\nAnything in the way of the minecart brings it to a stop.\n\nOnce a minecart has left the track, it rapidly decelerates within one or two blocks.\n\nWhen mobs touch a minecart, they affect it in the same way a player would, i.e.\n\nmobs that move up against a still cart set it in motion.\n\nIf a minecart is moving fast enough, it can skip across one block without a track and reattach to track on the other side, at significantly reduced energy and speed.\n\nA minecart's hitbox can skip turns if the minecart is boosted using enough powered rails.\n\n[2] The speed and momentum of a minecart can differ depending on whether or not it is empty, and in the case where a minecart has a container, the speed can differ depending on the quantity and type of items inside.\n\nIn Java Edition, two or more minecarts can be merged by pushing them into each other so that they overlap.\n\nMerged minecarts move as a collective, like a train, and can be useful for long-distance transport because while moving in a straight line, they do not need powered rails to keep their speed.\n\nTo summarize: Minecarts can also be merged by dropping a minecart on another minecart.\n\nMerged minecarts do not lose speed while traveling on straight rails Corners in the rails might cause merged minecarts to unmerge.\n\nMinecarts with chest (even fully filled) can also be merged and also do not require powered rails.\n\nThis table shows the distance traveled by an unoccupied minecart on a downward slope, with a boost (or no boost).\n\nThe most efficient way is to use only 1 boost at the bottom of the incline on the flat surface.\n\nUsing 2 increases distance by about 20% or 1.5 blocks.\n\nAll distance trends based on the height seem to be logarithmic.\n\nThe carts started from rest, on a slope Height blocks up.\n\nMinecarts are about the same size as a block (1\u00d71).\n\nBecause of this, a ladder, door, or trapdoor prevents it from falling down a 1\u00d71 hole.\n\nCarts on rails also ignore collision in certain situations.\n\nA cart traveling uphill, downhill, or on a curve with a block placed in front of it, goes through the block.\n\n[3] A minecart that reaches the end of a rail up against an opaque solid block bounces back, but if the block is transparent then it stops.\n\nThe minecart can even bounce against an opaque block from a standstill if the rail underneath is powered.\n\nA player or mob riding in a minecart does not collide with or suffocate in any transparent blocks but suffocates inside opaque blocks.\n\nMinecarts are completely unaffected by ice, packed ice, and blue ice [4]; they can also be destroyed by coming in contact with lava or fire.\n\nMinecarts can even be pushed by flowing water.\n\nThis section is missing information about some other mobs that cannot be picked up by minecarts.\n\nPlease expand the section to include this information.\n\nFurther details may exist on the talk page.\n\nMinecart shaking due to being on top of an activator rail.\n\nMobs can ride minecarts, but cannot control them.\n\nMobs cannot exit the minecart unless the minecart is destroyed or moves onto an active activator rail.\n\n[5] However, in Bedrock Edition, endermen are able to teleport out of minecarts.\n\n[6] A mob can ride a minecart when pushing by a moving minecart on rails in Java Edition or when colliding with a minecart in Bedrock Edition.\n\nIt is easier to pick up a mob when a minecart is turning.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, armor stands can also be picked up.\n\nMost mobs can be picked up by minecarts, except ender dragons, wardens, and withers.\n\nIn Java Edition, iron golems cannot be picked up

    "content": "Minecart with Furnace Rarity color Common Health 6 Stackable No Renewable Yes Size Height: 0.7 Blocks Width: 0.98 Blocks Drops 1 Minecart with Furnace Network ID 10 A minecart with furnace is a furnace inside a minecart.\n\nIt can be powered with coal or charcoal to propel it across a rail line for a limited time, which can be used to move other minecarts.\n\nMinecarts with furnace can be retrieved by attacking them, and by doing so it drops as an item.\n\nMinecarts with furnaces are placed in the same way as other minecarts.\n\nIt does not have a graphical user interface, unlike a furnace.\n\nMinecarts with furnaces can be powered, done by feeding fuel (coal or charcoal) into the furnace minecart with the use button.\n\nThe fuel is consumed immediately and it starts to move in the same direction the player clicked toward.\n\nPressing use always turns it to that direction, even when not holding coal.\n\nAny piece of fuel, added at any time, increases the total range by an additional 3600 ticks (equal to 180 seconds or 3 minutes).\n\nThe upper limit is 32767 ticks, approximately 27 minutes.\n\nWhen powered, minecarts with furnaces cover 240m per minute (about 4 m/s, slightly slower than walking speed) or 720m per piece of coal.\n\nThey do not accelerate beyond this speed when going downhill or on active powered rails, and as long as they remain powered, they do not slow down when going uphill, on inactive powered rails, or when pushing or pulling other minecarts.\n\nIf a powered furnace minecart is derailed and then pushed back onto a rail, it starts moving again in the direction it came from, so they are not easily turned around in this state unless a player is nearby to redirect it with use.\n\nMinecarts with furnaces can climb up steep inclines while pushing other minecarts as long as they have fuel.\n\nIf a minecart with furnace reaches a slope while pulling another minecart, the pulled minecart is switched to the forward position so that it can be pushed along the slope instead of pulled.\n\nWhen a minecart with furnace bumps into another minecart or multiple minecarts, the other minecarts are pushed forward with great speed.\n\nThe furnace minecart continues on with its own speed.\n\nBecause of this speed difference, some of the minecarts may end up inside unloaded chunks on straight tracks.\n\nweakly-shunted 1-cart train, one cart was used only to push the train together and is left behind Creating a strongly-shunted 1-cart train.\n\nThe sloped rail must be replaced with a horizontal rail before powering.\n\nA Minecart train powered by furnace minecarts.\n\nA furnace minecart can be made to pull up to four other minecarts.\n\nAll minecarts in this train move at the constant speed of the furnace minecart.\n\nTrains are formed when a minecart is pushed into the back of a powered furnace minecart or a short-enough train.\n\nThese shunts are fragile at best and easily come undone, but some methods are stronger than others.\n\nFor example, pushing a minecart into a furnace minecart and then powering the furnace gives a weaker shunt than pushing the furnace minecart into the other minecart against a wall, and then powering the furnace in the other direction.\n\nA high-speed minecart running into the back of a furnace minecart going in the same direction automatically creates a weak shunt with it, pulling it along.\n\nPulling a minecart with TNT causes it to explode.\n\nWhen a train comes to a turn, the shunt comes undone with the pulled minecart jettisoned backward.\n\nThe correct way to make such a turn is having the shunt undone before a turn, and then make the two rejoin on a straight rail later by having the pulled cart catch up with the minecart with furnace.\n\n[1] Since the train runs slower on a fully powered track than a normal minecart (~5 m/s compared to 8m/s), a train pulled by an unpowered furnace minecart is ideal for AFK farms involving breaking or placing blocks like nether wart.\n\n[1] The coal is not stored as an item in the entity, but in the object data in the fuel property as a time in ticks.\n\nFuel is a short value, i.e.\n\na maximum of 32767 ticks, which is about 27 minutes.\n\nHowever, / summon furnace_minecart ~ ~ ~ {Fuel:32000} alone doesn't make it go since it doesn't have a direction.\n\nIt can be right-clicked on a track to give it a direction, or it can be summoned with the properties PushX and PushZ set, which are responsible for the direction.\n\nThe Motion property of every entity allows for movement of the minecart, but it does not direct the minecart to move on its own.\n\nJava Edition: Minecarts with furnaces use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n[sound 1]

Volume Beta called \"Eleven\", which has the same length of 1:11 and begins with the same vinyl static sound before being abruptly interrupted by a record scratching sound and switching to a new, calm piano piece.\n\nC418 once imagined that the \"monster\" chasing the person in \"11\" is himself \"being a weird monster that occasionally records songs from strangers and then dies in '11'\".\n\n[11] \"11\" causes jukeboxes to output a redstone signal strength of 11.\n\nBefore Java Edition 1.13, the data value of \"11\" was 11.\n\nBrandon Pearce stated that the warden mob is based on the \"monster\" heard at the end of \"11\".\n\n[12] The music disc \"wait\", originally titled \"where are we now\", was finally added to Java Edition 1.4.3 after existing solely in the game's files for an unspecified amount of time.\n\n\"wait\" used the original title \"where are we now\" in older versions of the Legacy Console Edition.\n\n\"Pigstep\" is the only disc to have its name capitalized in-game, and it can only be found in bastion remnants.\n\nIt is also the music disc with the fastest beat.\n\n\"Pigstep\" is a portmanteau of \"piglin\" and \"dubstep\".\n\n[13] \u201c5\u201d is the only music disc that is crafted, as it requires 9 disc fragments in a 3\u00d73 formation to craft.\n\nIn disc \u201c5\u201d, there are some sounds taken from Minecraft Dungeons of the Endersent https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:D6_sfx_mob_endersentIdleVocal-001.ogg, the Vengeful Heart of Ender https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:D6_sfx_mob_finalFormMagicChimes-004.ogg, and relating to an enderman https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Sfx_mob_eventEnderman2D-001.ogg.\n\nOther sounds can be heard.\n\nIn order of appearance, these are: flint and steel clicking https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Flint_and_steel_click.ogg, a bat https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Bat_idle4.ogg https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Bat_takeoff.ogg https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Bat_loop.ogg, lava bubbling https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Lava.ogg, amethyst cluster breaking https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Amethyst_Cluster_break1.ogg, a sculk shrieker https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Sculk_shrieker_shriek1.ogg, stone https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Stone_hit6.ogg https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Stone_hit5.ogg https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Stone_hit4.ogg, sand https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Sand_hit1.ogg https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Sand_hit5.ogg, a sculk shrieker https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Sculk_shrieker_shriek1.ogg overlaying a warden https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Warden_ambient1.ogg, sculk sensor clicking https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Sculk_Sensor_sculk_clicking2.ogg, and a warden roaring https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Warden_roar5.ogg.\n\nMusic C418 Minecraft -

    "content": "This article is about the item that gives names to mobs.\n\nFor the nameplate above a player's head, see Player \u00a7 Username.\n\nName Tag Rarity Common Renewable Yes Stackable Yes (64) A name tag is an item used to name mobs in the world and prevent them from despawning naturally.\n\nName tags can be caught from fishing as part of the treasure category with a 1 \u2044 6 chance after the 5% chance of being a treasure catch.\n\nThe chance of catching treasure increases with the Luck of the Sea enchantment.\n\nMaster-level librarian villagers offer to sell a name tag for 20 emeralds as one of their available trades.\n\nTo use a name tag, it must first be renamed with an anvil, costing 1 experience level.\n\nIf it is not renamed, it has no effect when used on a mob.\n\nAfter the name tag is renamed, the player can use it on a mob to give it the name given to the name tag from the anvil.\n\nMobs and name tags can be renamed any number of times.\n\nName tags with the same name are stackable.\n\nOnce a mob is named, it keeps its name, and the name tag is consumed.\n\nWhen a mob is named, it is excluded from the mob cap count.\n\nEffects on various mobs: A named silverfish that goes into a block appears to lose its name because it is replaced by a newly generated unnamed silverfish when the block is broken.\n\nA baby (animal or villager) keeps its name when becoming an adult.\n\nA named villager keeps its name when transformed into a zombie villager.\n\nA named zombie villager keeps its name when cured.\n\nWandering traders still despawn even if they are named, or in a minecart or boat.\n\nA named wither 's boss bar displays its name instead of \"Wither\".\n\nNaming an ender dragon with commands also displays the name in the boss bar.\n\nAny mob can be named except for the ender dragon and players.\n\nA name tag can rename an armor stand, though it does not show the nameplate above its head until CustomNameVisible:1b is set as an extra step.\n\nUsing a name tag on a villager renames the villager instead of opening the trading interface.\n\nA saddled pig is renamed instead of being ridden.\n\nUsing a name tag on any other mob that can be interacted with performs the use action instead of being named.\n\nThese mobs can be renamed if the player uses the name tag while crouching or standing in a nether portal because the portal suppresses the use action.\n\nOnce a name tag is used on a mob, it is impossible to remove the name of that mob without the use of commands or external modifications.\n\nRenamed mobs have their name displayed over their head in the same fashion as a mob named through a renamed spawn egg.\n\nTheir names can be seen only if they are aimed at from four or fewer blocks away.\n\nMobs that are named using the name tag never despawn in the world, similar to tamed mobs.\n\n[1] The exceptions are wandering traders or if the mob is hostile and the difficulty is switched to \" Peaceful \", causing any hostile mobs or any named hostile mobs to despawn immediately.\n\nIf a renamed mob kills a player, the custom name is used in the death message in place of the mob type name.\n\nFor instance, if a vindicator named \"Johnny\" kills a player, the death message is \"Player was slain by Johnny\".\n\nA renamed wither also has a renamed health bar, and the boss bar doesn't regenerate [verify ].\n\nAny mob that receives the name \" Dinnerbone \" or \" Grumm \" is rendered upside down.\n\nThis even includes the player in early versions of Bedrock Edition if the username is set to either of these and you are not signed into Xbox Live.\n\nNaming a sheep \" jeb_ \" causes its wool to fade between the dye colors, producing a rainbow effect.\n\nThe wool that drops when the sheep is sheared or killed is the original color of the sheep before the sheep was named.\n\nNaming a rabbit \" Toast \" causes it to have a special memorial skin of user xyzen420's girlfriend's missing rabbit.\n\nNaming a vindicator \"Johnny\" causes it to be aggressive and attack all mobs including the wither (except ghasts and other illagers).\n\nThe hostility even extends to ravagers in Java Edition, as the \"Johnny\" vindicator can also attack the ravager while it's riding it.\n\nJava Edition: Bedrock Edition: Issues relating to \"Name Tag\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nName tags were added at the request of Paulsoaresjr.\n\n[2] [3] A stack of up to 64 name tags can be renamed at once.\n\nThe cost is 1 experience level per stack, regardless of how many name tags were stacked.\n\nTo name a mob \u201cName Tag\u201d the player must give the name tag a random name, then rename it back to \u201cName Tag\u201d.\n\nA villager with a name tag turned into a zombie villager by a zombie with a name tag does not despawn, but a villager with a name tag turned into a zombie by a zombie without a name tag does despawn.\n\nIt is impossible to have a rainbow sheep upside-down, because it is impossible for it to be named \u201cJeb_\u201d and \u201cDinnerbone\u201d at the same time.\n\nTo use a name tag, the player must first rename it using an anvil.\n\nA wolf that has been renamed using a name tag.\n\nA creeper renamed using the name tag.\n\nA wither renamed using a name tag.\n\nThe custom name takes place of \"Wither\" over the health bar as well.\n\nHow to use \"Grumm\" and \"Dinnerbone\" name tag easter egg and lead to make another animal Yo-yo.\n\nA horse using the \"Grumm\" or \"Dinnerbone\" easter egg to be rendered upside-down.\n\nName Tag found in a mineshaft chest.\n\nFirst image of a name tag in bedrock edition.\n\nSpawn Egg \u2191 https://twitter.com/Dinnerbone/status/327485109940916226 \u2191

    "content": "This article is about the raw potato.\n\nFor the cooked potato, see Baked Potato.\n\nFor the potato that can inflict poison, see Poisonous Potato.\n\nFor the joke snapshot, see 24w14potato.\n\nPotato Age 0-1 Age 2-3 Age 4-6 Age 7 Rarity Common Renewable Yes Stackable Yes (64) Restores 1 () A potato is a food item obtained from potato crops that can be used to plant them, consumed raw or cooked to make baked potatoes.\n\nPotato crops are planted in farmland and used to grow potatoes and, rarely, poisonous potatoes.\n\nVillage farm plots have a chance of being planted with potatoes.\n\nThe exact chance depends on the style of the village: Fully grown potato crops drop 2 to 5 potatoes (3 5 \u2044 7 per crop harvested on average) and have a 2% chance of dropping an additional poisonous potato.\n\nPotato yield can be increased using a tool enchanted with Fortune, with Fortune III harvesting an average of 5 3 \u2044 7 potatoes.\n\nBone meal can be used to mature the potato to its last stage of growth.\n\nThe first two potatoes always drop, and then three more attempts are made to drop a potato with a success rate of 57.14286% to yield the extra 0\u20133 drops.\n\nEach level of Fortune enchantment increases the number of attempts by one.\n\nZombies, husks, and zombie villagers have a 2.5% (1 \u2044 40) chance of dropping either an iron ingot, carrot, or potato when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nThis is increased by 1% (1 \u2044 100) per level of looting.\n\nThis gives potatoes the following chances of dropping: 1 \u2044 120 (about 0.83%) 7 \u2044 600 (about 1.17%) with Looting I 9 \u2044 600 (1.50%) with Looting II 11 \u2044 600 (about 1.83%) with Looting III If a zombie, husk, or zombie villager is killed with fire, it drops a baked potato instead.\n\nMain article: Tutorials/Crop farming When farmed, potatoes require 8 stages to grow.\n\nHowever, there are four visible stages due to having only four distinct textures: every two stages have the same texture, except that growth stage 7 keeps the same appearance as stages 5\u20136, so that only stage 8 has the final, mature appearance.\n\nPlanted potatoes require a light level of 9 or greater to continue growing.\n\nIf the light level is 7 or below, the crops instantly un-plant themselves (\"pop off\").\n\nIt is not possible to plant potatoes if the light level is too low.\n\nCrops grow faster if the farmland they are planted in is hydrated.\n\nUsing bone meal on crops also increases the speed of growth by randomly increasing their growth stage by 2 to 5.\n\nCrops break if pushed by a piston or if their supporting farmland breaks or turns to dirt (i.e.\n\nby being trampled), dropping their usual drops.\n\nTo eat a potato, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar.\n\nEating a potato restores 1 () hunger and 0.6 saturation.\n\nPigs follow and can be bred by a player holding a potato.\n\nVillagers can pick up potato items to become willing, which allow them to breed.\n\nVillagers require 12 potatoes to become willing.\n\nNovice-level farmer villagers have a 25% [Bedrock Edition only ] or 40% [Java Edition only ] chance to buy 26 potatoes for an emerald as part of their trade.\n\nPlacing a potato into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\n\nThis is less efficient than composting with baked potatoes, which has a higher success chance of 85%.\n\nJava Edition: \u2191 Unlike all other block placement sound events, these are listed under items.\n\nConfirmed to be intentional by Mojang, see MC-177459 \u2191 Can be 1.2 or 0.96 for each sound \u2191 a b MC-177082 Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: \u2191 Can be 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: \u2191 ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n\n\u2191 Unavailable with / give command \u2191 The block's direct item form has the same id as the block.\n\nSee also: Block states Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: The following content is transcluded from Technical blocks/Potatoes.\n\nJava Edition 12w34a - 14w21b: Potatoes Issues relating to \"Potato\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nAll the seeds that exist in the game (except pitcher pod, torchflower seeds, nether wart, and cocoa beans).\n\nCarrots and potatoes found growing naturally in a village.\n\nOfficial render of a potato to celebrate National Potato Day.\n\n[6] \u2191 MC-1680 \u2191 MC-50232 \u2191 MC-50155 \u2191 MC-199242 \u2191 MCPE-146936 \u2191 https://twitter.com/Minecraft/status/1692969488617029859?s=20%7C Hot potato!\n\n@ a friend to toss it.\n\nTaking Inventory: Potato \u2013 Minecraft.net on December 16, 2021 Items View at: Template:Items/content [edit ]",

[JE only ] Main article: Brewing Potions can be modified in five ways.\n\nBrewing glowstone dust into certain potions will enhance their level of effect.\n\nAdding redstone will extend the duration of the effect.\n\nBrewing gunpowder into a potion makes it into a splash potion (area effect).\n\nAdding dragon's breath to a splash potion creates a lingering potion (area effect that lingers on the ground).\n\nBrewing a fermented spider eye into specific potions modifies their effect, usually inverting it, which is referred to as \"corruption\".\n\nThe modifications of Enhancement and Extension are mutually exclusive.\n\nEnhancing most potions trades some of its duration for a bigger effect.\n\nFor example, the base Regeneration works for 44 seconds whereas Regeneration II lasts for only 22 seconds but heals more per tick during that time.\n\nExtending a potion generally makes it last 8 \u2044 3 as long as its base potion, so a duration of 3 minutes becomes 8 minutes.\n\nThe usual result of corruption is to invert the potion's effect (for example Swiftness becomes Slowness).\n\nInterestingly, corrupting Poison (continuous damage effect) creates a Potion of Harming, an instant damage effect, instead of the continuous healing effect (regeneration) one would normally expect.\n\nCorrupting a Potion of Night Vision turns it into a Potion of Invisibility rather than an inverse effect that might be something like blindness.\n\nCorrupting an extended or enhanced potion results in a corrupted potion with the same modifier, if it is supported by the corrupted effect.\n\nAll of the \"corrupted\" potions except Harming can be extended, but it is the only one that can be enhanced.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the corruption of Healing II or Poison II potions results in a potion of Harming I.\n\nBase potions are potions that have no effect when the player drinks them, but are necessary as the basis for other potions.\n\nIn Java Edition, the Uncraftable Potion is a potion with no effect that is unobtainable in regular gameplay.\n\nIt is also available in splash potion and lingering potion forms, as well as for tipped arrows.\n\nIt can be obtained using the following command: / give @s minecraft:potion{Potion:\"minecraft:empty\"}.\n\nIt is also obtained any time a potion has invalid or missing potion effect tags, and thus serves as a placeholder.\n\nThis section of the article is empty.\n\nYou can help by adding to it.\n\nThe effects given by Potions of Healing and Harming are opposite on undead mobs, which includes skeletons and zombies.\n\nPotions of Healing cause harm, and Harming heals them.\n\nIn addition, undead mobs are not affected by Poison or Regeneration.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, hitting an undead mob with a Regeneration Potion will always register as Regeneration I, no matter the level of the used potion.\n\nUsing a water bottle, splash water bottle, or lingering water bottle on dirt, coarse dirt, or rooted dirt will convert it into mud, returning a glass bottle with it.\n\nThis process can be automated with a dispenser.\n\nIn Bedrock and Legacy Console editions potion bottles may be used on a cauldron to fill it.\n\nUsing a glass bottle on a cauldron filled with a potion drains it and fills the bottle.\n\nPotions cannot be combined in a cauldron, nor can they be mixed with water, but as an added bonus if you use a stack of arrows in a full cauldron you get a stack of tipped arrows.\n\nfor 1 layer you get 16, 2 layers 32.\n\nIn Java Edition, potions can also be obtained with any status effect using / give and the tag custom_potion_effects, which is an array of effects for the potion.\n\nSee Item format#Potion Effects for more information, and status effect for a list of effects and IDs.\n\nJava Edition: \u2191

whether or not this effect produces particles.\n\nOptional, and defaults to true.\n\nshow_icon: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if effect icon is shown.\n\nfalse if no icon is shown.\n\nPotion: The name of the default potion effect.\n\nThis name differs from the status effect name.\n\nFor example, the value for an \"Instant Health II\" potion is \"minecraft:strong_healing\".\n\nA potion or tipped arrow getting its effects from this tag is named with the proper effect.\n\nThe default value is \"minecraft:empty\", which gives it the \"Uncraftable\" name.\n\nCustomPotionColor: The item uses this custom color, and area-of-effect clouds, arrows, and splash and lingering potions use it for their particle effects.\n\nThis color does not extend, however, to the particles given off by entities who ultimately receive the effect.\n\nThe numeric color codes are equal to the hex code of the color converted to a decimal number, or can alternatively be calculated from the Red, Green and Blue components using this formula: Red << 16 + Green <<8 + Blue.\n\nFor positive values larger than 0x00FFFFFF, the top byte is ignored.\n\nAll negative values produce white.\n\nNormal potions use an NBT \"Potion\" tag to indicate the potion type.\n\nThe values of the tag (to be prefixed with minecraft:) are: See Bedrock Edition level format/Item format.\n\nThis section is missing information about

Armor is a category of items that provide players and certain mobs with varying levels of protection from common damage types, and appear graphically on the wearer (excluding non-humanoid wearers).\n\nThese items include several different tiers of helmets, chestplates, leggings, and boots, which can each be placed in designated armor slots of a player's inventory for use.\n\nA full set of armor consists of 24 units of a given material.\n\nA turtle shell is a helmet with no corresponding armor pieces.\n\nDespite there being chain items, chainmail armor cannot be crafted.\n\nA full suit of Netherite armor needs 4 units of smithing templates and 4 units of Netherite ingots (16 netherite scraps and 16 gold ingots); obtaining netherite armor requires combining a diamond armor piece with a netherite ingot and smithing template using a smithing table.\n\nArmor can be repaired by placing two pieces of the same type (e.g., iron helmets) in a grindstone or in the crafting grid.\n\nThe resulting item has 5% more durability left than the original items combined, if the total durability of both of the armor pieces is more than the total durability that a piece of armor would have fresh from a crafting table, but any enchantments are lost.\n\nRepairing armor with an anvil preserves and combines the enchantments, with a rising experience cost for subsequent repairs on the same item.\n\nA piece of armor can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the armor material 's repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% of the armor item's maximum durability, rounded down.\n\nChainmail armor can be repaired in an anvil using iron ingots.\n\nNetherite armor can be repaired in an anvil using netherite Ingots.\n\nZombies, skeletons and their variants that spawn with armor have a small chance of dropping their armor when killed by the player.\n\nWhen killed, the armor they drop can vary from 0 to full durability.\n\nUpon death, zombies, zombie villagers, skeletons, zombified piglins, and wither skeletons always drop any armor that they picked up and equipped.\n\nThey may also be wearing enchanted armor that retains the enchantment when dropped.\n\nRarely, a mob can drop a chainmail armor item.\n\nThis is the only other way to obtain chainmail armor besides finding it in buried treasure or trading with villagers.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, pillagers and vindicators that spawn in raids have a small chance to drop an iron helmet, iron chestplate, iron leggings or iron boots, in a badly damaged state, with a possibility of having a random enchantment.\n\nIn Java Edition, armorer villagers throw chainmail armor to players who have the Hero of the Village status effect.\n\nTwo armor stands are found in each taiga village outdoor armory, one equipped with an iron helmet, the other with an iron chestplate.\n\nLeather armor can be bought from leatherworker villagers.\n\nThese armor pieces have randomly determined color.\n\nIron armor, chainmail armor and enchanted diamond armor can be bought from armorer villagers.\n\nPiglins may barter iron boots enchanted with Soul Speed when given a gold ingot.\n\nLeather boots, often badly damaged, can be obtained as a junk item from fishing.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a sealed room in woodland mansions can appear that has a chest always containing an Efficiency I leather cap or

the fourth level adds 16 percent of protection to the final calculation.\n\nIncreased toughness means less armor defense point reduction from strong attacks.\n\nMore information on this can be seen in \u00a7 Mechanics below.\n\nTo have any protective effect, armor must be worn by the player.\n\nA helmet, chestplate, leggings, and boots are equipped by placing them in the head, chest, legs and feet slots of the inventory next to the player 's character, respectively.\n\nArmor can also be equipped by right clicking while held.\n\nIf the respective slot already contains a piece of armor, they are swapped, and the original armor ends up in the player's hand.\n\nA chestplate provides the most protection per unit of material, followed by leggings.\n\nFor leather, iron, and diamond armor, boots have equivalent armor points as the helmet, but for chainmail and gold armor, the helmet trumps boots.\n\nA turtle shell, in addition to providing protection, also gives the player the Water Breathing status effect.\n\nEach armor piece consumes one inventory slot.\n\nThey cannot be stacked.\n\nIf wearing any piece of gold armor, Piglins become neutral towards the player, however Piglin Brutes remain hostile.\n\nIf wearing any piece of leather armor, a player is immune to freezing damage and FOV change.\n\nIf wearing leather boots, players may walk on powder snow.\n\nThis grants the \"Light as a Rabbit\" achievement.\n\nMain article: Armor materials There are seven different types of materials of armor, including turtle shells.\n\nThe six full sets are shown below in order from weakest (offers the least protection and is the least durable) to strongest (offers the most protection and is the most durable).\n\nLeather (on Steve) Golden (on Steve) Chainmail (on Steve) Iron (on Steve) Diamond (on Steve) Netherite (on Steve) Leather (on Alex) Golden (on Alex) Chainmail (on Alex) Iron (on Alex) Diamond (on Alex) Netherite (on Alex) The Turtle Shell is not part of a full set.\n\nHowever, its defense points match gold, chainmail, and iron helmets, while its durability is between iron and diamond helmets (276).\n\nIn the game's code, its protection is equivalent to iron armor.\n\nCertain items provide beneficial effects when worn, but provide no protection against damage.\n\nA carved pumpkin can be worn in the helmet slot.\n\nIt partially blocks the player's vision, but prevents endermen from becoming aggressive when the player looks at them.\n\nMob heads can be worn in the helmet slot.\n\nThey cut a player's detection range by 50% for the corresponding mob, a bonus that stacks with potions of Invisibility and sneaking.\n\nElytra are worn in the chestplate slot, allowing the wearer to glide through the air.\n\nMain article: Dye \u00a7 Dyeing armor Leather armor can be dyed, and colors can be mixed.\n\nDefault color HEX code for leather armor is #A06540.\n\nSince the 1.20 \"Trails and Tails\" update, armor trims can be applied to armor through the Smithing Table.\n\nThese are cosmetic changes to the armor that are found in a variety of structures.\n\nWhenever a piece of armor absorbs damage for the player, the armor itself is damaged, reducing its durability.\n\nAfter taking enough damage, the armor piece is completely destroyed.\n\nNote that if the damage is absorbed not by the armor itself, but by a protection enchantment of the armor, the armor is not damaged.\n\nEnchantments can also reduce the damage that armor normally does not reduce.\n\nThe following types of damage are reduced by armor and, consequently, damage the armor itself: Direct (melee) attacks from mobs and players.\n\nThis includes the Strength and the Weakness effects and damage-increasing enchantments.\n\nGetting hit with an arrow, a shulker bullet or a thrown trident.\n\nThis includes extra damage from enchantments (except shulker bullets).\n\nGetting hit with a fireball from a ghast or blaze, or a fire charge.\n\nLaser beam of a guardian or an elder guardian.\n\nDamage from Thorns enchantment, or spikes of guardians and elder guardians.\n\nTouching a damaging block (fire, lava, magma block, cactus or sweet berry bush).\n\nThis excludes netherite armor which is not damaged by fire-related sources.\n\nTouching a pufferfish.\n\nExplosions.\n\nFireworks with at least a firework star in the recipe.\n\nLightning.\n\nGetting hit with a falling anvil.\n\nGetting hit with a snowball from a player  [upcoming: JE Combat Tests ] or snow golem.\n\n[more information needed ] Getting hit with an egg from a player  [upcoming: JE Combat Tests ] [more information needed ] The following types of damage are not reduced by armor and have no effect on the armor itself: Ranged sonic attacks from wardens.\n\nFall damage (including ender pearls, but Protection and Feather Falling enchantments reduce it).\n\nOngoing damage from being on fire.\n\nSuffocating inside a block or due to entity cramming (also includes the world border).\n\nDrowning in water (partially for turtle shells).\n\nStarvation.\n\nColliding with a block while flying with elytra.\n\nMagic (Evoker fangs, status effects and instant damage from a potion of Harming or Dragon's Breath) (but Protection does reduce magical damage.) Poison damage.\n\nFalling into the void or / kill.\n\nBeing inside of a powder snow block.\n\nThis excludes if the player or mob wears any piece of leather armor.\n\nThe armor bar as shown in game Armor defense points are controlled by an attribute, generic.armor.\n\nThe player 's current protection level is represented visually by the armor bar.\n\nThe armor meter is affected by the particular pieces that are worn as well as the tier of the armor.\n\nThe following table shows the number of defense points added by default by each individual piece of armor, as well as the total points added by a full set of armor for each material.\n\nDifferent combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.\n\nArmor can further protect the player through a second attribute, generic.armor_toughness.\n\nNormally, armor nullifies a lesser portion of damage from attacks that deal greater damage.\n\n[2] Armor toughness resists this effect, mitigating the power of strong attacks.\n\n[3] By default, only diamond and netherite armor provide toughness, with each piece granting +2 toughness for diamond and +3 for netherite.\n\nDifferent combinations of armor provide different levels of armor toughness.\n\nArmor toughness system includes a new formula for calculating damage: t o t a l D a m a g e = d a m a g e \u00d7 (1 \u2212 max (d e f e n s e P o i n t s 5, d e f e n s e P o i n t s \u2212 4 \u00d7 d a m a g e t o u g h n e s s + 8) 25) {\\displaystyle \\mathsf{totalDamage} = \\mathsf{damage}\\times \\left(1 - \\frac{\\text{max}\\left(\\frac{\\mathsf{defensePoints}}{5}, \\mathsf{defensePoints} - \\frac{4\\times\\mathsf{damage}}{\\mathsf{toughness}+8} \\right)}{25} \\right)} See also: Armor/Bedrock Edition Damage taken depends on the number of defense points, the toughness of the armor worn and the strength of the attack.\n\nd a m a g e = w e a p o n d a m a g e \u00d7 (1 \u2212 min (20, max (d e f e n s e p o i n t s 5, d e f e n s e p o i n t s \u2212 4 \u00d7 w e a p o n d a m a g e t o u g h n e s s + 8)) 25) {\\displaystyle \\mathsf{damage}=\\mathsf{weapon\\ damage}\\times\\left(1-\\frac{\\min\\left(20,\\max\\left(\\frac{\\mathsf{defense\\ points}}{5},\\mathsf{defense\\ points}-\\frac{4\\times\\mathsf{weapon\\ damage}}{\\mathsf{toughness}+8}\\right)\\right)}{25}\\right)} (Note: the min and max operators mean that only the minimum or maximum output of the two expressions that follow them (separated by commas) is used.\n\nfor example, \"y = min (2x, 16)\" means that \"y\" is equal to the smallest value out of \"2x\" and \"16\", while the largest is ignored.) Broken down, this means that each armor point gives 4% maximum damage reduction against an incoming attack.\n\nWithout toughness, this max damage reduction is lessened by 2 percentage points for each hit point of the incoming attack.\n\n2 defense points are worth 8% protection, so the total protection that can be achieved with armor is 80%.\n\nDiamond and netherite armors protect the player from up to 80% of damage, iron provides up to 60% damage reduction and leather provides up to 28%.\n\nOne piece of diamond armor (granting +2 toughness) decreases the defense reduction value for each attack hit point to 1.6%.\n\nTwo diamond pieces decrease it to 4 \u2044 3 % (about 1.3333%), three decrease it to 8 \u2044 7 % (about 1.1428%), and four decrease it to 1%.\n\nNetherite armor decreases this even further.\n\nOne piece of netherite armor reduce the defense reduction value for every hit point to 16 \u2044 11 (about 1.4545%), two decrease it to 8 \u2044 7 (about 1.1428%), three decrease to 16 \u2044 17 (about 0.9412%) and four decrease it to 0.8%.\n\nThe exact formula for the defense reduction in percent is: d e f e n s e r e d u c t i o n i n p e r c e n t = 16 \u00d7 d a m a g e t o u g h n e s s + 8 {\\displaystyle \\mathsf{defense\\ reduction\\ in\\ percent} = \\frac{16 \\times \\mathsf{damage}}{\\mathsf{toughness}+8}} Simply put, as toughness increases, the amount of defense reduction done by high-damaging attacks is diminished, and as toughness approaches a high value (through commands), the defense reduction caused by high-damaging attacks becomes negligible.\n\nThe final damage reduction value of the armor is capped at a minimum of 0.8% damage reduction per armor point, and to a maximum of 80% total.\n\nIf armor is cheated in so that the min cap is larger than the max cap, the min cap is ignored.\n\nAn illustration of the armor reduction is given below.\n\nIn tabular form (with a toughness of 0), damages are: Note that these damage values are lower if a player wears pieces of diamond armor or has toughness added to the armor through commands.\n\nWithout using cheats, armor values of 16 and above are impossible to obtain without at least one piece of diamond or netherite armor.\n\nEach netherite armor piece gives 10% of knockback reduction, protecting 40% with a full set.\n\nSee also: Enchanting Armor can be enchanted to provide various enchantments.\n\nEnchantments can provide more protection or allow armor to protect certain types of damage that armor doesn't normally protect against, such as fall damage or fire.\n\nDamage reduction from enchantments does not decrease the armor's durability.\n\nArmor enchantments do not appear on the armor bar.\n\nAn armor's material determines how enchantable it is.\n\nThe higher a material's enchantability, the greater the chances of getting multiple and high-level enchantments (see enchantment mechanics for details).\n\nAs with several enchantments, several different levels of protection are possible.\n\nThe maximum level of a protection enchantment is currently IV (4).\n\nProtection enchantments from multiple pieces of armor stack together, up to a calculated maximum.\n\nEach protection enchantment protects against specific types of damage.\n\nThe amount of damage reduction depends on the Enchantment Protection Factor (EPF) provided by that enchantment.\n\nWhen a player or mob wearing armor is subjected to damage, the EPFs of all applicable enchantments are added together, capped at 20, and then damage reduction is cappedEPF / 25, giving a maximum reduction of 20 \u2044 25 (80%) at EPF 20.\n\nBecause of the caps in the calculation, it is possible to achieve maximum protection against specific types of damage with just three pieces of armor.\n\nFor example, two pieces of armor with Blast Protection IV (EPF 8 each) and a single piece with Protection IV (EPF 4) would give a total EPF of 20 versus explosions.\n\nAny additional EPF would be wasted against explosions (but might be useful against other types of damage, if applicable).\n\nIf the damage is of a type that armor protects against normally, this reduction applies only to the damage that got through the armor.\n\nIt is possible using / give to obtain armor with an enchantment level higher than what is normally obtainable via normal survival.\n\nUsing this method, a player could give themselves, for example, a full set of diamond armor with a Protection V enchantment on every piece.\n\nFollowing the algorithm above, we find that, because Protection V has an EPF of 5, the armor reaches the maximum EPF of 20 for all types of damage.\n\nAny higher Protection enchantments could be used to reach the cap with just one level XX (20) enchantment, rather than having a full set of enchanted armor, but would be wasted if all pieces shared the same level enchantment.\n\nThe table below shows all armor enchantments at their max levels: Note: Only one form of protection can be applied to a piece of armor (i.e.\n\na chestplate cannot have both Fire Protection and Blast Protection, unless using commands to get all protection enchants in one piece of armor).\n\nFeather Falling, Frost Walker, Depth Strider and Soul Speed are enchantments applicable only to boots.\n\nRespiration and Aqua Affinity are enchantments applicable only to helmets.\n\nSwift Sneak is enchantment applicable only to leggings.\n\nAny hit from a damage source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of durability from each piece of armor worn for every 4 of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1).\n\nThe following chart displays how many hits each piece of armor can endure.\n\nThe chart below shows the durability per unit of material for each piece of armor, compared to that of the boots.\n\nNote that the durability per unit does not depend on the tier of the armor.\n\nThis means that for the same number of leather / iron ingots / gold ingots /chainmail/ diamond, boots can take 1.5 more damage than leggings.\n\nThus, chestplates and leggings offer more defense points per unit, but have less durability per unit.\n\nArmor worn by a non- player mob does not lose durability when attacked by any means.\n\nHelmets that are worn by undead mobs lose durability when exposed to sunlight due to absorbing the mob's damage from sunlight.\n\nNetherite armor does not lose durability from lava or fire damage.\n\nCertain mobs can spawn equipped with random armor pieces.\n\nSome mobs also spawn with the ability to pick up the armor on the ground and equip them.\n\nThe probability of mobs spawning equipped with armor, whether the armor is enchanted, the level of the enchantment of the armor, and how many pieces of armor a mob spawns with depends on the difficulty; if a mob spawns with armor, the tier of armor (leather, gold, etc.) has a fixed probability: It is impossible for zombies and skeletons to naturally spawn with netherite armor.\n\nThe protection provided by armor and armor enchantments works the same with mobs as it does with players.\n\nThe following mobs can spawn with armor: Zombie Baby Zombie Zombie Villager Baby Zombie Villager Husk Baby Husk Skeleton Stray Piglin [4] The following do not naturally spawn with armor, but they do pick up dropped armor on normal or hard difficulty: Drowned Baby Drowned Zombified Piglin Baby Zombified Piglin Wither Skeleton Zombie Villager Baby Zombie Villager The following do not naturally spawn with armor, but they do pick up dropped armor and their armor does not render: Fox Baby Fox These mobs can have armor equipped on them via dispensers, but do not pick up armor: Piglin Brute These mobs can have armor equipped on them via dispensers, but their armor does not render: Villager Baby Villager These mobs cannot wear armor through survival mode means, but if equipped with commands, their armor is visible: Giant Pillager Vindicator Evoker All other mobs can be equipped via commands, although the armor cannot be seen.\n\nHelmets can protect mobs from burning in sunlight, depleting its durability as it absorbs the damage.\n\nEventually, the helmet loses all of its durability and breaks.\n\nPumpkins, mob heads, or anything placed into the head slot using commands, also protect mobs from burning in sunlight.\n\nDamage caused by any other source does not cause the mob's armor durability to decrease.\n\nLeather (on a zombie, or giant) Golden (on a zombie) Chainmail (on a zombie) Iron (on a zombie) Diamond (on a zombie) Netherite (on a

players and mobs.\n\nArrows shot by players can always be picked up in Creative mode.\n\nAn arrow cannot be picked up by a player in Survival or Adventure mode if: It is shot by a player in Creative mode.\n\nIt is shot by any mob able to shoot arrows, such as skeletons, strays, pillagers, or piglins.\n\nThis includes mobs that do not shoot arrows in normal gameplay, such as illusioners and bow-wielding wither skeletons.\n\nThis is the case even in Creative mode.\n\n[1] It is shot with an Infinity -enchanted bow.\n\nIt is one of the two extra arrows shot with a Multishot -enchanted crossbow.\n\nSkeletons and strays drop 0-2 arrows upon death.\n\nThe maximum drop is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0\u20135 arrows with Looting III.\n\nStrays have a 50% chance of dropping 1 arrow of Slowness when killed by a player.\n\nEach level of Looting increases the chance of this drop by 50% of the previous chance.\n\nThis results in a maximum of 93.75% with Looting III.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, pillagers also drop 0\u20132 arrows upon death.\n\nThe maximum drop is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-5 arrows with Looting III.\n\nNovice-level fletcher villagers have a 50% chance in Bedrock Edition, or a 2 \u2044 3 chance in Java Edition, to sell 16 arrows for one emerald as part of their trades.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, master-level fletcher villagers have a 1 \u2044 2 chance to sell 5 tipped arrows for 2 emeralds and 5 arrows.\n\nIn Java Edition, they have a 2 \u2044 3 chance to sell 5 tipped arrows for 2 emeralds and 5 arrows.\n\nTrades in Java Edition can be the base effect, level II, or extended; in Bedrock Edition, only the arrow of decay is level II.\n\nArrow of Fire Resistance Arrow of Harming Arrow of Healing Arrow of Invisibility Arrow of Leaping Arrow of Night Vision Arrow of Poison Arrow of Regeneration Arrow of Slowness Arrow of Strength Arrow of Swiftness Arrow of the Turtle Master Arrow of Water Breathing Arrow of Weakness Arrow of Slow Falling  [Java Edition only ] Arrow of Decay  [Bedrock Edition only ] These are all potion effects except Slow Falling in Bedrock Edition and Luck in Java Edition.\n\nTrading is the only legitimate way to obtain arrows of Decay in Survival mode.\n\nSpectral arrows [Java Edition only ] /normal arrows [Bedrock Edition only ] can be obtained through bartering with piglins, and have a ~8.71% chance to give the player 6-12 arrows.\n\nIn Java Edition, any regular or tipped arrow (except for Luck and Bad Luck arrows) can be obtained as a reward item from fletcher villagers when the player has the Hero of the Village status effect.\n\nArrows stuck in a block that were originally shot by dispensers or by players in Survival without the Infinity enchantment may be collected.\n\nArrows originally shot by skeletons, strays, illusioners, pillagers, piglins, players in Creative, players using the Infinity enchantment, or duplicate arrows created by Crossbows with the Multishot enchantment cannot be collected.\n\nArrows cannot be retrieved when they are stuck in a player or mob, and players or mobs do not drop them when killed.\n\nRetrievable arrows have a despawn timer of 60 seconds.\n\nMain article: Cauldron \u00a7 Potions In Bedrock Edition, tipped arrows can also be obtained by using arrows on cauldrons that contain potions.\n\nThe number of tipped arrows created depends on the potion inside the cauldron.\n\nWhen the cauldron is 1 \u2044 3 full, 16 arrows can be tipped.\n\nWhen the cauldron is 2 \u2044 3 full, up to 32 arrows can be tipped and when the cauldron is full, an entire stack of 64 arrows can be tipped.\n\nThis is more efficient than using lingering potions as up to 21 and 1/3 arrows can be tipped per potion.\n\nSee also: Bow When fired, arrows fly in a ballistic trajectory affected by gravity and drag in air, water, and lava.\n\nThe arrow's velocity is multiplied by 0.99 every game tick, and it also experiences 20 block/s 2 of downward acceleration induced by gravity.\n\nArrows travel approximately 3 blocks when fired parallel to a flat plane with no charge, 15 blocks average with medium charge, and 24 blocks average with maximum charge.\n\nWhen fired from a fully charged bow, arrows can travel 120 blocks if fired from an optimal angle.\n\nThe maximum height an arrow fired by a bow can reach is around 66 blocks.\n\nAn arrow fired in water experiences much more drag than in air: it moves less than 8 blocks before completely losing horizontal speed and falling straight down, although the knockback of the arrow remains unaffected.\n\nIt also leaves a trail of bubbles in its wake.\n\nThere is a random variable to the trajectory of an arrow, given by this.rand.nextGaussian() * 0.0075 * (double)inaccuracy for the x, y, and z coordinate.\n\nThe inaccuracy is relatively small, becoming noticeable over larger distances.\n\nThe inaccuracy of different arrow delivery devices may differ.\n\nDispensers fire with an inaccuracy of 6, while bows fire with an inaccuracy of 1.\n\nAn arrow's speed determine the damage it inflicts.\n\nThe damage inflicted is calculated by multiplying the arrow's damage value with its velocity in blocks per game tick.\n\nWhen fired from a fully-charged unenchanted bow, arrows do 6 of damage, with a smaller chance to damage for up to 11 \u00d7 5.5 via critical hits.\n\nThey inflict up to 5 damage from a medium-charged bow, and 1 from a bow with no charge.\n\nArrows fired from dispensers always do 3 of damage unless their velocity is modified by an external source.\n\nArrows fired from crossbows do 6 to 11 \u00d7 5.5 of damage.\n\nArrows trigger damage immunity on hit.\n\nHowever, unlike other methods of damage that may bypass invulnerability under certain conditions, arrows hitting the mob while it is invulnerable lose all speed and drop to the ground, dealing no damage unless they contact another mob.\n\nAn arrow shot into a tree.\n\nArrows also stick into objects they come in contact with and remain there for one minute before disappearing; the distance from the object and the angle determine how far into the target the arrow penetrates.\n\nSuch arrows may be retrieved.\n\nIf the arrow has any custom potion effects (NBT tag CustomPotionEffects), all potion effects, including vanilla potion effects (NBT tag Potion) are removed 30 seconds after the arrow stops moving.\n\nIf an arrow is stuck in a block, and that block is broken or disappears (e.g., leaves upon decay), then the arrow falls straight down and damages entities below, but never deals a critical hit.\n\nThe 1-minute despawn timer is then refreshed, meaning it will take another minute for the arrow to despawn.\n\nArrows bounce off players and mobs immune to damage, like a player in Creative mode, a wither under the \"wither armor\" effect, and a perching ender dragon.\n\nArrows shot through lava or (if there's at least a 2 block gap) fire catch on fire and show an appropriate animation until they pass through water.\n\nLike arrows shot from a bow with the Flame enchantment, they can set other entities they hit on fire for 5 seconds as well as ignite TNT and campfires.\n\nAn arrow shot at any kind of boat [JE only ], boat with chest [JE only ], or minecart causes the vehicle to break, dropping any components (including container contents).\n\nArrows can get visually stuck in players in Java Edition, although not any mobs.\n\nThey appear as regular arrows regardless of type.\n\n[2] Steve got shot.\n\nAlex got shot.\n\nAn arrow can activate a wooden button, wooden pressure plate, a tripwire, or a target.\n\nAn arrow will continue to power these blocks until it is removed or moved out of the \"activation zone\", either due to despawning, or being picked up.\n\nTarget blocks emit a redstone pulse for one second, as opposed to the static depressed state of the other switches.\n\nNon-wooden switches are not affected by arrows.\n\nWhen arrows are fired into the sides of blocks, they change their orientation to point more downward than their original flight path might indicate.\n\nThis can cause them to intersect and thus trigger switches above them that they didn't actually hit, or block rails above them.\n\nArrows are affected by explosions while they are in flight.\n\nSince explosions can increase the speed of an arrow, they can also increase the damage dealt by them.\n\n [Java Edition only ] See also: \u00a7 Crafting Tipped arrows are arrows that imbue a potion effect when hitting a mob or player.\n\nThe duration of the effect is 1 \u2044 8 that of the corresponding potion, if applicable, and is not affected by the power of the arrow.\n\nThe status effect is the same as the regular power effect for the potion.\n\nIf a bow is enchanted with Infinity, tipped arrows are still consumed.\n\nThe types of arrows are: Arrow of Regeneration Arrow of Swiftness Arrow of Fire Resistance Arrow of Healing Arrow of Night Vision Arrow of Strength Arrow of Leaping Arrow of Invisibility Arrow of Poison Arrow of Weakness Arrow of Slowness Arrow of Harming Arrow of Water Breathing Arrow of Luck  [JE only ] Arrow of Decay  [BE only ] Arrow of the Turtle Master Arrow of Slow Falling Arrow of Weaving Arrow of Infestation Arrow of Wind Charging Arrow of Oozing Arrows of Harming (and arrows of Healing when used against undead mobs) do not add a static amount of damage to the arrow.\n\n[3] Instead, the arrow's damage is first calculated, then checked to see if it is below 12 \u00d7 6.\n\nIf the arrow's damage is less than 12, the Harming effect of the arrow makes up the difference, to ensure the arrow does exactly 12 \u00d7 6.\n\nTherefore, an unenchanted bow cannot deal more than 12 damage using Harming (or Healing) arrows, as it can deal a maximum of 11 \u00d7 5.5 damage on level ground.\n\nHowever, if the arrow would deal more than 12 damage, the harming effect is entirely neutralized.\n\nThis means that bows enchanted with Power I through Power III has a chance to not utilize the arrow at full charge, and any Power level above III never utilizes Arrows of Harming effectively at full charge when against unarmored mobs or players.\n\nIt is possible to craft tipped arrows using lingering water bottles as well as Awkward, Thick, and Mundane lingering potions.\n\nIf crafted with a water bottle, the arrow is called an arrow of Splashing.\n\nIf crafted with Mundane, Awkward, or Thick potions, it is called a tipped arrow.\n\n[4] Tipped arrows crafted from different potions do not stack, as resultant tipped arrows all have different potion tags.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, all four kinds as well as the long mundane tipped arrow aren't obtainable either in creative, by cauldrons, by crafting, or by commands.\n\nAll four kinds generate blue particles in flight and upon landing, but otherwise behave like regular arrows.\n\nIn particular, arrow of Splashing has no effect on fire and campfires and when shot from a bow with the Flame enchantment, can light campfires and TNT just like regular arrows on fire.\n\nIn Java Edition, the uncraftable tipped arrow is a tipped arrow with no effect that is unobtainable in regular gameplay.\n\nIt is available in two variants that don't stack together: / give @s

differ from regular arrows in behavior when used as a projectile.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Java Edition.\n\nA spectral arrow confers the Glowing status effect for 10 seconds.\n\nThe Glowing effect creates an outline of the target, which is visible through blocks, and colored based on the target's team (white by default).\n\nEven if a bow is enchanted with Infinity, spectral arrows are still consumed.\n\nSpectral arrows can be acquired through bartering or crafted by combining 4 glowstone dust with one arrow, yielding 2 spectral arrows.\n\nJava Edition: Arrows and spectral arrows use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 Depends on how long the bow is charged for, around 1.2 with a fully charged bow.\n\nThe exact formula is 1 r a n

[Java Edition only ] If the firework rocket has no explosion effect, it deals no damage.\n\nThe explosion of a firework rocket deals 5 to 6 points of damage, with one firework star.\n\nThe explosion has a radius of roughly 4 blocks, which is unaffected by the firework star's effect.\n\nEach additional firework star on the rocket deals an additional 1 to 2 points of damage, for a maximum of 11 \u00d7 5.5 to 18 \u00d7 9 with 7 firework stars.\n\nThe flight duration of the firework increases the maximum range the firework can travel before exploding, but does not affect the damage output.\n\nLikewise, the damage remains the same regardless of any dyes used.\n\nUnlike an arrow shot from a bow, the firework does not slow down under water.\n\nFireworks crafted without firework stars shot from crossbows upon contact with terrains, slide on them.\n\nThey continue their original trajectories as soon as they break contact from the blocks they slid on.\n\nCrossbows can be repaired in an anvil or grindstone by combining two crossbows.\n\nAny loaded ammunition is retained from the crossbow in the first slot but sacrificed from the crossbow in the second slot.\n\nMultishot and Piercing are mutually exclusive.\n\nNormal methods of enchanting allow only one of them to be applied to a crossbow.\n\nCrossbows have a base enchantability of 1.\n\nEnchantments specific to crossbows include Quick Charge, Multishot and Piercing.\n\nCrossbows can be used as fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per crossbow.\n\nJava Edition: \u2191 quick1_3 occurs at half the frequency as the other sounds \u2191 0.325 for all except quick1_1 (pitch=0.9), which is 0.25 \u2191 quick1_1 can be 1.0 or 0.9; quick1_2 can be 1.0 or 0.95; quick1_3 can be 1.0 \u2191 a b _1 occurs at 2 \u2044 3 the frequency as the other sounds \u2191 a b 0.325 for all except _1 (pitch=0.95), which is 0.25 \u2191 a b _1 can be 1.0 or 0.95; _2 can be 1.0, 0.95, or 1.05; _3 can be 1.0, 0.9, or 1.05 \u2191 loading_middle4 occurs at 1 \u2044 4 the frequency as the other sounds \u2191 loading_middle1 can be 1.0, 0.95, or 1.2; loading_middle2 and loading_middle3 can be 1.0, 0.9, or 1.05; loading_middle4 can be 1.0 \u2191 a b MC-203146 \u2191 Multiplied by the loading percentage of the crossbow Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Main article: Player.dat format tag: The tag tag.\n\nChargedProjectiles: The items this crossbow has charged, normally one entry (three if enchanted with multishot): A charged item.\n\nTags common to all items Charged: If the crossbow is charged.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Item format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Crossbow\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nAlongside pillagers, crossbows were inspired by Minecraft Dungeons, even though they were added in the base game first.\n\n[2] Crossbows enchanted with Quick Charge VI and above get stuck on the first frame on the recharging animation because the resulting charge time is negative, and the game never reaches the time markers that tell it to advance the animation or the reloading procedure itself.\n\nIt is technically possible to charge such crossbows, but this would require overflowing the value that determines how long the crossbow has been charged.\n\nThis takes such an amount of time that this is practically impossible: for example, charging a crossbow with Quick Charge VI would take 69.4 years to complete.\n\nAlthough Piercing allows arrows to bypass shields, they can't get through the wither armor.\n\nThe crossbow's first-person loading animation in Bedrock Edition is different from Java Edition.\n\nEven if a crossbow is already wound with a projectile, when it drops on the ground, it always looks uncharged.\n\n[3] In real life, crossbows don't shoot the same arrows as bows, rather they shoot shorter, thicker, and oftentimes fletchless arrows (usually called \"bolts\") made to withstand the crossbow's increased power, which can shatter conventional arrows.\n\nA crossbow shown at MINECON Earth 2018.\n\nA pillager armed with a crossbow, shown at MINECON Earth 2018.\n\nHow the crossbow is equipped.\n\nAn enchanted crossbow.\n\nSteve charging crossbow in Java Edition.\n\nAlex charging crossbow in Java Edition.\n\nPillager charging crossbow.\n\nPiglin charging crossbow.\n\nThe Minecraft Dungeons variant of the crossbow \u2191 MC-111738 \u2191 \"March 2021 developper Q&A\" \u2013 discord.com, March 11, 2021.\n\n\u2191 MC-137552 Taking Inventory: Crossbow \u2013 Minecraft.net on October 20, 2022 Items View at: Template:Items/content [edit ]",

this decreases the radius by a 1 \u2044 2 block immediately, reducing the cloud's lifespan by 5 seconds.\n\nFor effects with duration, the duration applied by the cloud is 1 \u2044 4 that of the corresponding potion.\n\nFor effects without duration such as healing or harming, the potency of the effect is 1 \u2044 2 that of the corresponding potion.\n\nThe effect may be applied consecutively if the player or mob remains in the cloud.\n\nFor example, a player throwing the Lingering Potion of Healing II straight down consumes the cloud within a few seconds while being healed 5 times for a total of 20 \u00d7 10 health.\n\nAs far as healing is concerned, this makes the lingering potion much more powerful than the regular or splash potion, provided that the player is away from other mobs or players.\n\nLingering potions can also be thrown out of dispensers like splash potions.\n\nLike the splash water bottle, a lingering water bottle puts out fire and damages endermen and blazes by 1.\n\nIt creates no effect cloud.\n\nLingering water bottles can be used on dirt, coarse dirt, or rooted dirt to turn it into mud.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, using a lingering potion on a cauldron adds one level of that potion to the cauldron.\n\nAttempting to add a lingering potion to a cauldron with water, dyed water or a non-matching potion empties the cauldron and creates an explosion sound (but no actual explosion).\n\nIn Java Edition, the uncraftable potion is a splash potion with no effect that is unobtainable in regular gameplay.\n\nIt is also available in potion and splash potion forms, as well as for tipped arrows.\n\nIt can be obtained using the following command: / give @s minecraft:lingering_potion{Potion:\"minecraft:empty\"}.\n\nIt is also obtained any time a potion has invalid or missing potion effect tags, and thus serves as a placeholder.\n\nIn Java Edition, lingering potions can be obtained with any status effect using / give and the tag CustomPotionEffects, which is an array of effects for the potion.\n\nSee Item format#Potion Effects for more information, and status effect for a list of effects and IDs.\n\nJava Edition: Lingering potions use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: tag: The item's tag tag.\n\ncustom_potion_effects: The custom potion effects (status effects) this potion or tipped arrow has.\n\nOne of these for each effect.\n\nid: The resource location of the effect.\n\namplifier: The amplifier of the effect, with level I having value 0.\n\nNegative levels are discussed here.\n\nOptional, and defaults to level I.\n\nduration: The duration of the effect in ticks.\n\nValues 0 or lower are treated as 1.\n\nOptional, and defaults to 1 tick.\n\nambient: 1 or 0 (true/false) - whether or not this is an effect provided by a beacon and therefore should be less intrusive on the screen.\n\nOptional, and defaults to false.\n\nshow_particles: 1 or 0 (true/false) - whether or not this effect produces particles.\n\nOptional, and defaults to true.\n\nshow_icon: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if effect icon is shown.\n\nfalse if no icon is shown.\n\nPotion: The name of the default potion effect.\n\nThis name differs from the status effect name.\n\nFor example, the value for an \"Instant Health II\" potion is \"minecraft:strong_healing\".\n\nA potion or tipped arrow getting its effects from this tag is named with the proper effect.\n\nThe default value is \"minecraft:empty\", which gives it the \"Uncraftable\" name.\n\nCustomPotionColor: The item uses this custom color, and area-of-effect clouds, arrows, and splash and lingering potions use it for their particle effects.\n\nThis color does not extend, however, to the particles given off by entities who ultimately receive the effect.\n\nThe numeric color codes are equal to the hex code of the color converted to a decimal number, or can alternatively be calculated from the Red, Green and Blue components using this formula: Red << 16 + Green <<8 + Blue.\n\nFor positive values larger than 0x00FFFFFF, the top byte is ignored.\n\nAll negative values produce white.\n\nThrown lingering potion Behavior Does not exist Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: See also: Chunk format and Potion data values Lingering potions when thrown have entity data that define various properties of the entity.\n\nEntity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all projectiles Item: The item that was thrown.\n\nThe entity renders as a lingering potion if the id is lingering_potion, otherwise it renders as a splash potion.\n\nTags common to all potion items Area Effect Cloud Behavior Does not exist Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: See also: Chunk format The cloud that is created when: lingering potions are thrown;

this includes bamboo, despite that the sword is the fastest tool for breaking it.\n\n[1] If a sword is enchanted with Silk Touch, either using Creative or commands, cobwebs the sword destroys will drop the cobwebs themselves instead of the usual string.\n\nThis is due to the sword being classified as the proper tool for cobwebs.\n\nThe following table shows the time it takes to break blocks on which swords have any effect.\n\nColors indicate what gets dropped: White: an original block.\n\nBlue: block's normal drop (e.g.\n\nseeds, sapling, apple).\n\nRed: nothing.\n\nIn Creative mode, swords are unable to break blocks.\n\nHowever, care must still be taken around minecarts, paintings, item frames, [Java Edition only ] and armor stands; these are entities, thus can be broken with swords in Creative.\n\n[2] [3] Swords can receive, gathered from mob drops/villager trades or be found in various loot chests (example: End City, Bastion Remnant)with the following enchantments: Golden swords have the highest enchantability, yet the least durability \u2191 a b c Sharpness, Smite, and Bane of Arthropods are mutually exclusive.\n\nWooden swords can be used as fuel in furnaces, smelting 1 item per sword.\n\nPiglins are attracted to golden swords, run toward any golden swords on the ground and inspect it for 6 to 8 seconds before putting it in their inventory slot.\n\nJava Edition: \u2191 0.6 for strong1 through strong4, and 0.7 for strong5 and strong6 Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Main article: Blocking The blocking animation using a sword before and after Java Edition 14w30a (from the Adventure to the Bountiful updates).\n\nPreviously, since the Adventure Update, all types of swords could be used to parry to block some forms of damage.\n\nIf the player is blocking with a sword when attacked, the sword deflects 50% of incoming damage from melee, non-magical projectiles like arrows, and explosions, along with minimizing airborne knockback.\n\nThe sword is held in front of the player and its durability is not reduced by blocking.\n\nThe player moves at a slower rate than sneaking if blocking with a sword.\n\nSword blocks could be engaged and disengaged instantly, with no delay between the input and damage mitigation nor cooldown between lowering a block and raising a new one.\n\nAfter the Combat Update, the sword blocking functionality was replaced by blocking with shields and to accommodate the dual wield system.\n\nShields negate more damage and knockback than sword blocking from \"blockable\" attacks (they block 100% damage and knockback after Java Edition 1.11), but, unlike swords, they lose durability, have a 0.25 second startup period before damage can be mitigated and can be temporarily disabled by attacks with an axe.\n\nThe knockback dealt by swords used to be higher than while the players are using another melee items, like an axe or with the hands.\n\nThis feature was removed in Java Edition 1.9 and is also no longer used in Bedrock Edition.\n\nIssues relating to \"Sword\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe sword's traditional texture came from Notch 's abandoned RPG, Legend of the Chambered.\n\nThe iron sword's texture was created first, as it was from the game, and the other swords followed.\n\nIn Java Edition, with the introduction of netherite swords, it is possible to one-hit kill undead mobs in the game (except withers and zombies / skeletons with random armor) using a sword with the Smite V enchantment, without the need to perform a critical hit (this was previously possible only with a Smite V stone, iron, or diamond axe).\n\nPlastic diamond and enchanted swords are official Minecraft merchandise.\n\n[4] [5] In the game Transformice, a diamond sword can be found in the shop.\n\nEnchanted wooden sword.\n\nEnchanted stone sword.\n\nEnchanted iron sword.\n\nEnchanted golden sword.\n\nEnchanted diamond sword.\n\nEnchanted netherite sword.\n\nWooden sword in the Plastic Pack.\n\nStone sword in the Super Duper Graphics Pack.\n\nGold sword in the Natural Pack.\n\nPixel art of Alex fighting with a diamond sword in the Nether.\n\nAlex retrieving another diamond sword from a chest.\n\nThe Sinister Sword, a unique sword featured in Minecraft Dungeons.\n\nA nondescript sword as it appears in Minecraft Dungeons.\n\nA sword as it appears in Legend of the Chambered.\n\nOfficially licensed T-Shirt of a diamond sword.\n\nFoam replica of an iron sword.\n\n\u2191 MC-195168 \u2014 Swords consume double durability than they normally would when destroying bamboo saplings, bamboo, or cobwebs \u2191 MC-27140 \u2191 MC-18463 \u2191 https://shop.minecraft.net/products/minecraft-sword?_pos=1&_psq=sword&_ss=e&_v=1.0 \u2191 https://shop.minecraft.net/products/minecraft-enchanted-purple-sword?_pos=4&_psq=sword&_ss=e&_v=1.0 Items View at: Template:Items/content [edit ]",

[Bedrock Edition only ] Players can dye wool by placing wool and any dye in a crafting grid.\n\nDyes can be used on sheep to change the color of the wool.\n\nShearing a colored sheep drops the corresponding color of the wool, and the sheep retains the color when the wool regenerates.\n\nBreeding colored sheep produces a lamb colored as one of the parent sheep, or a color resulting from the combination of both parents' color.\n\nThe color combining follows the same rules that dyes use \u2013 red and yellow sheep produce an orange lamb, but a blue and yellow sheep cannot create a green lamb.\n\nThe unlimited reproduction of colored sheep makes dyeing and shearing sheep infinitely more efficient than just dyeing wool directly.\n\nDye can also be used on a tamed wolf or cat to change the color of its collar from the default red to the color of the dye.\n\nCarpets can be dyed.\n\nTerracotta can be dyed by placing 8 blocks around a dye on a crafting table.\n\nDyes can also be used to craft concrete powder, which can then be set into their respective concrete blocks (they cannot be dyed directly).\n\nStained glass can be stained by placing 8 blocks of glass around a dye on a crafting table.\n\nJust like regular glass, stained glass can be crafted into stained glass panes.\n\nThe recipe for this is the same as with regular glass.\n\nShulker boxes are generated in a light shade of purple (like the purpur block), but can be dyed any color.\n\nThey can also be re-dyed as often as desired.\n\nPlayers can dye beds by placing a bed and any color dye in a crafting grid.\n\nPlayers can dye candles by placing an undyed candle and any color dye in a crafting grid.\n\nMain article: Banner \u00a7 Patterns Dyes are used in most banner patterns to determine the pattern and color displayed.\n\nA graph showing all combinations of two dyes on a tunic.\n\nLeather armor and wolf armor can be dyed by: Crafting dyes with a piece of leather armor, leather horse armor, or wolf armor. [Java Edition only ] Dousing the leather armor, leather horse armor, or wolf armor in a cauldron to which dyes have been added. [Bedrock Edition only ] There are 5,713,438 [1] (34.1% of sRGB) colors leather armor and wolf armor can be, as it is possible to put more than one dye on the crafting table alongside the leather armor and the wolf armor.\n\nArmor can be dyed multiple times with previous colors affecting the final outcome.\n\nColored armor can be reverted to their original color using a cauldron with undyed water.\n\nThe game has a specific formula for calculating the color of dyed armor: each color, in the RGB color model, has a red value, green value, and blue value.\n\nFor each dye in the crafting grid, and the armor itself (if it is already dyed), the red, green, and blue values are added to running totals.\n\nIn addition, a running total of the highest value (be it red, green, or blue) is also kept.\n\nAfter this, each total is divided by the number of colors used.\n\nThis effectively produces the average red, green, blue, and maximum values.\n\nThe maximum value of the average RGB values is also calculated.\n\nFinally, each average RGB value is multiplied by the average maximum value and divided by the maximum of the average RGB values.\n\nThe modified average RGB values are then used as the final color.\n\nThis procedure can be summed up with the following equations: for each color (all \"total\" variables start at 0 before counting): totalRed = totalRed + redValue totalGreen = totalGreen + greenValue totalBlue = totalBlue + blueValue totalMaximum = totalMaximum + max(redValue, greenValue, blueValue) numberOfColors = numberOfColors + 1 averageRed = totalRed / numberOfColors averageGreen = totalGreen / numberOfColors averageBlue = totalBlue / numberOfColors averageMaximum = totalMaximum / numberOfColors maximumOfAverage = max(averageRed, averageGreen, averageBlue) gainFactor = averageMaximum / maximumOfAverage resultRed = averageRed * gainFactor resultGreen = averageGreen * gainFactor resultBlue = averageBlue * gainFactor Due to the way this formula works, the resulting color can never be darker than the average of the input colors and is often lighter and more saturated.\n\nOf course, the resulting color can never be lighter or more saturated than the lightest or most saturated input color.\n\nIn addition, this formula never creates an RGB value higher than 255 (which would be invalid in the 8-bit RGB color model).\n\nIf leather armor or wolf armor is renamed on an anvil, it retains its name when dyed or undyed.\n\nMixing Samples + = #FED83D + + = #C898BE + + = #B56D51 A firework star can have a single color or a combination of up to eight colors when crafted with dyes.\n\nAdding one or more dyes to a crafted firework star adds a \"fade to color\" effect to it, overwriting any existing fade colors.\n\nDye can be used to craft balloons.

Wither or poison inflicts up to 2 hearts damage.\n\nThe saturation effectively makes those stews a superfood: they restore up to 6 hunger and 12 saturation points on top of their food value, for a total of 12 (\u00d7 6) and over 19 points of saturation.\n\nPlacing a flower into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\n\nA stack of flowers yields an average of 5.94 bone meal.\n\nOak and birch trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of any flower have a 5% chance to grow with bee nest and 1-3 bees in it.\n\nJava Edition: \u2191 a b MC-177082 Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: \u2191 ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n\n\u2191 a b c d e f Available with / give command.\n\n\u2191 a b c d e f The block's direct item form has the same id as the block.\n\nSee also: Block states Java Edition: Sunflower, lilac, rose bush, and peony Bedrock Edition: All small flowers except dandelion Sunflower, lilac, rose bush, and peony First Image of a Paeonia.\n\nFirst Image of a Sunflower.\n\nCornflowers in a plains biome.\n\nIssues relating to \"Flower\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nWhen Notch made the dandelion (the texture in the Programmer Art pack), he used the rose as a base for its texture.\n\nPeonies were used at Jeb 's wedding, [8] and the Oxeye Daisy was named for his first game company, Oxeye Games Studio.\n\nRose bushes do not apply damage when walked through, despite roses having thorns.\n\nAllium is a genus composed of bulb vegetables such as onions, garlic, and related vegetables, which have large, pink inflorescences resembling that of the in-game flower.\n\nWither roses deal the same damage while in contact (and a second more) as magma blocks, via the Wither status effect.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, crimson and warped roots are in the \"Flower\" section of the inventory.\n\nUnlike both parts of its name suggests, the azure bluets are not blue in Minecraft.\n\nIn real life, their pale-blue color looks light grey at a distance.\n\nIn real life, cornflowers got their name because they used to be a common weed on crop fields.\n\n[9] Before they were added to Minecraft, white flowers were already present in Minicraft.\n\nTorchflowers are based off kniphofia genus of perennial flowering plants, which can be similarly called \"torch lilies\" as a common name.\n\n[10] This page would benefit from the addition of isometric renders.\n\nPlease remove this notice once you've added suitable isometric renders to the article.\n\nThe specific instructions are: Bedrock Edition model - it seems cross models no longer stretch their textures by the square root of 2 in Bedrock Edition Dandelion Poppy Blue Orchid Allium Azure Bluet Red Tulip Orange Tulip White Tulip Pink Tulip Oxeye Daisy Cornflower Lily of the Valley Wither Rose Torchflower Sunflower Lilac Rose Bush Peony Pitcher Plant Patches of flowers in a plains biome.\n\nFlowers in a forest biome.\n\nSunflowers naturally generated in a sunflower plains biome.\n\nFew small flower patches generated in a superflat world as a part of the village.\n\nLilacs growing in a forest.\n\nA strange-looking flower from an internal development build.\n\nThe plains flower gradient.\n\nThe flower forest flower gradient.\n\nThe Meadow flower gradient.\n\nA creeper being hurt by wither roses.\n\nFlowers generated around a lava lake.\n\nSome flowers have generated directly above the lava, in the air A poppy that generated floating in the air.\n\nA dandelion that generated deep underground.\n\nPeony found in a big cave system.\n\nA poppy generated next to lava underground.\n\n3 sunflowers found in abanonded mineshaft.\n\nA dandelion found in a mineshaft underground.\n\nA poppy which generated right next to lava in a cave near a mineshaft.\n\nThe upper half of a peony flower floating above a lake.\n\n\u2191 MC-154922 \u2191 MCPE-73842 \u2191 MC-159365 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 MC-29530 \u2191 MC-44467 \u2191 MC-260051 \u2191 MCPE-21049 \u2191 http://instagram.com/p/dE8ljlJMLb/ \u2191 \"Taking Inventory: Cornflower\" \u2013 Minecraft.net, November 24, 2022.\n\n\u2191 \"Ask Mojang\" \u2013 Minecraft on YouTube, October 27, 2023 Taking Inventory: Sunflower \u2013 Minecraft.net on November 2, 2018 Taking Inventory: Lilac \u2013 Minecraft.net on January 16, 2020 Taking Inventory: Cornflower \u2013 Minecraft.net on November 24, 2022",

Renewable Yes Stackable Yes (64) Tools Blast resistance 1 Hardness 1 Luminous No Transparent Yes Flammable Bamboo: Yes (60) Shoot: No Catches fire from lava Yes Bamboo is a versatile, fast-growing, bonemealable plant found primarily in jungles, which is used for crafting (particularly scaffolding and bamboo wood), smelting and breeding pandas.\n\nA bamboo shoot is the initial non-solid sapling form of planted bamboo.\n\nBamboo shoots cannot be obtained through vanilla means.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, they can be obtained through add-ons or inventory editing.\n\nIn Java Edition, they are completely unobtainable.\n\nBamboo can be mined with any tool, but a sword breaks the block instantly, even with Mining Fatigue.\n\nFlowing water also breaks bamboo shoots, but not mature bamboo stalks.\n\n\u2191 Times are for unenchanted tools as wielded by players with no status effects, measured in seconds.\n\nFor more information, see Breaking \u00a7 Speed.\n\nBamboo generates in widely scattered single shoots within jungle biomes.\n\nBamboo generates much more densely in the bamboo variants of jungles, covering large areas of the landscape.\n\nBamboo does not generate in sparse jungles.\n\n[1] In Java Edition, a panda drops 1 bamboo when killed.\n\nLooting does not affect the drop rate.\n\n[2] In Bedrock Edition, a panda drops 0-2 bamboo when killed.\n\nLooting increases the drop by 1 per level.\n\nBamboo can be found while fishing in jungle biomes as a junk item.\n\nWhen broken, any bamboo block placed or grown above it is also broken.\n\nA bamboo block drops itself as an item if a piston pushes it or moves a block into its space.\n\nWhen bamboo is first placed as a shoot it's not solid and can be destroyed by water flowing into it.\n\nAfter growing at least one block taller it becomes solid and can't be destroyed by water.\n\nTo transform a bamboo shoot into a solid bamboo block place another bamboo on top of it.\n\nUnlike most plants, bamboo cannot be composted.\n\n[3] Bamboo can be planted on moss blocks  [JE only ], grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, gravel, mycelium, podzol, sand, red sand, suspicious sand, suspicious gravel, mud, bamboo shoot, or on itself.\n\nAt default random tick speed (3), each plant grows on average every 4096 game ticks (204.8 seconds).\n\nWhen bone meal is used on it, it grows by 1\u20132 blocks.\n\nBamboo can grow up to 12\u201316 blocks tall.\n\nThe top of a bamboo plant requires a light level of 9 or above to grow.\n\nBecause bamboo breaks in almost the same way as sugar canes, a sugar cane farm can be easily adapted to this use.\n\nWhile water is not needed with such a farm, some spacing is recommended if the harvest is done manually as mature stalks are solid.\n\nBamboo items are eaten by pandas and can be used to speed up the growth of baby pandas.\n\nBamboo can also be used to breed pandas when at least 8 blocks of bamboo are within 5 blocks of the pandas, making the panda the only animal in the game to have extra breeding requirements.\n\nAt this point, the player can feed them bamboo and they mate to have a baby.\n\nBamboo can be used as fuel for smelting.\n\nEach bamboo item smelts 0.25 items.\n\nCrafting two bamboo into a stick and using that as fuel is equivalent, smelting 0.5 items.\n\nBamboo can be crafted into other items to increase its fuel efficiency.\n\nBy crafting 9 bamboo into 2 bamboo planks, 3 items can be smelted instead of 2.25, a 33.3% increase in efficiency.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the fuel efficiency can be further doubled by crafting the bamboo planks into twice the amount of slabs.\n\n[4] In Java Edition, by crafting 14 bamboo into 3 ladders, 4.5 items can be smelted instead of 3.5, a 28.6% increase in efficiency.\n\nBamboo can be placed in a flower pot, where it retains the design it has in its item form.\n\nThe different stages of bamboo growth.\n\nThe appearance of bamboo changes as it grows.\n\nWhen first placed, it takes the form of a small shoot, which has no hitbox.\n\nWhen it grows one block taller it grows to 2 pixels in length and width and the top block has leaves coming off it.\n\nAt 3 blocks, the top 2 blocks have leaves and at 4 blocks the bamboo expands to 3\u00d73 pixels.\n\nAt 5 blocks tall, the top 3 blocks have leaves on them.\n\nAs the bamboo grows, the leaves move up and stay at the top 3 blocks.\n\nDestroying a block of bamboo does not change the appearance of the blocks below it.\n\nBamboo is oriented at a random position in the block that it is in.\n\nJava Edition: \u2191 a b MC-177082 \u2191 1.0 for all except step2 and step4, which are 0.7 Bedrock Edition: \u2191 1.0 for all except step2 and step4, which are 0.7 Java Edition: \u2191 a b

[JE only ] Main article: Brewing Potions can be modified in five ways.\n\nBrewing glowstone dust into certain potions will enhance their level of effect.\n\nAdding redstone will extend the duration of the effect.\n\nBrewing gunpowder into a potion makes it into a splash potion (area effect).\n\nAdding dragon's breath to a splash potion creates a lingering potion (area effect that lingers on the ground).\n\nBrewing a fermented spider eye into specific potions modifies their effect, usually inverting it, which is referred to as \"corruption\".\n\nThe modifications of Enhancement and Extension are mutually exclusive.\n\nEnhancing most potions trades some of its duration for a bigger effect.\n\nFor example, the base Regeneration works for 44 seconds whereas Regeneration II lasts for only 22 seconds but heals more per tick during that time.\n\nExtending a potion generally makes it last 8 \u2044 3 as long as its base potion, so a duration of 3 minutes becomes 8 minutes.\n\nThe usual result of corruption is to invert the potion's effect (for example Swiftness becomes Slowness).\n\nInterestingly, corrupting Poison (continuous damage effect) creates a Potion of Harming, an instant damage effect, instead of the continuous healing effect (regeneration) one would normally expect.\n\nCorrupting a Potion of Night Vision turns it into a Potion of Invisibility rather than an inverse effect that might be something like blindness.\n\nCorrupting an extended or enhanced potion results in a corrupted potion with the same modifier, if it is supported by the corrupted effect.\n\nAll of the \"corrupted\" potions except Harming can be extended, but it is the only one that can be enhanced.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the corruption of Healing II or Poison II potions results in a potion of Harming I.\n\nBase potions are potions that have no effect when the player drinks them, but are necessary as the basis for other potions.\n\nIn Java Edition, the Uncraftable Potion is a potion with no effect that is unobtainable in regular gameplay.\n\nIt is also available in splash potion and lingering potion forms, as well as for tipped arrows.\n\nIt can be obtained using the following command: / give @s minecraft:potion{Potion:\"minecraft:empty\"}.\n\nIt is also obtained any time a potion has invalid or missing potion effect tags, and thus serves as a placeholder.\n\nThis section of the article is empty.\n\nYou can help by adding to it.\n\nThe effects given by Potions of Healing and Harming are opposite on undead mobs, which includes skeletons and zombies.\n\nPotions of Healing cause harm, and Harming heals them.\n\nIn addition, undead mobs are not affected by Poison or Regeneration.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, hitting an undead mob with a Regeneration Potion will always register as Regeneration I, no matter the level of the used potion.\n\nUsing a water bottle, splash water bottle, or lingering water bottle on dirt, coarse dirt, or rooted dirt will convert it into mud, returning a glass bottle with it.\n\nThis process can be automated with a dispenser.\n\nIn Bedrock and Legacy Console editions potion bottles may be used on a cauldron to fill it.\n\nUsing a glass bottle on a cauldron filled with a potion drains it and fills the bottle.\n\nPotions cannot be combined in a cauldron, nor can they be mixed with water, but as an added bonus if you use a stack of arrows in a full cauldron you get a stack of tipped arrows.\n\nfor 1 layer you get 16, 2 layers 32.\n\nIn Java Edition, potions can also be obtained with any status effect using / give and the tag custom_potion_effects, which is an array of effects for the potion.\n\nSee Item format#Potion Effects for more information, and status effect for a list of effects and IDs.\n\nJava Edition: \u2191

arrow has.\n\nOne of these for each effect.\n\nid: The resource location of the effect.\n\namplifier: The amplifier of the effect, with level I having value 0.\n\nNegative levels are discussed here.\n\nOptional, and defaults to level I.\n\nduration: The duration of the effect in ticks.\n\nValues 0 or lower are treated as 1.\n\nOptional, and defaults to 1 tick.\n\nambient: 1 or 0 (true/false) - whether or not this is an effect provided by a beacon and therefore should be less intrusive on the screen.\n\nOptional, and defaults to false.\n\nshow_particles: 1 or 0 (true/false) - whether or not this effect produces particles.\n\nOptional, and defaults to true.\n\nshow_icon: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if effect icon is shown.\n\nfalse if no icon is shown.\n\nPotion: The name of the default potion effect.\n\nThis name differs from the status effect name.\n\nFor example, the value for an \"Instant Health II\" potion is \"minecraft:strong_healing\".\n\nA potion or tipped arrow getting its effects from this tag is named with the proper effect.\n\nThe default value is \"minecraft:empty\", which gives it the \"Uncraftable\" name.\n\nCustomPotionColor: The item uses this custom color, and area-of-effect clouds, arrows, and splash and lingering potions use it for their particle effects.\n\nThis color does not extend, however, to the particles given off by entities who ultimately receive the effect.\n\nThe numeric color codes are equal to the hex code of the color converted to a decimal number, or can alternatively be calculated from the Red, Green and Blue components using this formula: Red << 16 + Green <<8 + Blue.\n\nFor positive values larger than 0x00FFFFFF, the top byte is ignored.\n\nAll negative values produce white.\n\nNormal potions use an NBT \"Potion\" tag to indicate the potion type.\n\nThe values of the tag (to be prefixed with minecraft:) are: See Bedrock Edition level format/Item format.\n\nThis section is missing information about Potion of Weakness;Uncraftable Potion texture in JE 1.11.\n\nPlease expand the section to include this information.\n\nFurther details may exist on the talk page.\n\nThick Potion with status effects

for several effects, along with their splash variants.\n\nThese effects are: Absorption, Blindness, Haste, Health Boost, Hunger, Mining Fatigue, Nausea, Resistance, Saturation, and Levitation, as well as the Luck potion textures also present in Java Edition.\n\nThese unused textures were added along with the other potion textures in Pocket Edition v0.12.1 alpha, except for the potion of levitation, which was added in Pocket Edition 1.0.0.\n\nThe textures were changed along with the other potion textures during the texture update in Bedrock Edition 1.10.0.\n\nStrangely, the potion of levitation

    "content": "This page describes content that exists only in outdated versions of Java Edition.\n\nThis feature used to be in the game, but has ever since been removed.It may or may not return in a future update.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition.\n\nInvalid Data Value Leaves Rarity Common Renewable No Stackable Yes (64) Invalid data value leaves are item forms of the primary leaves block with damage values outside of the usual range which leaves can usually be obtained in.\n\nThis section is missing information about MCPE-41408 indicates this may have been possible in Bedrock Edition at some point.\n\nPlease expand the section to include this information.\n\nFurther details may exist on the talk page.\n\nWithout the use of commands, invalid data value leaves are unobtainable in the last versions in which they existed without inheriting them from a prior version in which they were obtainable.\n\nInvalid data value leaves were obtainable by breaking leaves blocks placed in the world which had specific metadata values.\n\nWhen broken, the item would inherit the exact metadata that the block had, rather than be converted into one of the four valid states.\n\nThis can be done from Beta 1.9 Prerelease 6 onwards.\n\nThe bug allowing for this was fixed in 12w49a [1], making invalid data value leaves unobtainable from this version onwards.\n\nIn summary: A large amount of leaves with metadata 8, 9, 10 or 11, depending on the species of the tree in question, can be obtained by breaking the leaves of a naturally-generated or sapling-grown tree using a tool with the Silk Touch enchantment.\n\nThe first leaves block broken will always be of metadata 0, 1, 2 or 3, but the majority of subsequently broken leaves will return values 8, 9, 10 or 11.\n\nLeaves with metadata 12, 13, 14 or 15, depending on species, can be obtained in bulk by manually placing leaves in a large, connected fashion such as a cuboid, and then proceeding to break all of these with a Silk Touch tool.\n\nLeaves with metadata 4, 5, 6 or 7, depending on species, can be obtained in bulk by manually placing leaves in a spaced-out fashion, such that none of the placed leaves blocks are touching each other (even diagonally), and then breaking the blocks with a Silk Touch tool.\n\nWhen placing leaves for the latter two cases, it is recommended that valid data value leaves are placed, as the placement of invalid data value leaves has not been fully researched.\n\nThis section is missing information about check to see how the behavior changed in earlier and later versions.\n\nPlease expand the section to include this information.\n\nFurther details may exist on the talk page.\n\nIn 14w11b, [more information needed ] placed invalid data value leaves will always place leaves that do not decay.\n\nLeaves items with damage 4, 5, 6 and 7 will place leaves with metadata 4, 5, 6 and 7 respectively.\n\nSimilarly, items with damage 12, 13, 14 and 15 will place blocks with metadata 12, 13, 14 and 15.\n\nItems with damage 8, 9, 10 and 11 will respectively place blocks with metadata 12, 13, 14 and 15.\n\nIn 1.13 (17w47a) onwards, distinguishing between block and item variants using metadata and damage was formally abolished.\n\nAs a result of this, existing items would be converted over to the new ID system automatically.\n\nInvalid data value leaves behave anomalously in that instead of converting to their respective parent species, they all convert to oak leaves instead.\n\nDespite these items often being unknowingly collected and stored in older versions in such a way that conversion like this would end up being undesirable, Mojang have decided to not fix this [2].\n\nLeaves items with data values higher than 3, particularly oak leaves with a damage value of 4, [3] are often referred to as \"alpha leaves\".\n\nThis is a particularly egregious misnomer, as any of the twelve extreme data values can be obtained in versions as late as 1.4.5, with absolutely no involvement from Alpha or even Beta versions of the game.\n\nHow exactly this specific term reached common usage remains unknown, although it may be tied to the existence of \"alpha trees\", in which trees generated or grown before Java Edition Beta 1.2 would be comprised of multiple species of leaves if upgraded to this version or beyond, as metadata which was previously reserved for leaf decay was now used for distinguishing different species of leaves from each other.\n\nSimilarly confusingly, petrified oak slabs are sometimes referred to as \"alpha slabs\", despite the fact that the block was introduced in Beta 1.3, several months after the end of the Alpha era of the game.\n\nInventory appearances Metadata values above 16 Main article: /Unobtainable values

    "content": "This page describes content that exists only in outdated versions of Minecraft.\n\nThis feature used to be in the game, but has ever since been removed.It may or may not return in a future update.\n\nInvalid Data Value Wool Beta 1.2 1.0.0 1.8 Rarity Common Renewable Yes Stackable Yes (64) Invalid data value wool is a specific item form of wool with damage values outside of the usual range which wool can usually be obtained in, resulting in an unusual appearence.\n\nInvalid data value wool is currently not known to be obtainable without the use of commands, inventory editors or other such tools, in any version.\n\nInvalid data value wool is particularly notable due to its use of block textures in unexpected ways.\n\nFrom Beta 1.2 to Beta 1.8.1, as well as in early versions of Xbox 360 Edition, the item used the block placeholder texture, a texture only very rarely encountered in the unmodified game without the use of texture packs.\n\nFrom Beta 1.9 Prerelease to 13w01b, the item used the texture of newly-planted nether wart.\n\nThis bizarre texture usage can be easily be explained via analysis of terrain.png, a texture atlas used to store the texture of all blocks in the game prior to 1.5.\n\nAll 15 textures used by colored wool blocks can be found in a 2\u00d78 rectangle at the bottom left.\n\nThis rectangle, however, contained a sixteenth texture that was initially unused.\n\nWool with a damage value of 0 is white, and white wool's texture is located above this rectangle somewhat, and the game's code regards a damage value of 0 as a special case.\n\nHowever, if a wool item with a metadata value of \u00b116, \u00b132, \u00b148, \u00b164,...\n\nis obtained as an item, which cannot be done in normal Survival gameplay or in Creative without commands, the game does not special-case these values due to them not being intentionally obtainable, resulting in this sixteenth texture in the rectangle being selected as the item's texture.\n\nIn Beta 1.9's development, the then-new nether wart required a texture to be used in-game.\n\nWhere exactly a texture is in terrain.png is ultimately arbitrary, as the game's code can be made to point at any desired region.\n\nUltimately, the textures used by nether wart were placed at a position in terrain.png which resulted in the first stage's texture being within the 2\u00d78 rectangle used by most wool items, resulting in the invalid cases using the newly-planted nether wart texture as if it were any other texture.\n\nWhen placed, invalid data value wool will place normal white wool blocks.\n\nAs these placed blocks are proper white wool, they will drop white wool when broken, rather than invalid data values of wool.\n\nInvalid data value wool items are an issue, and due to their removal, can be considered already fixed.\n\nThe first known mention of invalid data value wool is from January 23, 2011, ten days after it properly came into existence in Beta 1.2.\n\n[2] Invalid data value wool in Java Edition Beta 1.3 Invalid data value wool in TU1 \u2191 MC-11894 \u2191 Wool on January 23, 2011 Invalid data value items View at: Template:IDV items/content [edit ]",

of JSON code, as long as the resulting syntax is valid.\n\nFor example: A pair of Curlies that enclose a named \"Name\" item and some value, e.g.\n\na Byte, create a \"Compound Tag\" with the content {Example:0b}.\n\nBecause of the limited size of the crafting table only 3 name-value pairs can be put between Curlies at a time.\n\nCompound Tags of any length can be created by concatenating two or more Compound Tags.\n\nAn empty pair of Curlies produces an empty Compound Tag with the content {}.\n\nA pair of Square brackets that enclose any number of values, e.g.\n\n7 Bytes, create a \"List Tag\" with the content [0b,0b,0b,0b,0b,0b,0b].\n\nBecause of the limited size of the crafting table only 7 values can be put between Square brackets at a time.\n\nList Tags of any length can be created by concatenating two or more List Tags.\n\nAn empty pair of Square brackets produces an empty List with the content.\n\n\"Name\" items cannot be used in a List.\n\nThe resulting Compound and List Tags can be used as values in other Compound and List Tags, as deeply nested as you want.\n\nTags appear to have no further functionality.\n\nThey cannot be eaten or placed in the world, except in an item frame, as each other item can.\n\nHowever, Compound Tags with values like {Enchantments:[{id:\"minecraft:sharpness\",lvl:127b}]} will show the enchantment glint and actually act accordingly when used.\n\n[1] This appears to work with many weapon and tool enchantments.\n\nIn theory, an extremely lucky replace_recipe_output vote can change the crafting recipe for compound tags to output something else.\n\nWhen cheats are enabled you can test this with a command like /vote rule minecraft:replace_recipe_output approve {key:\"minecraft:compound_tag\",value:\"minecraft:netherite_sword\"}.\n\nHowever, as long as this vote is approved no other compound tag can be crafted.\n\nUse /vote rule minecraft:replace_recipe_output repeal * to undo all recipe replacements.\n\nIn combination with the midas_touch vote tag items can be converted into gold ingots.\n\nThese retain their NBT data.\n\nWhen the world is loaded in another version of the game tag items disappear, but gold ingots persist.\n\nThis implies that a name tag is 128 bit.\n\nCompound and list tags are special in so far that the value they show in their tooltip is not merely a property of the item, but their actual NBT data.\n\nThis is also the reason why naming them is disabled as that would mess up the NBT data.\n\nThe snapshot also contains an unused texture for an End Tag.\n\nTag Bit Byte Tag Double Tag End Tag Float Tag Int Tag Left Curly Left Sqaure List Tag Long Tag Name Right Curly Right Square Short Tag Sssyntax Error String Tag \u2191 https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/129xdyl/i_figure_out_how_the_nbtcrafting_in_the_vote/ Items View at: Template:Items/content [edit ]",

burped, and I was told a tale that the Baby Ghast claimed had been passed down for generations.\n\nIs there a nugget of truth in it?\n\nWho\u2019s to say, that Baby Ghast has a stoic poker face.\n\nI hope you enjoy it as much as I did, my apologies for not being able to punctuate with a baby fireball.\n\n\u201e \u2014 Sofia Dankis, author of Baby Ghast Presents: The Illager\u2019s New Robes Baby Ghast Presents: The Illager\u2019s New Robes is a short story set within Minecraft Dungeons.\n\nIt is authored by Sofia Dankis and was published on Minecraft.net on September 27, 2021.\n\n[1] Around a campfire, the baby ghast tells a tale that it claims had been passed down for generations.\n\nThe baby ghast begins the story by introducing a group of powerful illagers who lived deep within the Pumpkin Pastures, terrorizing villages and defeating heroes.\n\nOne night, an unnamed evoker stumbles upon an unnamed hero wandering the land with a baby ghast.\n\nThe evoker prepares to attack the hero, only for the hero to surprise attack the evoker first before making their escape.\n\nUpon returning to the lair, the evoker argues with the other illagers about the incident before retreating to ponder in peace upon what makes this specific hero different from other heroes.\n\nThey quickly come to the realization that the baby ghast must be the answer due to never seeing one before.\n\nThe evoker leaves their lair for a few days, in search of the baby ghast to study it.\n\nUpon finding both the hero and the baby ghast, the evoker comes to the conclusion that the red core must be the cause of the baby ghast\u2019s terrifying appearance.\n\nThey then begin to imagine the possible advantage of combining that terrifying appearance with their own large size.\n\nThe evoker immediately set to work in the lair, comparing the various stitching in the battle robe to their evocation robe and using the patterns in the splendid robe.\n\nSo as to not disturb the evoker, the other illagers busied themselves with spreading terror and capturing villagers.\n\nWhen the evoker finished creating their new robes, they showed off their see-through creation through spectacle.\n\nIt is at this point when the baby ghast telling the tale provides a description of the robes themselves, describing them as being \u201ca bright white with a red square pattern stitched into the midsection,\u201d and that they \u201cwere opulent, but opaque.\u201d Fearing the evoker\u2019s large size, the other illagers refrained from giving feedback and instead voiced admiration of the robes, convinced that they could now capture more villagers than ever before.\n\nEncouraged by the other illager\u2019s admiration, the evoker sets out to terrify villagers and their pets with their new see-through appearance.\n\nThe evoker is so engrossed with capturing villagers that they are ambushed by the very same hero and baby ghast from before.\n\nDespite quickly recovering from the shock, the evoker lets their ego get the better of them, feeling as though their new robes would terrify the hero, but instead it provides the hero with the advantage.\n\nWhen the evoker\u2019s intended effect fails and the hero frees all of the villagers, the evoker ponders whether they did something wrong during the creation of the robes as they were admired by the other illagers.\n\nThe evoker\u2019s pondering is rewarded with an answer when the baby ghast reveals to them it\u2019s ability to fade in and out of invisibility.\n\nThe evoker realizes then that without the baby ghast\u2019s translucent elusiveness, the \u201cred square pattern stitched into the midsection,\u201d made them an obvious target rather than a invisible opponent.\n\nUpon returning to the lair, the evoker changes back into their own robes and discards the new robes.\n\nWhile the evoker and the other illagers never mentioned the incident with the new robes in stories, it was told and re-told across many generations, with many changes being made and details being lost.\n\nDespite this, the moral of the story survived in that \u201cno matter what you\u2019re wearing, your true colors will always shine through.\u201d In the game files, the baby ghast is referred to internally by the name BabyGhast.\n\nThe baby ghast is seen within a Twitter video shooting one small fireball at the village merchant, despite not being able to shoot fireballs in-game.\n\n[3] Ghast Baby ghast UI.\n\nBaby ghast idle.\n\nBaby ghast walk.\n\nBaby ghast novelty.\n\nTexture of the baby ghast.\n\nConcept art of the baby ghast.\n\nTwo baby

in the Adventure Pass thumbnail, excluding the helmet.\n\nIvor kept eight sets of armor in his laboratory in the far lands which he had enchanted for the order.\n\nThey each had special

blue and gold armor.\n\nLukas wears orange, gray, and black armor with goggles.\n\nAxel wears a glass helmet, similar to Magnus, along with gloves, a chestplate, and boots.\n\nOlivia wears red and gold armor with goggles, similar to the goggles worn by Ellegaard.\n\nThe Old Builders kept a set of armor in the Hadrian's palace, claiming that it once belonged to the famous competitor called Tim.\n\nIt was a strong set of armor.\n\nIn \"Below the Bedrock\", Binta provides a set of sleeping garments to the winner of the trivia contest.\n\nThe garments resemble Fred's outfit.\n\nIf Jesse wins the contest and chooses to wear the garments, they will wear the garments until changing armor before entering the challenge room in Romeoburg.\n\nBefore Jesse, Petra, and Radar are permitted into the Challenge room, Soup and Val offer them some armor to wear.\n\nJesse has up to nine options: The Tooth Chipper Goofball Glory Llama Brown-ish Please Don't Hit Me Dented Danger Feelin' Cute Armor Number 7 Straps n' Straps The Golden Apple, a special golden armor which Lluna finds buried under the ground.\n\n(determinant) The champion armor is the armor that either Jack or Petra wears after they were controlled by the admin to be his champion.\n\nThe champion armor has its very own gauntlet to go with the outfit.\n\nAccording to Eric Stirpe, it was inspired by Angel's \"Archangel\".\n\n[1] Jesse has the choice of choosing new armor or keeping Magnus's or Ellegaard's armor in Ivor's far lands house.\n\nThe names and descriptions of Ivor's enchanted armors are mentioned by Ivor when looking at them.\n\nThey are as follows: \"The Adamantine Impervium!\n\nEven harder to damage than it is to pronounce!\" \"I call this the Star Shield!\n\nNo object in the Universe can penetrate it!\" \"Ah, Dragonsbane.\n\nEven the Ender Dragon would've fled from this in terror!\" \"I call this one the Shield of Infinity!\n\nIn no small part because it's infinitely

Redstone Riot!\n\nEngineered to be virtually indestructible!\" \"This one is named Golden Goliath!\n\nAs bright and powerful as the Sun itself!\" In \" Hero in Residence \", Jesse can give comments on his/her armor.\n\n\"The Redstone Riot.\n\nBeautiful engineering on this one.\" \" Golden Goliath.\n\nAlways loved how shiny this one is.\" \"The Ender Defender.\n\nVery fresh armor.\" \"The Star Shield.\n\nGreat set of armor.\" \"The Shield of Infinity.\n\nI love how regal this one looks.\" \" Dragonsbane.\n\nSo cool.\" \" Swordbreaker.\n\nNice classic name, awesome modern look.\" \"Glimmering diamonds and shiny gold.\n\nTim would've looked great in it, if he was real.\" (Tim's armor) \"How cool is Redstone-infused armor?\" (Ellegaard's armor) \"Griefer armor if I've ever seen it.\n\nMagnus was a crazy guy.\" (Magnus's armor) \"Ah, Adamantine Impervium.\n\nI always suspected this one was Ivor's favorite.\" In the episode \"Below the Bedrock\", Soup may give her own personal comments on the challenge room armors.\n\n\" Don't try to eat armor.\n\nBest advice I ever heard.\n\n\" (The Tooth Chipper) \" Poor goofballs.\n\nCut down in their prime.\n\n\" (Goofball Glory) \" Don't ask me how I come up with the names.\n\nSometimes inspiration just comes to ya, y' know?\n\n\" (Llama Brown-ish) \" Armor of such fine quality you just wanna crouch and yell, 'Please don't hit me!' \" (Please Don't Hit Me) \" Dangerous, but also damaged so it's more relatable.\n\n\" (Dented Danger) \" You know, like...\n\none...\n\ntrillion outta ten!\n\nYeah!\n\n\" (Feelin' Cute) \"'

armor?'.\n\nTurns out a lot, is the answer.\n\n\" (Straps n' Straps) \" Um.\n\nHow 'bout I call this one...\n\nthe uh...\n\nthe uh...\n\nGolden Apple!\n\nYeah...\n\nI might just be hungry.\n\n\" (determinant) In Episode 5 of the first season, several sets of Ivor's enchanted armor can be seen on display inside the treasure room.\n\nSometimes, the armor Jesse picks may also appear on display in the treasure room.\n\nIn the first season, skipping Episode 4 will cause the dragonsbane armor to be automatically chosen, while in Season Two, if Episode 1 is skipped and the player starts Episode 2, then the shield of infinity armor will be automatically chosen.\n\nThe eight sets of armor for Jesse don't have helmets.\n\nWhilst the sets of armor are all uniquely colored, they are actually palette swaps of each other: Dragonsbane is a purple variant of Ender Defender.\n\nThe Redstone Riot is a red variant of the Shield of Infinity.\n\nThe Adamantium Impervium is a darker variant of Swordbreaker.\n\nGolden Goliath is an orange variant of the Star Shield.\n\nTim's armor has a helmet but Jesse doesn't use it after episode 8.\n\nA glitch can occur with Jesse's iron armor that causes it to appear on Jesse again, despite being destroyed by Lluna.\n\n[verify ] Unlike other members of the Jesse's team, Jesse's armor does not drop from their inventory after being eliminated in \"A Journey's End\".\n\n\u2191 \"It was inspired by Angel\u2019s \u201cArchangel\u201d look after he was kidnapped and modified by Apocalypse - Even after he was freed, he still had that look for years

Renewable Yes Stackable Yes (64) Tools Blast resistance 1 Hardness 1 Luminous No Transparent Yes Flammable Bamboo: Yes (60) Shoot: No Catches fire from lava Yes Bamboo is a versatile, fast-growing, bonemealable plant found primarily in jungles, which is used for crafting (particularly scaffolding and bamboo wood), smelting and breeding pandas.\n\nA bamboo shoot is the initial non-solid sapling form of planted bamboo.\n\nBamboo shoots cannot be obtained through vanilla means.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, they can be obtained through add-ons or inventory editing.\n\nIn Java Edition, they are completely unobtainable.\n\nBamboo can be mined with any tool, but a sword breaks the block instantly, even with Mining Fatigue.\n\nFlowing water also breaks bamboo shoots, but not mature bamboo stalks.\n\n\u2191 Times are for unenchanted tools as wielded by players with no status effects, measured in seconds.\n\nFor more information, see Breaking \u00a7 Speed.\n\nBamboo generates in widely scattered single shoots within jungle biomes.\n\nBamboo generates much more densely in the bamboo variants of jungles, covering large areas of the landscape.\n\nBamboo does not generate in sparse jungles.\n\n[1] In Java Edition, a panda drops 1 bamboo when killed.\n\nLooting does not affect the drop rate.\n\n[2] In Bedrock Edition, a panda drops 0-2 bamboo when killed.\n\nLooting increases the drop by 1 per level.\n\nBamboo can be found while fishing in jungle biomes as a junk item.\n\nWhen broken, any bamboo block placed or grown above it is also broken.\n\nA bamboo block drops itself as an item if a piston pushes it or moves a block into its space.\n\nWhen bamboo is first placed as a shoot it's not solid and can be destroyed by water flowing into it.\n\nAfter growing at least one block taller it becomes solid and can't be destroyed by water.\n\nTo transform a bamboo shoot into a solid bamboo block place another bamboo on top of it.\n\nUnlike most plants, bamboo cannot be composted.\n\n[3] Bamboo can be planted on moss blocks  [JE only ], grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, gravel, mycelium, podzol, sand, red sand, suspicious sand, suspicious gravel, mud, bamboo shoot, or on itself.\n\nAt default random tick speed (3), each plant grows on average every 4096 game ticks (204.8 seconds).\n\nWhen bone meal is used on it, it grows by 1\u20132 blocks.\n\nBamboo can grow up to 12\u201316 blocks tall.\n\nThe top of a bamboo plant requires a light level of 9 or above to grow.\n\nBecause bamboo breaks in almost the same way as sugar canes, a sugar cane farm can be easily adapted to this use.\n\nWhile water is not needed with such a farm, some spacing is recommended if the harvest is done manually as mature stalks are solid.\n\nBamboo items are eaten by pandas and can be used to speed up the growth of baby pandas.\n\nBamboo can also be used to breed pandas when at least 8 blocks of bamboo are within 5 blocks of the pandas, making the panda the only animal in the game to have extra breeding requirements.\n\nAt this point, the player can feed them bamboo and they mate to have a baby.\n\nBamboo can be used as fuel for smelting.\n\nEach bamboo item smelts 0.25 items.\n\nCrafting two bamboo into a stick and using that as fuel is equivalent, smelting 0.5 items.\n\nBamboo can be crafted into other items to increase its fuel efficiency.\n\nBy crafting 9 bamboo into 2 bamboo planks, 3 items can be smelted instead of 2.25, a 33.3% increase in efficiency.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the fuel efficiency can be further doubled by crafting the bamboo planks into twice the amount of slabs.\n\n[4] In Java Edition, by crafting 14 bamboo into 3 ladders, 4.5 items can be smelted instead of 3.5, a 28.6% increase in efficiency.\n\nBamboo can be placed in a flower pot, where it retains the design it has in its item form.\n\nThe different stages of bamboo growth.\n\nThe appearance of bamboo changes as it grows.\n\nWhen first placed, it takes the form of a small shoot, which has no hitbox.\n\nWhen it grows one block taller it grows to 2 pixels in length and width and the top block has leaves coming off it.\n\nAt 3 blocks, the top 2 blocks have leaves and at 4 blocks the bamboo expands to 3\u00d73 pixels.\n\nAt 5 blocks tall, the top 3 blocks have leaves on them.\n\nAs the bamboo grows, the leaves move up and stay at the top 3 blocks.\n\nDestroying a block of bamboo does not change the appearance of the blocks below it.\n\nBamboo is oriented at a random position in the block that it is in.\n\nJava Edition: \u2191 a b MC-177082 \u2191 1.0 for all except step2 and step4, which are 0.7 Bedrock Edition: \u2191 1.0 for all except step2 and step4, which are 0.7 Java Edition: \u2191 a b

attempts to grow if the block above is air.\n\nThe flower does not age if growth is not attempted due to lack of an air block above.\n\nBone meal has no effect on growth.\n\n[1] The flower may attempt to grow upward depending on the structure of chorus plant blocks directly beneath: 100% chance if zero or one plant block is directly beneath 60% if the flower is above a two-block unbranched plant

20% if above a four-block unbranched plant The growth attempt succeeds if the blocks horizontally adjacent to and above the target block above are all air, and results in the target block becoming a flower block with the same age while the existing flower block turns to chorus plant.\n\nIf upward growth does not occur and the flower's age is less than 4, the flower may attempt to branch horizontally.\n\n1\u20134 branches are attempted on an unbranched plant or 0\u20133 on a branched plant.\n\nFor each branch a horizontal direction is chosen at random, and if the block in that direction is an air block with more air blocks on all other horizontal sides and an air block below, it is replaced with a flower with age incremented by 1.\n\nIf at least one branch succeeds, the original flower block is turned to chorus plant.\n\nUpon a successful growth attempt, the chorus flower emits a low-pitched sound, similar to the sound endermen emit when teleporting.\n\nIf no growth occurs on a growth attempt, the flower's age is set to 5.\n\nFlowers and plant height The amount of chorus flowers a player gets from a fully and unrestricted grown chorus plant ranges from 1 to 8,

[Java Edition only ] For a dirt block to accept grass from a nearby grass block, the following requirements must be met: The dirt block receiving grass must be within a 3\u00d75\u00d73 range of the source grass block where the source block is in the center of the second topmost layer of that range.\n\nThe source grass block must have a light level of 9 or brighter directly above it. [Java Edition only ] The block directly above the dirt block must allow light to pass through it and hit the dirt block, even though the actual light level does not matter.\n\nThat means blocks that partially let light through such as stairs and slabs must not have their light-blocking side(s) [Java Edition only ] facing the dirt block.\n\nThe block directly above the dirt block must not be lava, water, or a waterlogged variant of a block.\n\nWhen grass is random ticked, it spreads by checking 4 blocks within range and converts any dirt blocks selected into grass.\n\nThough water and lava are both light-filtering blocks (meaning they decrease skylight by 1 level but do not affect block light), other light-filtering blocks such as ice and slime blocks do not block grass from spreading to the dirt block.\n\nGrass blocks can grow under all other transparent blocks like glass, fences, or torches.\n\nGrass jumps directly from one block to a neighbor and is not affected by gaps or other blocks being \"in the way.\" Grass blocks spread at random intervals and have an equal chance of spreading to any suitable dirt blocks that are in range.\n\nBecause grass can spread as much as 3 levels downward, it tends to spread down slopes much faster than it spreads up them.\n\nEndermen can pick up grass blocks, and drop the blocks they are holding if killed, making it the only way to obtain grass blocks without the use of Silk Touch.\n\nMain article: Color \u00a7 Biome colors Plains (left) and forest (right) grass colors.\n\nThe coloration of grass blocks is dependent on the biome they are in.\n\nA grass block always uses the color set to its location, regardless of how it was placed or of its source.\n\nThis affects the side and top of the block.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, biome colors also appear on maps.\n\n[1] in Java Edition, item of grass block uses biome color with temperature 0.5, downfall 1.0, and as result is colored #7cbd6b.\n\nThese values are generated by the biome dyeing algorithm.\n\nSee Biome colors for more information.\n\nUnused biomes in Bedrock Edition.\n\n\u2191 a b c d Color is preset \u2191 a b Above -0.1 temperature.\n\n\u2191 a b Below -0.1 temperature.\n\nUsing bone meal on grass blocks causes grass, tall grass, ferns, [Bedrock Edition only ] large ferns, [Bedrock Edition only ] and flowers to grow.\n\nPassive mobs tend to wander toward grass blocks.\n\nThey also wander toward light.\n\nWhen a sheep eats a grass block, the block becomes dirt, and a sheared sheep regrows its wool.\n\nTilling a grass block with a hoe converts it to a farmland block.\n\nDirt paths can be created by using any type of shovel on the side or top of a grass block with air above it.\n\nThe shovel loses 1 durability for each dirt path block created.\n\nGrass dies and changes to dirt a random time (when a random tick lands on the block) after it has been covered by any opaque blocks.\n\nTransparent blocks can kill grass in a similar manner if they cause the light level above the grass block to be four or below (like water does), and the surrounding area is not otherwise sufficiently illuminated.\n\nIn Java Edition, animals occasionally spawn on grass blocks that have light level 9 or brighter in the space directly above.\n\nThis is quite rare and requires that there be few other animals nearby or in the spawn chunks.\n\nMost animals are instead created along with the terrain.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, most animals require surface grass blocks (grass blocks with no solid block anywhere above them at the same x, z coordinate) to spawn.\n\nAnimals regularly spawn in most Overworld biomes on surface grass blocks that have light level 7 or brighter in the space directly above.\n\nA snowy grass block with a snow on top of it.\n\nGrass blocks turn into a snowy grass block if a snow or a snow block is placed on top of the block.\n\nRemoving the snow layer will turn the block into a normal grass block.\n\nPlacing grass blocks into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

biome.\n\nJungle trees range from short bushes to tall trees that reach up to 31 blocks in height.\n\nTheir wood is of a pale brownish color.\n\nRegular jungle trees lack branches, and the trunk covers a 1\u00d71 space on the ground.\n\nThe leaves of these 1\u00d71 trees are arranged the same way as the birch tree leaf arrangement.\n\nGiant jungle trees grow branches (logs connected horizontally, vertically or diagonally to the trunk or other branches).\n\nMost of the time, a single tree has between one and six branches, and each branch has between one and six logs.\n\nThe trunk typically covers a 2\u00d72 space on the ground.\n\nThere are also much smaller, bush-type variants, which have only 1\u20132 logs and a few leaves.\n\nThey are typically 1\u20133 layers tall and cover the floor of jungle biomes.\n\nIn Java Edition, they consist of oak leaves and a jungle log, while in Bedrock Edition, they consist of jungle leaves and a jungle log.\n\nThe jungle tree variants generate naturally in the indicated biomes: A large jungle tree always generates with dirt under its trunk, even if it spawns partly or wholly over air or water blocks.\n\nThese items can be obtained from all variants of jungle tree, except that saplings cannot be obtained from a bush: Cocoa Beans (obtained by harvesting cocoa pods attached to tree) Oak Leaves  [Java Edition only ] (harvested with shears) Jungle Leaves (harvested with shears, or a silk touch axe) Jungle Log (harvested with any tool including hands) Jungle Planks (created from a log in the inventory crafting grid) Jungle Sapling

tree saplings can be planted on: Dirt Grass Block Coarse Dirt Podzol Mycelium Rooted Dirt Moss Block Farmland Mud Muddy Mangrove Roots This jungle tree cannot grow because of the red wool block (looking from the northwestern corner) When planted in grass or dirt, a jungle sapling grows into a jungle tree with a 1\u00d71 trunk, but the player can place saplings in a 2\u00d72 formation and they grow into a jungle tree with the 2\u00d72 trunk found naturally in the jungle biome.\n\n1\u00d71 jungle trees require a 3\u00d73 column of unobstructed space at least 5 blocks above the sapling to grow (6 blocks including the sapling itself).\n\nAdditionally, 1\u00d71 jungle trees require 5\u00d75 layers without obstruction for the top 3 layers of its final height.\n\nNo horizontal clearance is needed at the base of the tree (a sapling planted in a hole 1 block deep still grows).\n\nIn order to grow a 2\u00d72 jungle tree, four saplings must be placed adjacent to each other in a square.\n\nFor growth to succeed, there must be no blocks adjacent (even diagonally) to the north-western side up to the final height of the tree.\n\nBone meal can be used on any of the saplings to accelerate growth.\n\n2\u00d72 jungle trees require a 5\u00d75 column of unobstructed space at least 11 blocks above the saplings to grow (12 blocks including the saplings themselves).\n\nThis column is centered on the northwestern sapling.\n\nA 3\u00d73 area is required at the base of the tree (the level of the saplings).\n\nThey can grow up to 32 blocks high.\n\nIf planted by the player, 1\u00d71 jungle trees do not generate with vines, while 2\u00d72 jungle trees do.\n\n2x2 jungle trees cannot grow side by side because the vines break the space clearance requirement.\n\nLarge and

log.\n\nA dying jungle tree has the standard growth pattern of any other tree, although all exposed logs in the main trunk are covered with vines.\n\nA fallen jungle tree may consist of a single upright log, or a stump.\n\nLogs lying on their side are often found 1\u20132 blocks from the stump.\n\nThey occasionally have mushrooms on top.\n\nA fallen jungle tree has a log length of 4\u201311

fallen trees) Mushrooms (some fallen trees) [BE only ] Bee Nest An oak is the most common tree in the game, found in a variety of biomes, available in several variants.\n\nIt has the smallest initial space requirement for growth, and along with dark oak trees, it has a chance to drop an apple when a leaf block is destroyed.\n\nAs with birches, an oak tree grown near flowers can generate with a bee nest attached.\n\nOaks come in several variants with different properties: Small regular oaks are the most common.\n\nThe leaves are arranged the same as the birch leaf arrangement.\n\nFancy oaks are less common and have a distinct look and different growth requirements.\n\nThey often have branches, outgrowths of logs on the sides of the trunk, or even freestanding and surrounded by leaves.\n\nThe sapling requires 4\u201314 blocks of open space directly above to grow (air or leaves only) but can otherwise be completely enclosed on all sides.\n\nA fancy oak form exists with a single leaf block layer above the minimal 4-block trunk, rarely allowing a tree to grow in a vertical space with a height of only 5, but otherwise, the maximum trunk height is 2 less than the vertical space, making the practical minimum height 6.\n\nAn oak can be forced into a fancy configuration if a \"brace\" of non-solid blocks (e.g.\n\nglass or slabs) is placed around where the trunk would be, one block off the ground.\n\nA rare variant is colloquially known as a \"balloon\" oak.\n\nThis is a fancy oak generated with the smallest size possible.\n\nIt consists of a tall trunk and leaves that form a spherical shape, similar to a balloon.\n\nThese oaks can grow around an obstructing block.\n\nThey usually contain 4 blocks of logs, but some may contain more.\n\nIn swamp biomes, naturally occurring swamp oaks tend to grow in the water.\n\nUnlike trees in other biomes, which typically have a slightly conical or pointed canopy, all swamp oaks have round, flat-topped canopies.\n\nAlso unlike oaks, these have a broad range of foliage.\n\nThey tend to be covered in vines that trail down to the ground.\n\nMeeting point 3 in plains village.\n\nAn oak tree with a unique arrangement of leaves is generated at meeting point 3, in plains villages.\n\nThis leaf arrangement is not found elsewhere naturally, and it cannot be grown from a sapling.\n\nThe oak tree variants spawn naturally in the indicated biomes: These items can be obtained from all variants of oak: Apple (chance of dropping when breaking leaves) Bee Nest (if spawned on an oak near flowers) Mushrooms  [Bedrock Edition only ] (if present on a fallen oak log) Oak Leaves (harvested with shears) Oak Log (harvested with any tool including hands) Oak Planks (created from a log in the inventory crafting grid) Oak Sapling (chance of dropping when breaking leaves) Stripped Oak Log (created by using an axe on a log) Vines (harvested with shears from a swamp oak, or from a dying tree [Bedrock Edition only ]) Stick (chance of dropping when breaking leaves) Oak saplings can be planted and grown on all of these blocks: Dirt Grass Block Coarse Dirt Podzol Mycelium Rooted Dirt Moss Block Farmland Mud Muddy Mangrove Roots An oak tree requires a 1\u00d71 column of unobstructed space at least 4 blocks above its sapling to grow (5 blocks including the sapling itself).\n\nOak trees can still grow when the base and trunk are enclosed on all sides.\n\nTheir growth is not hindered by logs, leaves, dirt, or saplings.\n\nAn oak tree grown from a sapling within 2 blocks of a flower has a 5% chance of having a bee nest containing 2 bees.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, trees can generate as one of the two following variants of the normal tree.\n\nBoth of these generate naturally, and can be grown out of normal saplings.\n\n[1] [2] The different dying tree types.\n\nA fallen oak log.\n\nA dying oak has the standard growth pattern of any other tree, however, all exposed logs in the main trunk are covered with vines.\n\nThey can generate as regular or small oak trees.\n\nThese trees consist of a single upright log or stump.\n\nLogs lying on their side are often found 1\u20132 blocks from the stump.\n\nThey occasionally have mushrooms on top.\n\nA fallen oak has a log length of 4\u20137 blocks and the stump is 75% covered with vines.\n\nIssues relating to \"Oak\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nIn real life, oak is a genus of trees known as Quercus.\n\nOak with Bee Nest Small Fancy Oak Fancy

Mushrooms (some fallen trees) [BE only ] All existing spruce and pine variants A spruce and pine, grows from a spruce sapling and has growth patterns and requirements similar to birch trees, although they appear different.\n\nThey are mainly found in the taiga biome, but they may also generate in windswept forest, snowy plains, snowy taiga, and old growth taiga biomes.\n\nThere are several different forms of these trees that may grow from any spruce saplings: A spruce - common variant with a height between 5-12.\n\nThe leaves tend to grow in discrete rows rather than the more spherical arrangement of oaks and birch trees.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, only this variant can be grown using saplings.\n\nA pine - fairly tall variant of spruce trees that generate in a matchstick style, with only a few leaves at the top.\n\nA mega spruce - larger variant of spruce that generates in the old growth spruce taiga which has a lot more leaves than the mega pine.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, only this variant can be grown using saplings.\n\nA mega pine - larger variant of pine that generates in the old growth pine taiga These spruce trees have few leaves, concentrated at the top, and can be grown from spruce saplings arranged in a 2\u00d72 square, with or without bone meal.\n\nComparison of mega spruce and mega pine sizes from different biomes, left to right: old growth pine taiga, old growth spruce taiga, and a regular spruce tree.\n\nMega spruce with canopies in different shapes.\n\nThe spruce tree variants spawn naturally in the indicated biomes: The maximum reach of podzol from a single mega spruce.\n\nUp is north.\n\nIn an amplified taiga or old growth taiga, some of the spruces generate with snow on them, just like in the other cold biomes.\n\nWhen mega spruces grow, they convert any grass blocks, dirt, mycelium, coarse dirt, rooted dirt and moss blocks  [Java Edition only ] [1] up to a radius of 6 blocks to podzol, centered on the south-eastern sapling.\n\nLike birches, they do not grow branches.\n\nWhen height-constrained, the trunk height maximum is two less than the roof.\n\nThe headroom of 9 blocks limits the tree to a trunk height of 7, which enables harvesting from ground level.\n\nThese items can be obtained from all variants of spruce.\n\nMushrooms  [Bedrock Edition only ] (if present on a fallen log) Spruce Leaves (harvested with shears)

saplings must be placed adjacent to each other in a square.\n\nFor growth to succeed, there must be no blocks adjacent (even diagonally) to the north-western side up to the final height of the tree.\n\nBone meal can be used on any of the saplings.\n\nThe largest mega spruces and mega pines reach 30 blocks tall.\n\n1\u00d71 spruces require a 5\u00d75 column of unobstructed space at least 7

still grow).\n\n2\u00d72 mega spruces require a 5\u00d75 column of unobstructed space at least 14 blocks above the saplings to grow (15 blocks including the saplings themselves).\n\nThis column is centered on the northwestern sapling.\n\nA 3\u00d73 area is required at the base of the tree (the level of the saplings).\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, trees can generate as one of the two following variants of the normal tree.\n\nBoth of these generate naturally, and can be grown out of normal saplings.\n\n[2] [3] The different dying tree types.\n\nFallen spruce log.\n\nA dying spruce and dying pine has the standard growth pattern of any other tree, however, all exposed logs in the main trunk are covered with vines.\n\nA fallen spruce may consist of a single upright log, or a stump.\n\nLogs lying on their side are often found 1\u20132 blocks from the stump.\n\nThey occasionally have mushrooms on top.\n\nA fallen spruce log has a length of 6\u201310 blocks, and the stump is never covered with vines.\n\nMain article: Tint Spruce leaves do not follow the foliage color rules that

otherwise, they disappear.\n\nFancy oak, dark oak, and mega jungle trees grow branches (logs connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to the trunk or other branches).\n\nMost of the time, a single tree has between one and six branches, and each branch has between one and six logs.\n\nAcacia tree branches do not cover their branches in this way.\n\n[more information needed ] Regular oak, jungle, birch, spruce, pine, mega spruce, and mega pine lack branches.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Tree farming This jungle tree cannot grow because of the red wool block (looking from the northwestern corner) Trees are created when chunks are generated, and can also be grown from saplings.\n\nTree saplings have a 1 \u2044 20 chance (1 \u2044 40 if they are jungle saplings) of dropping from leaf blocks when they decay or are destroyed.\n\nThere are seven species of saplings, corresponding to seven of the eight main trees: oak, birch, spruce, jungle, acacia, dark oak, and cherry.\n\nA tree that was grown in a cave, with the necessary light provided by torches.\n\nThe sapling can be planted on any variant of dirt (except dirt path) a moss block or a mud, and must have a light level of at least 8 in the sapling block.\n\nA sapling uproots with light level 7 or less in the sapling block itself unless it has a view of the sky that is unobstructed (except by glass or other transparent materials).\n\nThe sapling must have at least 6 blocks of space above it to grow; the amount of required space varies between the different species of trees.\n\nA ceiling above sapling limits the maximum height of the tree that can grow from that sapling.\n\nHowever, dirt blocks and logs may not prohibit tree growth, and in some cases may be replaced as a sapling attempt to grow through them.\n\nHowever in Bedrock edition, logs prohibit tree growth.\n\nIf multiple saplings are planted next to each other, each one grows as long as the leaves from the other grown saplings do not block too much of the sunlight.\n\nArtificial light (torches, etc.) can still be used to grow them if this happens.\n\nTrees can be generated anywhere where there is light and dirt.\n\nAll trees in the active chunk radius around the player make attempts to grow at random intervals.\n\nFor any given tree this can work out to about one growth attempt per minute.\n\nWhen a tree attempts to grow, it first checks that it has enough light, then randomly chooses which variant of that species of tree to become; for example, an oak sapling chooses to grow as either a normal or fancy oak tree.\n\nOnce a tree has passed a light check and chosen size to attempt, it checks if there is enough space for its chosen size.\n\nIf it encounters an obstruction during this check, it fails to grow and must wait for the next pass before it can attempt to grow again.\n\nThis means that a tree in an open field with enough light grows relatively quickly, but a tree in a cramped tree farm that stunts its size may make several attempts before finally growing.\n\nBone meal, when used on a sapling, has a chance of forcing it to grow, so long as all of the normal checks (light, space, dirt, etc.) have passed.\n\nIt does not guarantee growth, but forces an attempt to grow.\n\nPlanting trees in the Nether All saplings grow normally in the Nether and in the End, although they must be planted in dirt transported from the Overworld and provided with sufficient light and space.\n\nLeaf blocks in the Nether have the same color as if they were placed in a desert biome.\n\nIn the End, they are a dull bluish-green, as in the windswept hills biome.\n\nIn order to grow a 2\u00d72 tree (be it spruce, jungle or dark oak), four saplings must be placed adjacent to each other in a square.\n\nFor growth to succeed, there must be no blocks adjacent (even diagonally) to the north-western side up to the final height of the tree.\n\nThe bone meal can be used on any of the saplings.\n\nThe largest mega jungle trees, mega spruces, and mega pines reach 31 blocks tall.\n\nDark oaks are typically 6\u20138 blocks tall.\n\nLeaves and logs removed from a tree do not grow back over time.\n\nWhen a sapling on a grass block or mycelium grows into a tree, the grass block or mycelium is instantly converted to dirt.\n\nSee also: Tree/Structure There are nine types of trees \u2013 oak, spruce, birch, jungle tree, acacia, dark oak, azalea tree, mangrove, and cherry.\n\nOther structures are loosely defined as trees: the huge fungus, huge mushroom, and chorus plant.\n\nMain article: Oak Oaks are among the most common trees in the game.\n\nThey have the smallest space requirements, and along with dark oak trees, they can drop an apple when a leaf block is destroyed.\n\nIn swamp biomes, a slightly larger variant of the regular oak tree with vines is generated, which can naturally generate in shallow water.\n\nFancy oaks may also grow or generate in place of regular oaks; these are taller and may feature branches.\n\nA rare variant is its smallest configuration, colloquially known as a \"balloon\" oak.\n\nAn oak.\n\nA fancy oak.\n\nA \"balloon\" oak.\n\nA swamp oak.\n\nMain article: Spruce Spruce trees grow from spruce saplings and have growth patterns and requirements similar to birch trees, although they appear different.\n\nThey are mainly found in the taiga biome, but they may also generate in windswept forest, snowy plains, snowy taiga, and old growth taiga biomes.\n\nSpruce logs have the same texture as oak logs, but it is a darker shade of brown; its leaves are denser, with a darker and more bluish tone.\n\nA spruce.\n\nA thin pine.\n\nA \"lollipop\" pine.\n\nA mega spruce.\n\nA mega pine.\n\nMain article: Birch Birch trees look fairly similar to small oaks in terms of height and are most commonly found in birch forest biomes.\n\nThere are two types of birch: a shorter tree that can be grown by the player with birch saplings; and a taller, rarer variety that generates only naturally in tall birch forest biomes.\n\nA birch tree.\n\nA tall birch tree.\n\nMain articles: Jungle Tree and Jungle Bush Jungle trees are one of the rarest naturally generated trees in Minecraft because they are native to the jungle biomes, which are themselves rare.\n\nJungle tree leaves drop jungle tree saplings.\n\nWhen planted in grass or dirt they grow into a jungle tree with a 1\u00d71 trunk, but the player can place them in a 2\u00d72 formation to grow a jungle tree with a 2\u00d72 trunk like the trees found naturally in the jungle biome.\n\nJungle bushes also generate in the jungle biome, featuring oak leaves and a single jungle log.\n\nA jungle tree.\n\nA mega jungle tree.\n\nA jungle bush.\n\nMain article: Acacia This section would benefit from the addition of isometric renders.\n\nPlease remove this notice once you've added suitable isometric renders to the article.\n\nThe specific instructions are: All acacia tree variants Acacias are found in the savanna biome.\n\nThey are about 8 blocks tall and feature unique diagonal trunks, and may occasionally have multiple canopies.\n\nAn acacia tree.\n\nMain article: Dark oak Dark oaks are found in the dark forest biome.\n\nThey have thick 2\u00d72 trunks.\n\nA dark oak always generates with dirt blocks under its trunk, even on a steep cliff.\n\nIrregular logs, representing large branches, are nearly always present and connected to the trunk.\n\nThe canopy of a dark oak filters enough light that a dense forest of them is sufficiently dark for hostile mobs to spawn during the daytime.\n\nA dark oak tree.\n\nAnother dark oak tree.\n\nMain article: Azalea tree Azalea trees generate on any empty space above a lush cave, with roots consisting of rooted dirt and hanging roots that reach down to the lush cave.\n\nThe tree usually appears at the surface, but they can generate inside caves if there is enough room and a lush cave below.\n\nAzalea trees can be manually grown by applying bone meal to an azalea or flowering azalea block (\"bush\").\n\nUnlike most trees, they do not have their own wood type (the trunks are composed of oak logs), but they have two types of leaf block: azalea leaves, and flowering azalea leaves.\n\nAn azalea tree.\n\nMain article: Mangrove Mangroves are found in muddy mangrove swamps, growing in water or on land.\n\nThey are grown from propagules, which can be found hanging from the trees.\n\nA mangrove converts any mud around it to muddy mangrove roots.\n\nThe wood has a deep red-orange color.\n\nA mangrove tree.\n\nMain article: Cherry Cherry trees are found in cherry groves.\n\nThey have distinct pink leaves and curved branches.\n\nThey also have a unique petal falling particle effect.\n\nA cherry tree.\n\nMain article: Pale oak Pale oaks are found in the pale garden biome.\n\nThey have thick 2\u00d72 trunks.\n\nMain article: Huge fungus Huge fungi come in many shapes and sizes, from really small to really huge.\n\nTheir trunks are composed of \"stem\" blocks which are nearly identical to wooden logs, except for being non-flammable.\n\nIn place of leaves they have nether wart blocks or warped wart blocks, with occasional shroomlights embedded within them.\n\nCrimson huge fungi often generate with weeping vines.\n\nHuge crimson fungi are found in the crimson forest biome; huge warped fungi are found in the warped forest biome.\n\nThey can be grown from crimson or warped fungus, placed on crimson nylium or warped nylium.\n\nTo grow into a huge fungus, the original fungus must be planted on the matching type of nylium, and then bone meal applied to it.\n\nA huge crimson fungus.\n\nA huge warped fungus.\n\nMain article: Huge mushroom While loosely defined as a tree, these are structures generated in certain biomes.\n\nInstead of logs and leaves, they consist of mushroom stems and mushroom blocks, which don't decay.\n\nWhen harvested without Silk Touch, they drop mushrooms.\n\nThey come in two variants, brown and red.\n\nA huge red mushroom.\n\nA huge brown mushroom.\n\nMain article: Chorus plant While loosely defined as a tree, these are structures generated on the outermost End islands.\n\nInstead of logs and leaves, they are instead comprised of chorus plant trunk blocks and flowers on the tip.\n\nThey do not drop their own block but instead chorus fruit.\n\nThey are usually extremely tall, with multiple branches.\n\nWhen the bottom of the chorus tree is cut, the whole chorus tree falls apart, dropping their fruit.\n\nThe branches are tipped with \"chorus flowers\", which do not drop when the tree is broken, but can separately be broken (and dropped) by any tool, bare hands, or the impact of any projectile.\n\nWhen a chorus flower is placed on End stone, it grows into a chorus tree over time \u2014 unlike most trees, this is a step-wise process as the chorus flower generates branches one block at a time.\n\nA chorus plant.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, trees can generate as one of the two following variants of the normal tree.\n\nBoth of these generate naturally, and can be grown out of normal saplings.\n\n[1] [2] The different dying tree types.\n\nThese trees have the standard growth pattern of any other tree, however, all exposed logs in the main trunk are covered with vines.\n\nThey can generate as dark oak, jungle, spruce, small oak trees or be grown from saplings.\n\nThese trees consist of a single upright log, or stump.\n\nLogs lying on their side are often found 1\u20132 blocks from the stump.\n\nOak, spruce, birch, tall birch, and jungle trees can generate as fallen trees.\n\nBirch Fallen Log Oak Fallen Log Spruce Fallen Log Jungle Fallen Log The \"cold-en\" oak was a tree formed by a rare glitch in older versions of Bedrock Edition prior to v0.9.0.\n\nIt was a small tree with a shape identical to that of a small oak or birch tree that is generated on the border of a forest and a snowy area (one of which is usually mountainous).\n\nIt was made of spruce leaves and spruce logs (seen in both the \"lite\" and paid versions prior to v0.9.0) or, rarely, oak logs (paid only).\n\nIts rarity is compared to the modified jungle edge.\n\nA cold-en oak tree recreated in Java Edition.\n\nA naturally generated spruce log cold-en oak, found in v0.8.1.\n\nMain article: Color Depending on where the tree generates, the color of the leaves may differ.\n\nFor example, if an oak tree is in a colder biome, such as a taiga or windswept hills biome, it has a blue-green hue.\n\nIn a snowy taiga, the leaves are white with a slight grey tint.\n\nHowever, if it is in a dry biome, such as a desert or savanna, it has a mustard yellow hue.\n\nSpruce, birch and cherry leaves do not follow these rules; they always have the same color regardless of the biome.\n\nFoliage color in wetter biomes.\n\nFoliage color in drier biomes.\n\nFoliage color in colder biomes.\n\nLeaves are checked individually for biome coloration rather than as part of a larger tree; as such, trees that were grown between biomes usually have multiple shades on each side.\n\nA tree grown between two biomes.\n\nA tree situated on the boundary of a jungle, swamp and desert biome, showing skins of all three on its leaves.\n\nAn acacia tree split between a savanna biome and a swamp biome.\n\nIssues relating to \"Tree\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nFloating trees may appear when small above-ground lava lakes generate in a forested area.\n\n[8] This happens since the tree is generated when the chunk loads first, before the lake appears underneath.\n\nThis leaves the tree floating above the lake, causing the tree to catch fire, potentially spreading to other trees and starting a forest fire.\n\nMega jungle trees and dark oak trees generate with dirt under them if they generate partly or wholly over air or water blocks.\n\nOak, spruce, birch, and acacia are all genera of trees.\n\nPine in forest in taiga biome.\n\nA floating tree, formed artificially after being set on fire with a Flint & Steel.\n\nA dying tree in a Pocket Edition.\n\nComparison of oak and fancy oak.\n\nA variety of tree types: From left to right, oak, birch, spruce, and jungle.\n\nA dark oak (left) and a mega jungle tree (right).\n\nAll of the trees and tree-like structures in the game as of 1.16.\n\nAn azalea tree in an old growth spruce taiga biome.\n\nA flaming spectral arrow stuck in an oak tree.\n\nMakena standing below a cherry tree.\n\nAn oak that was generated on a small floating body of land.\n\nAn oak that was naturally generated in a closed-over area of land, with light provided by a hole in the ceiling.\n\nAn oak generated in a cave, with light provided from lava spring.\n\nTrees can even generate in ravines.\n\nAnother oak in ravine.\n\nAn oak that generated in ravine, next to the lava spring and mineshaft.\n\nFancy oak generated right next to a lava lake and started to burn shortly after.\n\nAn oak generated on dirt in a erosion.\n\nSugar cane replaced leaves.\n\nA tree growing on a clay block, caused when the clay replaced the dirt.\n\nSpruce which generated under a cliff in windswept hills.\n\nSometimes, trees can grow through blocks placed by player.\n\nTree generated as a part of village house.\n\nArtwork of an oak tree with a chicken perched on the leaves.\n\nArtwork of a tree with a beehive.\n\nValentines artwork of the cherry tree.\n\n\u2191 https://web.archive.org/web/20190711143349/http://i.imgur.com/hTg0N8J.gifv \u2191 \"[MCPE-21304] Tree falled - Planted saplings sometimes grow as fallen trees - Jira\" \u2013 Mojira, April 16, 2017.\n\n\u2191 https://notch.tumblr.com/post/506311060 \u2191 http://www.peripheralarbor.com/minecraft/minecraftscriptphotojournal.html \u2191 https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1m97cw/while_you_are_all_crying_over_the_name_change_of/ \u2191 \"[MC-29844] Big Oak Trees fail to generate in Forest Biomes - Jira\" \u2013 Mojira, September 6, 2013.\n\n\u2191 \"[MC-163293] Leaves of acacia trees generate differently than before - Jira\" \u2013 Mojira, October 10, 2019.\n\n\u2191 MC-225839 Generated structures, features and terrain features View at: Template:Generated structures/content [edit ]",

naturally generated in jungles, swamps and lush caves.\n\nJungle trees of both sizes have vines on their trunks and canopy edges, and vines grow on the sides of jungle terrain.\n\nVines are also naturally generated on oak trees in swamps and mangrove trees.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, vines can also generate on dying oak, spruce, jungle and dark oak trees.\n\nVines are found in jungle temples and the allium room in woodland mansions.\n\nThey can also generate in watchtower walls in pillager outposts.\n\nVines generate on 2\u00d72 jungle trees grown from saplings, or mangrove trees grown from propagules.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, vines generate on dying trees, which can sometimes be grown from saplings.\n\nVines can be destroyed with any item, but using shears is the only way to collect them.\n\nShears enchanted with Efficiency are more efficient when used on vines; Efficiency II and above allows vines to be instantly broken.\n\n[1] Using an axe on vines can also increase efficiency, but does not allow for collection, even with Silk Touch.\n\nIf multiple vines exist within the same block space, breaking one of them breaks all of them instead of just the one targeted [2] and results in only a single vine dropping [3].\n\nShears used by a dispenser cannot break vines.\n\n\u2191 Times are for unenchanted tools as wielded by players with no status effects, measured in

vines can be placed in the same block space, as long as they are facing different directions.\n\nVines can be climbed by standing next to them and holding the jump key.\n\nIf there is a solid block behind the vines, the walk forward key can also be used.\n\nVines cancel a sprint if the player is sprinting, slowing the movement speed.\n\nVines absorb all fall damage, even without a solid surface

0.25 Blocks Height: 0.9875 Blocks Flamable Yes An armor stand is an inanimate entity that can wear armor.\n\nIt can also hold items and be posed (but these are not possible in Java Edition without commands).\n\nAn armor stand can be broken by quickly attacking it twice, dropping itself and any armor placed onto it.\n\nTwo armor stands are found in each taiga village outdoor armory, one equipped with an iron helmet, the other with an iron chestplate.\n\nPlayers can use armor stands to hold armor, mob heads, carved pumpkins, and elytra.\n\nCommands can be used to give them other items.\n\nThe stand does not have a GUI, so players interact with it directly.\n\nArmor stands are also able to be placed in different orientations, similar to banners or signs.\n\nArmor stands are entities, allowing them to be pushed by pistons, moved by flowing water, pulled with fishing rods, pushed by players (with knockback), and bounced by slime blocks.\n\nUsing armor on the stand places the armor if done on a bare spot.\n\nConversely, clicking on armor with a bare hand removes the armor and places it in the highlighted hotbar slot.\n\nIt is not possible to take or place items from the armor stand's hands unless playing on Bedrock Edition.\n\nArmor, mob heads, or carved pumpkins can be automatically placed on armor stands with a dispenser.\n\nArmor stands can be customized further to have arms, pose, disobey gravity, dual wield and other things by summoning them using / summon with NBT tags.\n\nIn maps heavily using command blocks, armor stands can be used to keep scoreboard objectives that are 'global' to the map, run commands, etc.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the pose of the armor stand can be changed by interacting with the armor stand (or pressing the Pose button on mobile devices) while sneaking, or by using a redstone signal.\n\nThere are 13 possible poses.\n\nArmor stands can also hold items by interacting with the armor stand (or pressing the Equip button on mobile devices) while holding an item that cannot be worn.\n\nBelow are the poses: Because armor stands are entities, they obey gravity, allowing them to fall and rest on non-full blocks such as enchanting tables, snow layers and slabs.\n\nAny armor on the stand drops when the stand is broken.\n\nArmor stands can display enchanted and all forms of dyed armor.\n\nThe effects of most enchanted armor have no effect when on an armor stand, with three exceptions: Frost Walker creates frosted ice blocks on water as usual if an armor stand is pushed with a piston.\n\nDepth Strider slows the movement of the armor stand when being pushed with water.\n\nA player may take damage from hitting an armor stand that holds armor enchanted with Thorns.\n\nArmor stands are not damaged by cacti but can be broken by arrows.\n\nAn armor stand destroyed by an explosion or a firework does not drop as an item.\n\nArmor stands in water and lava at the same time are not consumed by the lava.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, armor stands can be affected by status effects.\n\nThey can be 'killed' by Harming and Decay splash / lingering potions, lava, fire, and campfires, and they play the player death sound and fall to their side and disappear, yielding no armor stand item.\n\nIf an armor stand is equipped with an item or armor, that item or armor is considered as \"naturally-spawned equipment\" with an 8.5% chance of dropping when the armor stand \"dies\" from the Instant Damage or the Wither status effect.\n\nIf the dropped item is any form of weapon, tool or armor, it drops in a badly damaged state because the game considers it as \"naturally-spawned equipment\".\n\n[1] The stand wobbles slightly when being hit by the player.\n\nIn Java Edition, it is possible to create an armor stand with arms using the / summon command.\n\nIt is also possible to change an armor stand without arms into a stand with arms by using the / data command.\n\nThe commands are as follows: /data merge entity @e[type=armor_stand,sort=nearest,limit=1] {ShowArms:1}, which changes the nearest armor stand into an armor stand with arms.\n\n/summon minecraft:armor_stand ~ ~ ~ {ShowArms:1}, which summons a new armor stand with arms shown.\n\n/summon armor_stand ~ ~ ~ {Rotation:[0.0f]}, which summons a new armor stand that faces a desired direction (dependent on changing \"0.0f\" to other numbers like \"90.0f\" or \"180.0f\", otherwise it faces the same way as a default armor stand).\n\nJava Edition: Armor stands use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Main article: Player.dat format tag: The item's tag tag.\n\nEntityTag: Stores entity data that is applied to the entity when created.\n\nSee Entity Format.\n\nBedrock Edition: In Bedrock Edition, armor stands have no additional item tag.\n\nSee Bedrock Edition level format/Item format.\n\nArmor stands have entity data associated with them that contain various properties of the entity.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to mobs except LeftHanded, DeathLootTable, DeathLootTableSeed, NoAI, Leash, CanPickUpLoot and PersistenceRequired.\n\nTags common to all mobs DisabledSlots: Bit field allowing disable place/replace/remove of armor elements.\n\nFor example, the value 16191 or 4144896 disables placing, removing and replacing of all equipment.\n\nThese can be found using the bitwise OR operator.\n\nInvisible: 1 or 0 (true/false) -

Bedrock Edition has a version exclusive armor stand model, which includes posable arms.\n\nUsing redstone to change the stands reverse the poses, starting with the can-can pose first.\n\nPlacing the stand within three powered redstone dust always changes its pose to the honor pose.\n\nRepeaters also switch the stand to the honor pose if not set four blocks from one.\n\nUsing external tools, armor

[Java Edition only ] Once full, bee nests and beehives provide two harvestable products: honey and honeycomb.\n\nEach time a bee enters a nest or hive covered in pollen, it starts converting it to honey and honeycomb.\n\nAfter it is done, it waits for daylight with no rain (if necessary), then exits to go collect more pollen.\n\nWhen the bee exits, the nest or hive increments its honey level by 1, to a maximum of 5.\n\nOnce it is full, it changes its appearance to show honey oozing out and, if the block below it is not a full solid block, starts dripping honey particles (The dripping honey is decorative; it cannot be collected in a cauldron).\n\nThese changes signal that the hive or nest is ready for harvesting.\n\nTo harvest honey, the player uses a glass bottle on the nest or hive; the bottle then becomes a honey bottle.\n\nTo harvest honeycomb, the player uses shears on the nest or hive, causing it to drop three honeycomb items.\n\nAfter harvesting, the hive or nest is reset to empty (honey level 0, with the default appearance).\n\nAlternatively, honey or honeycomb can be harvested by powering a redstone dispenser containing either a glass bottle or shears.\n\nThe dispenser must be placed beside and facing the hive or nest.\n\nThis is the maximum distance a beehive can be from a campfire while applying the calming effect (5 blocks).\n\nHarvesting from a beehive or bee nest causes any bees inside it to become aggravated toward the player, unless there is a fire directly beneath it or a lit campfire within five blocks below, and the smoke is not obstructed.\n\nSmoke can pass through no more than one solid block, and only if that block is directly above the campfire.\n\nPlacing a carpet above the campfire leaves room for the bees to hover beneath the nest and still avoid taking fire damage.\n\nIn Java Edition, the smoke coming through the carpet also calms the bees.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a carpet is treated as an obstruction that removes the calming effect of the campfire's smoke.\n\nWithout a block covering the fire, the bees can still avoid fire damage if the campfire is placed 4\u20135 blocks below the nest.\n\nBeehives and bee nests have comparator output with a strength equal to the honey level in the block.\n\nOnce the beehive or bee nest is filled with honey it emits a signal strength of five.\n\nBeehives and bee nests can be placed under note blocks to produce bass sounds.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, beehives and bee nests can be used as fuel in a furnace, smelting 1.5 items per block.\n\nJava Edition: \u2191 a b MC-177082 Bedrock Edition: \u2191 MCPE-169612 \u2014 Many blocks make very slightly different sounds to stone Java Edition: \u2191 Can be 0.7 or 0.9 for each sound Bedrock Edition: \u2191 MCPE-53881 Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: \u2191 ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n\n\u2191 a b Available with / give command.\n\n\u2191 a b The block's direct item form has the same id as the block.\n\nJava Edition: Bedrock Edition: A beehive has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.\n\nJava Edition: See also: Block entity format Block entity data Tags common to all block entities Bees: Entities currently in the hive.\n\nAn entity in the hive.\n\nEntityData: The NBT data of the entity in the hive.\n\nSee entity format.\n\nMinOccupationTicks: The minimum amount of time in ticks for this entity to stay in the hive.\n\nTicksInHive: The amount of ticks the entity has stayed in the hive.\n\nFlowerPos: Stores the location of a flower, so other bees can go to it.\n\nX: X coordinate of the flower.\n\nY: Y coordinate of the flower.\n\nZ: Z coordinate of the flower.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Block entity format.\n\n|Bee nests now have a 2% chance to spawn in flower forests.\n\n|Bee nests now have a 0.2% chance to spawn in forest, wooded hills, birch forest, tall birch forest, birch forest hills, and tall birch hills biomes.}} Issues relating to \"Beehive\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nTutorials/Honey farming Artwork of Alex gathering honey from a beehive.\n\nArtwork of several bees near a bee nest.\n\nAn oak tree with a bee nest.\n\nA bee flying next to a bee nest.\n\n3 bee hives generated close to each other.\n\n2 beehives found close together, found in birch forest.\n\n\u2191 MC-160456",

campfires can also be extinguished by placing a water source or allowing water to flow in the space above the campfire.\n\nAs with torches, rain does not extinguish campfires.\n\n[1] Using flint and

can be placed on a single campfire, which cooks the items simultaneously.\n\nUnlike other blocks that can cook food, campfires do not require any kind of fuel to cook.\n\nOn a campfire, foods produce small smoke particles, indicating they are being cooked.\n\nFood items take 30 seconds (600 ticks) to cook, compared to 10 seconds for furnaces or 5 seconds for smokers.\n\nAssuming that one uses all four slots to cook at once, the Campfire is, therefore, more efficient than furnaces (taking 10 seconds less per four items and no fuel) for cooking, but must be watched so as to pick up the food and refill it once it is done.\n\nIt is slower than a smoker by about ten seconds, but its lack of fuel consumption could be seen as a worthwhile trade-off.\n\nOnce finished cooking, items pop off the campfire.\n\nIf the campfire is extinguished while cooking food, it resets as if it had not been cooked at all.\n\nFood items can be placed on an unlit campfire.\n\nOther items can be placed on campfires using external editors, mods or add-ons.\n\nCampfires do not have an external inventory.\n\nRaw food cannot be loaded into the campfire with a hopper.\n\nA hopper placed directly underneath

[Bedrock Edition only ] It can contain three levels of water.\n\nOne level of water can be added to a cauldron by using a water bottle on it.\n\nOne level of water can be removed from a cauldron, filling a water bottle, by using a glass bottle on it.\n\nA cauldron slowly fills with water when rained upon, if starting empty or with some water.\n\nThis happens randomly, at 5% of the rate in which snow accumulates on the ground during snowfall.\n\nWater can be stored in a cauldron even in the Nether.\n\nWater in a cauldron does not freeze in cold biomes.\n\nWater in a cauldron does not absorb explosion damage; make sounds and particles; absorb fall damage; [2] [3] allow Riptide tridents to activate; [4] [5] or damage endermen, striders, or blazes.\n\n[6] Cauldrons do not deal drowning damage to mobs inside of them [7] and fish act as if there is no water inside it.\n\n[8] The player cannot float or swim in it, as the water is about level with the player's waist.\n\nJumping in a cauldron does not produce any bubble or water particles.\n\nA cauldron placed below a down-facing pointed dripstone that has water placed a block above it slowly fills with water.\n\nThe same works with lava, allowing for infinite lava generation.\n\nAttempting to add lava or potion to water empties the cauldron. [Bedrock Edition only ] The water in a cauldron cannot be sucked up by a sponge, whether the sponge is touching the cauldron or not.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, leather armor is dyed through a cauldron, so a cauldron can hold dyed water.\n\nUsing a dye on a cauldron filled with water colors the water, consuming the dye.\n\nDifferent dyes may be added to produce mixed colors.\n\nUsing leather armor, leather horse armor, or wolf armor on the cauldron dyes that item the color of the water, reducing the water in the cauldron by one level for each item dyed.\n\nAttempting to add water, lava or potion to dyed water empties the cauldron.\n\nCauldron filled with lava Cauldrons can be used to hold lava.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, when a cauldron is already filled with water, it empties the cauldron and makes an extinguishing sound.\n\nA cauldron filled with lava emits a light level of 15, similar to lava, and burns any entity inside of it; in Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, this includes mobs that do not take damage from lava like zombified piglins.\n\nLava inside a cauldron does not interact with water outside of the cauldron.\n\nThe lava disappears upon putting water in the cauldron.\n\nA redstone comparator with a lava cauldron behind it outputs redstone signal strength of 3.\n\n[9] [10] A cauldron placed below a down-facing pointed dripstone that has lava placed a block above it slowly fills with lava.\n\nIf a cauldron is filled by lava, using glass bottles on the cauldron does nothing.\n\nPowder snow is currently the only solid material that can be stored in a cauldron.\n\nA cauldron slowly fills with powder snow during snowfall, if starting empty or with any layer of powder snow already inside.\n\nUp to three layers can be filled.\n\nWhen the cauldron is full, interacting using a bucket, creates a powder snow bucket and empties the cauldron.\n\nEntities standing in the cauldron do not take freeze damage, and entities wearing leather boots still fall through the powder snow.\n\nA redstone comparator with a powder snow cauldron behind it outputs a redstone signal strength proportional to the fill level, up to 3.\n\nContrary to a cauldron filled with water, a powder snow cauldron that is not full cannot be filled up with a powder snow bucket, as using the bucket on the cauldron instead places powder snow against it.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a cauldron can hold normal potions, splash potions and lingering potions.\n\nUsing a potion on a cauldron empties the potion and increases the level of the potion in the cauldron by one level.\n\nA glass bottle can then be used on a cauldron with a potion in it, filling the bottle with that potion.\n\nThis reduces the potion in the cauldron by one level.\n\nUsing an arrow on a cauldron that contains a potion transforms the arrow into a tipped arrow with that potion effect, and reduce the potion in the cauldron by one level.\n\nTipping multiple arrows at once can be more efficient, and it may use more than one level at once.\n\n1 level of potion tips up to 16 arrows, 2 levels up to 32, and a full cauldron can tip a full stack of arrows, resulting in 21.33 tipped arrows per potion.\n\nAttempting to put water, lava or a different potion into a cauldron with a potion causes an explosion sound, and the cauldron is emptied.\n\nAn entity that stands in a cauldron filled to any level with any potion does not receive the effect of the potion.\n\nUsing an empty bucket on a cauldron filled with any potion does nothing, as the bucket remains empty and the potion in the cauldron does not empty.\n\nA cauldron with water can wash the dye off of leather armor and shulker boxes, and can remove the top-most pattern layer of a banner, by pressing use on the cauldron with the leather armor, shulker box, or banner in hand.\n\nEach wash reduces the water in the cauldron by one level.\n\nThe water does not become dyed while removing dye from objects.\n\nIf a village has a cauldron that has not been claimed by a villager, any villager that does not already have a profession or job site block may change their profession to leatherworker.\n\nA cauldron with water or powder snow extinguishes entities on fire that fall into it and the entity emits black particles.\n\nThis includes mobs, players, items (if they land in the cauldron before burning up), and flaming arrows  [JE only ].\n\nFlaming arrows stuck into the side are also extinguished.\n\nEntities must reach the water or powder snow in it.\n\nEach entity extinguished causes the substance in the cauldron to decrease by one level.\n\nIf the cauldron is filled with powder snow, it then becomes a water cauldron.\n\nAn example of a cauldron used in a redstone circuit.\n\nSee also: Redstone circuit A cauldron can act as a power source for a redstone comparator.\n\nWith a cauldron behind it (either directly, or separated by an unpowered solid block), a comparator outputs a signal strength proportional to how full the cauldron is: 0 for empty, 1 for one-third full, 2 for two-thirds full, and 3 for completely full or filled with lava.\n\nHowever, if there is a block between the cauldron and the comparator, the comparator does not immediately update.\n\nJava

    "content": "For other uses, see Chest (disambiguation).\n\nChest Chest Large Chest Renewable Yes Stackable Yes (64) Tool Blast resistance 2.5 Hardness 2.5 Luminous No Transparent Partially Flammable No Catches fire from lava Yes A chest is a block used to store items.\n\nA large chest is the combination of two normal chests, and can store twice as many items.\n\nA chest can be broken using anything, but an axe is the fastest.\n\nChests always drop themselves when mined.\n\nIf the chest contains items, the items are also dropped when the chest is broken.\n\nIf one half of a large chest is destroyed, the corresponding items from the destroyed chest are dropped and the remaining half continues to function as a small chest.\n\n\u2191 Times are for unenchanted tools as wielded by players with no status effects, measured in seconds.\n\nFor more information, see Breaking \u00a7 Speed.\n\nSee also: Chest loot Chests generate naturally in all three dimensions.\n\nThey generate in monster rooms, strongholds, villages, jungle temples, desert temples, nether fortresses, end cities, igloos, woodland mansions, shipwrecks, ocean ruins, buried treasure, pillager outposts, bastion remnants, ruined portals, and ancient cities.\n\nLarge chests can occasionally generate in monster rooms by one single chest generating next to the other.\n\nThey can also generate in certain types of bastion remnants.\n\nMain article: Bonus chest The bonus chest is a chest that appears near the player's spawn if the \"Bonus chest\" option is toggled on the main menu.\n\nIt generates with a semi-random collection of basic items to help the player survive early on and gather necessary resources, including wood, tools, blocks, and food.\n\nChests can be used as containers and as crafting ingredients.\n\nTo place a chest, use the Place Block control on the face of a block adjacent to the space the chest should occupy.\n\nA chest placed adjacent to another chest joins to create a large chest.\n\nA player can prevent this, and place two small chests side by side, by sneaking while placing the second chest [JE only ], pushing a chest into place with a piston  [BE only ], or placing the second chest facing a different direction from the first chest.\n\nAlternatively, trapped chests do not combine with normal chests.\n\nChests can be moved by pistons, [BE only ] and water and lava flow around chests without affecting them.\n\nLava can create fire in air blocks next to chests as if the chests were flammable, but the chests do not actually catch fire and cannot be burned.\n\nThe GUI of a chest.\n\nThe GUI of a large chest.\n\nA small chest has 27 slots of inventory space, and a large chest has twice that amount, at 54 slots.\n\nIn the Java Edition interface, the top three rows for a large chest correspond to the left half of the chest when facing it, and the bottom three rows correspond to the right half.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the top three rows correspond to whichever half was placed first and the bottom three to the other half.\n\nChests open when used.\n\nTo move items between the chest inventory and the player inventory or hotbar while the chest GUI is open, drag or shift-click the items.\n\nHolding \u21e7 Shift and double-clicking while holding an item moves all items of the type clicked on in or out of the chest, to the extent that space is available for them. [Java Edition only ] To exit the chest GUI, use the Esc control.\n\nA chest cannot be opened if there is an opaque block above it (in Bedrock Edition, bottom-half slabs prevent chests from being opened).\n\nSolid faces do not prevent chests from opening, so the lid of the chest can phase through blocks such as bottom-half slabs, stairs, and transparent full cubes such as glass and ice.\n\nOcelots and cats sitting on chests prevent them from opening.\n\nBecause chests themselves are functionally transparent, two chests can be stacked on top of one another while still allowing the lower chest to be opened.\n\nPlayers can open chests when players are being hurt (effect of instant damage, poison, wither, fatal poison or on fire) or hurt by anyone (players, zombies, skeletons, etc.).\n\nBy default, the GUI of a chest is labeled \"Chest\" and the GUI of a large chest is labeled \"Large Chest\".\n\nA chest's GUI label can be changed by naming the chest in an anvil before placing it, or by using the / data command [Java Edition only ] (for example, to label a chest at (0, 64, 0) as \"Bonus Chest!\", use / data merge block 0 64 0 {CustomName:'\"Bonus Chest!\"'}).\n\nIf half of a large chest is renamed, that name is used to label the GUI of the entire large chest, but if the named half is destroyed the other half reverts to the default label.\n\nIf both halves of a large chest have different names, the GUI uses the name of the northernmost or westernmost half.\n\nIn Java Edition, a chest can be \"locked\" by setting its Lock tag using the / data command.\n\nIf a chest's Lock tag is not blank, the chest cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item with the same name as the Lock tag's text.\n\nFor example, to lock a chest at (0,64,0) so that the chest cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item named \"Chest Key\", use / data merge block 0 64 0 {Lock:\"Chest Key\"}.\n\nThe capacity of a chest varies greatly, depending on its size, whether the items inside it are stackable, and whether shulker boxes are used.\n\nThe minimum capacity is obtained when storing only non-stackable items while the maximum capacity can be achieved when storing items that stack to 64.\n\nFilled shulker boxes are not stackable, but each can hold 27 stacks of up to 64 items (excluding other shulker boxes), so filling a chest with them increases the maximum by a factor of 27.\n\nA chest can be added to a donkey, a mule, or a llama by pressing use on the respective animal.\n\nA chest attached to a donkey or mule has only 15 slots.\n\nA chest attached to a llama has anywhere from 3 to 15 slots depending upon its \"Strength\" value (see Llama \u00a7 Data values).\n\nThe chest cannot be removed except by killing the carrier.\n\nThe chest can be opened by holding sneak and pressing use, or by riding the carrier and pressing inventory.\n\nIf shulker boxes are again used, each donkey, mule or strength value 5 llamas with a chest attached to it can carry up to 405 stacks of items (up to 25920 items), and with strength value 5 llamas, each caravan of 10 llamas with inventories full of shulker boxes can carry up to 4050 stacks of items (up to 259200 items).\n\nPiglins become hostile toward players who open or mine chests.\n\nChests can be used as fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per chest.\n\nChests can be placed under note blocks to produce the \"bass\" sound.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Java Edition.\n\nOn December 24\u201326, chests, large chests, and their trapped chest counterparts have their textures changed to \"Christmas

[Java Edition only ] The GUI of the dispenser.\n\nA dispenser has 9 slots of inventory space.\n\nTo open the dispenser GUI, use the Use Item control.\n\nTo move items between the dispenser inventory and the player inventory or hotbar while the dispenser GUI is open, drag or shift-click the items.\n\nTo exit the dispenser GUI, use the Esc control.\n\nBy default, the GUI of a dispenser is labeled \"Dispenser\".\n\nA dispenser's GUI label can be changed by naming the dispenser in an anvil before placing it, or by using the data command [Java Edition only ].\n\nFor example, to label a dispenser at (0,64,0) \"My Dispenser\", use data merge block 0 64 0 {CustomName:'\"My Dispenser\"'}.\n\nA dispenser can be \"locked\" by setting the dispenser's Lock tag.\n\nIf a dispenser's Lock tag is not blank, the dispenser cannot be accessed except by players holding an item with the same name as the Lock tag's text.\n\nA dispenser's Lock tag can be set or unset with the data command.\n\nFor example, to lock a dispenser at (0,64,0) so that only players holding an item named \"My Key\" can access the dispenser, use data merge block 0 64 0 {Lock:\"My Key\"}.\n\nSee also: Redstone circuit A dispenser can be used to dispense its contents randomly.\n\nActivation A dispenser is a redstone mechanism and can be activated by: an adjacent active power component: for example, a redstone torch (except that a redstone torch does not activate a dispenser it is attached to), a block of redstone, a daylight sensor, etc.\n\nan adjacent powered opaque block (for example, a block with an active redstone torch under it) a powered redstone repeater or redstone comparator facing the dispenser powered redstone dust configured to point at the dispenser, or on top of it, or a directionless \"cross\" next to it; a dispenser is not activated by adjacent powered redstone dust that is configured to point in another direction.\n\nSome of these methods can activate a dispenser (in the sense of triggering an action) without powering the dispenser (in the sense of whether the dispenser can power adjacent redstone dust, etc.).\n\nIn addition to the methods above, a dispenser can also be activated by quasi-connectivity. [Java Edition only ] A dispenser becomes activated if one of the methods above would activate a mechanism component in the block above the dispenser, even if there is no mechanism component there (even if the block above the dispenser is air or a transparent block), but only when the dispenser receives a block update (including a redstone update within two blocks of the dispenser).\n\nA dispenser does not activate if it has been less than 1 redstone tick (2 game ticks, or 0.1 seconds barring lag) since its last activation ended.\n\nBehavior When activated, a dispenser waits for 2 redstone ticks (4 game ticks, or 0.2 seconds barring lag) and then ejects one item.\n\nThe dispenser does not continue to eject items while activated; ejection occurs only on the initial activation (the rising edge of an input signal).\n\nTo eject multiple items, repeatedly activate the dispenser with a clock circuit.\n\nIf the clock runs at faster than 5 Hz (more than 5 redstone pulses a second), the dispenser fires once and then locks in the \"on\" position.\n\nIf multiple slots are occupied by items, a random occupied slot is chosen for ejection.\n\nThe slot is chosen when an item is ejected, not when the dispenser is initially activated; thus it is possible to move items into or out of a dispenser between its activation and item dispensing.\n\nThe effects of being activated vary with the type of ejected item.\n\nMost items are thrown in the direction the dispenser is facing as if a player had used the Drop Item control.\n\n(Unlike a dropper, a dispenser can't feed another container.) Other items behave differently when dispensed, as described in the table below.\n\nIn general, a dispenser cannot place blocks into the world; the exceptions are shulker boxes, powder snow, [Java Edition only ] and certain cases where the placed block would do something unusual.\n\nThere are also a couple of special cases where an empty bottle or bucket can collect liquids from the world.\n\nWhen dispensing an item that has durability would cause the item to be used, such as with flint and steel and shears, the item's durability decreases.\n\nWhen a dispenser dispenses an item, it emits a clicking sound (unless the item is a projectile or a spawn egg) and a smoke particle.\n\nIf it is empty when activated, it emits a slightly higher-pitched click.\n\nThe noise of a dispenser can be heard up to 16 blocks away.\n\nA dispenser is a full solid opaque block, so powering it directly can cause adjacent mechanism components (including other dispensers) to activate as well.\n\nJava Edition: \u2191 a b MC-177082 Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: \u2191 a b c d e MC-98316 \u2014 Wrong subtitles caused by missing distinction Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: \u2191 ID of block's direct item form, which is used in savegame files and addons.\n\n\u2191 Available with / give command.\n\n\u2191 The block's direct item form has the same id as the block.\n\nSee also: Block states Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: A dispenser has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.\n\nJava Edition: See also: Block entity format Block entity data Tags common to all block entities CustomName: Optional.\n\nThe name of this container in JSON text component, which appears in its GUI where the default name ordinarily appears.\n\nItems: List of items in this container.: An item, including the slot tag.\n\nDispenser slots are numbered 0-8 with 0 in the top left corner.\n\nTags common to all items Lock: Optional.\n\nWhen not blank, prevents the container from being opened unless the opener is holding an item whose name matches this string.\n\nLootTable: Optional.\n\nLoot table to be used to fill the dispenser when it is next opened, or the items are otherwise interacted with.\n\n[note 1] LootTableSeed: Optional.\n\nSeed for generating the loot table.\n\n0 or omitted causes a random seed to be used.\n\n[note 1] \u2191 a b Both loot table tags are removed once the items have been generated.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Block entity format.\n\nFrame from first video of dispensers.\n\nThe first image released by Mojang showing the new vertical placement of Dispensers and Droppers.\n\nThe Dispenser can be seen on the top.\n\nNotes \u2191 Supposed time when fragment was filmed.\n\nBased on modified date of client.jar/gui/trap.png in Beta 1.2.\n\nIssues relating to \"Dispenser\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nA dispenser was shown inside a minecart in one of the 1.5 teaser images, although this was never added to the game.\n\nDispensers resemble a face when not facing up or down.\n\nDispensers can be placed facing up and down, as well as the side orientation.\n\nA distribution of arrows shot straight up by a dispenser.\n\nSome other blocks can also be used to move items: Droppers can throw items or push them into adjacent containers.\n\nHoppers can push items into adjacent containers.\n\nIce and packed ice have reduced friction to the item entity movement.\n\nSlime blocks can impart velocity to item entities when pushed by a piston.\n\nWater can push item entities.\n\nQuasi-connectivity Applies to Dispensers.\n\n\u2191 MCPE-80145 \u2191 a b c d e MC-114111 \u2191 MC-165196 \u2014 resolved as \"Invalid\".\n\n\u2191 \"Minecraft Snapshot 19w42a\" \u2013 Minecraft.net \u2191 MC-50259 \u2191 https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-80671?focusedCommentId=228546&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-228546 \u2191 MC-122844 resolved as \"Works As Intended\" Block of the Week: Dispenser \u2013 Minecraft.net on March 16, 2018 Redstone View at: Template:Redstone/content [edit ]",

[Java Edition only ] See also: Redstone circuit A dropper can be used to eject items, or push items into another container.\n\nActivation A dropper can be activated by: an adjacent active power component (Exceptions: a redstone torch does not turn ON a dropper it is attached to) an adjacent powered opaque block (strongly-powered or weakly-powered) a powered redstone repeater or redstone comparator facing the dropper powered redstone dust configured to point at the dropper, or on top of it, or a directionless \"dot\" next to it; a dropper is not activated by adjacent powered redstone dust that is configured to point in another direction.\n\nIn addition to the methods above, droppers can also be activated by quasi-connectivity. [Java Edition only ] A dropper activates if one of the methods above would activate a mechanism component in the block above the dropper, even if there is no mechanism component there (even if the block above the dropper is air or a transparent block), but only when the dropper receives a block update (including a redstone update within two blocks of the dropper).\n\nA dropper has a 2 redstone tick (4 game ticks, or 0.2 seconds barring lag) delay between activation and a response.\n\nDuring this time, additional inputs are ignored.\n\nBehavior See also: Tutorials/Item elevator \u00a7

activated \u2014 ejection occurs only on the initial activation (the rising edge of an input signal).\n\nTo eject multiple items, repeatedly activate the dropper with a clock circuit.\n\nIf multiple slots are occupied by items, a random occupied slot is chosen for ejection.\n\nThe slot is chosen when an item is ejected, not when the dropper is initially activated, thus it is possible to move items into or out of a dropper between its activation and item dispensing.\n\nIf the dropper is facing a container, the ejected item is transferred into the container.\n\nIf the container it is facing is full the dropper does not activate.\n\nOtherwise, the item is ejected in the direction the dropper is facing, as if a player had used the Drop control.\n\nEven items that would be treated differently by a dispenser (such as arrows) are simply ejected by a dropper.\n\nDispensers and droppers that are powered directly (or \"strongly powered\") are treated as full containers.\n\nThat is, a dropper will not activate to transfer its ejected item into a container if that container is a strongly powered dropper or dispenser.\n\nA dropper makes a clicking noise (the random.click sound event) when activated empty, when ejecting items into air, or when ejecting items into any block other than a chest type container or barrel or another dropper.\n\nIt is silent when it successfully transfers an item into any kind of chest or barrel, or another dropper.\n\nA dropper is an opaque block, so powering it directly can cause adjacent mechanism components (including other droppers) to activate as well.\n\nA line of droppers, each pushing items into the next dropper, is known as a dropper pipe.\n\nA dropper pipe must be clocked to move items, but can be clocked to move items faster than a hopper pipe's transfer rate.\n\nWhen a dropper pipe pushes items upward, it is known as a droppervator (short for \"dropper elevator\").\n\nEvery dropper activated by the same redstone signal will process its activity during the same game tick.\n\nHowever, the dropper that is directly powered will eject its item first, and then the adjacent droppers will eject their items.\n\nThe result is that, in a dropper pipe or droppervator, the item in the dropper that gets directly powered by redstone will move 2 spaces down the pipe.\n\nThis item will first get ejected by the directly powered dropper and then, on the same game tick, it will get ejected by the adjacent dropper.\n\nDroppers can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\n\nJava Edition: \u2191 a b MC-177082

Hardness 3.5 Luminous Yes (13) (when active) Transparent Partial (when active) Flammable No Catches fire from lava No A furnace is a utility block used for the smelting of blocks and items.\n\nFurnaces can be found in plains, desert, and some savanna village weaponsmiths.\n\nFurnaces also generate in some houses in snowy tundra villages, and in one of the taiga / snowy taiga  [BE only ] village houses.\n\nThey also appear in ancient cities and trail ruins, and one furnace generates in every igloo.\n\nA furnace can be mined using any pickaxe.\n\nA furnace will also drop all of its contents when broken, including XP from smelting items that were extracted by hoppers.\n\nIn Java Edition, a furnace mined without a pickaxe drops nothing.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a furnace drops itself when mined by hand or with any tool.\n\n\u2191 Times are for unenchanted tools as wielded by players with no status effects, measured in seconds.\n\nFor more information, see Breaking \u00a7 Speed.\n\nThe lit furnace can be obtained in Java Edition only with commands such as / give @s minecraft:furnace{BlockStateTag:{lit:\"true\"}}, although it does not appear lit in the inventory.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the lit furnace block can be obtained only by inventory editing.\n\nIt always stays lit, despite containing no items.\n\nFurnaces cannot be pushed by pistons in Java Edition.\n\nMain article: Smelting Interface for the Furnace.\n\nThe main purpose of a furnace is smelting.\n\nIts interface can be opened by pressing the use item button on it.\n\nA fuel source (up to one stack of fuel items) is placed in the lower slot, and the items (up to one stack) to be smelted are placed in the upper slot.\n\nA furnace smelts items at a speed of one item every 200 game ticks (10 seconds) or six items per minute.\n\nThe number of items that a fuel source can smelt depends on the type of fuel.\n\nAs soon as smelting begins, the fuel slot is decremented immediately and that unit of fuel begins burning.\n\nThe fuel continues burning until it is consumed, regardless of whether the upper slot has any items remaining to smelt.\n\nFor example, a piece of coal burns for 80 seconds and can smelt eight items, but if only one item is smelted (or if the item is pulled out before smelting is complete), the coal still continues burning for the full 80 seconds, wasting seven items worth of smelting.\n\nAfter it burns out, no additional fuel is decremented from the fuel slot if the upper slot is empty.\n\nIf the fuel slot is empty and the burning fuel is consumed before an item completes smelting, the smelting stops, the smelted item is unchanged, and smelting must be restarted with new fuel.\n\nLit Furnace Furnaces emit a light level of 13 when active, as well as smoke and flame particles.\n\nBy default, the GUI of a furnace is labeled \"Furnace\", but this name can be customized by naming it in an anvil before placing it, or by changing the CustomName tag using the / data command [Java Edition only ].\n\nIn Java Edition, a furnace can be \"locked\" by setting its Lock tag using the / data command.\n\nIf a furnace's Lock tag is not blank, the furnace cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item with the same name as the Lock tag's text.\n\nFor example, to lock a furnace at (0,64,0) so that the furnace cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item named \"Furnace Key\", use / data merge block 0 64 0 {Lock:\"Furnace Key\"}.\n\nFurnace can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\n\nJava Edition: \u2191 a b MC-177082 Bedrock

[Java Edition only ] Despite not being a solid block, attached blocks such as rails, levers, tripwire and redstone dust can be placed on top of hoppers, but not on their sides.\n\nHopper GUI showing the hopper's five slots of inventory at the top and the player's inventory below.\n\nA hopper can be used as a container and has 5 slots of inventory space.\n\nTo open the hopper GUI, use the Use Item/Place Block control.\n\nTo move items between the hopper inventory and the player inventory or hotbar while the hopper GUI is open, drag or shift-click the items.\n\nTo exit the hopper GUI, use the Esc key, B button or circle button, depending on the device.\n\nBy default, the GUI of a hopper is labeled \"Item Hopper\".\n\nA hopper's GUI label can be changed by naming the hopper in an anvil before placing it, or, in Java Edition, by using the data command (for example, to label a hopper at (0,64,0) \"Steve's Hopper\", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {CustomName:'\"Steve's Hopper\"'}).\n\nIn Java Edition, a hopper's GUI can be \"locked\" (or subsequently unlocked) by setting the hopper's Lock tag with the data command.\n\nIf a hopper's Lock tag is not blank, the hopper cannot be accessed except by players holding an item with the same name as the Lock tag's text.\n\nFor example, to lock a hopper at (0,64,0) so that only players holding an item named \"Steve's Key\" can access the hopper, use /data merge block 0 64 0 {Lock:\"Steve's Key\"}.\n\nA hopper can be used to craft a minecart with hopper.\n\nSee also: Redstone circuit and Redstone components \u00a7 Hopper Flowchart of hopper logic While a hopper is not powered by redstone signals, it operates with three functions: Collect item entities (free-floating items in the world) into its inventory from the space above it Pull a single item into its inventory from a container above it Push a single item from its own inventory into a container it faces A hopper first attempts to push any items inside it.\n\nAfterward, it checks if the block above it is a type of container.\n\nIf so, it attempts to pull from it.\n\nOtherwise, the hopper attempts to collect item entities.\n\nNotably, hoppers can push to and pull from other hoppers, forming hopper pipes or hopper chains, which allow transporting items across several blocks and are further discussed below.\n\nWhen a hopper receives a redstone signal (and is considered to be \"activated\"), all three functions stop.\n\nTo avoid confusion over the terms \"activated\" and \"deactivated\", powered hoppers are often described as being locked and unpowered hoppers described as being unlocked.\n\nHoppers can be powered by soft powered blocks, meaning a redstone dust trail pointing into a block touching the hopper locks it just as effectively as a redstone block or any other power component touching the hopper.\n\nWhen the hopper is unlocked during a redstone tick, it does not push or pull/collect during the same tick, but has a delay of 1 redstone tick instead.\n\nWhile a locked hopper does not push or pull/collect items, it may still receive items from dispensers, droppers and other hoppers, and may have its items pulled out by another hopper beneath it.\n\nHence, the item flow in a horizontal hopper pipe may be stopped by locking just one of the hoppers, but stopping a vertical hopper pipe requires locking two adjacent hoppers at the same time, such that both the pushing of the top one and the pulling of the bottom one are stopped.\n\nA hopper does not output any redstone signals by itself, but its fullness can be read using a redstone comparator, which needs to be placed next to it and facing away from it.\n\nAn empty hopper outputs a signal strength of 0 and a completely full hopper outputs a signal strength of 15.\n\nNotably, a single stackable item (16 or 64) outputs a signal strength of 1 and a single non-stackable item outputs a signal strength of 3.\n\nIn Java Edition, if the hopper being read is part of a horizontal hopper pipe, the comparator can individually read each item passing through the chain, because items are pushed through the hoppers one by one at a speed that is manageable by the comparator.\n\nIf there is an uninterrupted stream of items, the comparator does not switch off in between items.\n\nOn the other hand, in a vertical hopper pipe, some of the hoppers may never produce a reading above 0, even with a continuous stream of items, because pushes and pulls both occur in the same game tick: The hoppers' items get pulled out a single game tick after they're pushed in and this isn't measurable by a comparator, because comparators need measurements lasting at least 1.5 redstone ticks to produce a reading.\n\nA hopper collects items dropped on top of it if the space above the hopper not occupied by a storage block.\n\nItems are gathered from the entire 1 block space above the hopper, meaning that items sitting on partial blocks such as soul sand directly above a hopper can be collected.\n\n[1] It is also possible for a hopper to collect items from inside a full, solid block, a situation that might come from items rising up through solid blocks or being summoned.\n\nItem entities are not collected when they are outside of the collection area however; for example, items on top of a stone block directly above a hopper are not collected.\n\nCollected items are placed in the leftmost empty slot of a hopper's inventory.\n\nIn Java Edition, if there is no container above the hopper, then the hopper collects dropped items in the order in which they landed on the hopper.\n\nThis order is remembered even while a hopper is locked.\n\nFor instance, if a hopper is locked under a carpet while a fully equipped armor stand is broken above it, then it always collects items in this order when it is unlocked: armor stand, boots, leggings, chestplates, helmets.\n\nThis is due to the order in which these items land.\n\n[verify ] In Bedrock Edition, hoppers do not remember the order in which items land on the hopper.\n\nInstead, hoppers with multiple dropped items above them collect the items in the order in which they entered the chunk in which the hopper is located.\n\nItems that drop from a broken armor stand are collected in a random order.\n\n[2] Hoppers usually check for dropped items every game tick and they can collect items even before they are picked up by a player [verify ] or destroyed by lava.\n\nHowever, in Bedrock Edition hoppers have a \"collection cooldown\" time.\n\nAfter collecting an item (or stack of items), a hopper waits 4 redstone ticks (0.4 seconds, barring lag) before attempting to collect again.\n\nHoppers collect groups of items all at once rather than collecting them as single items one at a time.\n\nAs a result, hoppers can collect item entities much faster than they can pull items from a container.\n\nPulling from a moving minecart with chest or minecart with hopper is even slower, since the minecart is not always above the hopper.\n\nA hopper with a storage container above it (such as a furnace, chest, dropper, composter, or another hopper) attempts to pull from the container instead of checking for floating items above it, and hence can not collect items.\n\nA hopper always tries to push or pull items using the leftmost available slot.\n\nWhen a hopper is removing items from a chest, the items disappear from left to right.\n\nSimilarly, when filling up a chest, the chest fills up from left to right.\n\nHoppers prioritize pulling from the first slot of a container over pulling into the first hopper slot.\n\nIf a hopper has stone in its first slot and nothing in its second while the container it is pulling from has chicken in its first slot but stone in the second, the hopper pulls the chicken from the first slot of the container into its empty second slot.\n\nHowever, if the hopper is unable to pull the chicken, such as if all slots are filled with stone, the hopper pulls the stone from the second slot of the container instead.\n\nSimilarly, hoppers prioritize pushing from their first slot over pushing into the first slot of a container.\n\nIf a hopper has stone in its first slot and chicken in its second while the container it is pushing to has chicken it its first slot but stone in the second, the hopper pushes stone from its first slot into the second slot of the container.\n\nIn Java Edition the checks done by a hopper while pulling generally require less processing than the checks done by a hopper attempting collection.\n\nTherefore, a chain of hoppers topped with storage containers rather than air/solid blocks has better performance (measured as milliseconds of processing per tick) and lower potential for processing lag.\n\n[3] The performance improvement achieved is correlated with the number of storage slots the container has.\n\nPlacing composters (with no storage slots but still with custom output logic) on top of hoppers provide the greatest efficiency, while double chests actually degrade performance, even when sharing each double chest across two hoppers.\n\n[3] In Bedrock Edition a chain of hoppers with air or non-container blocks on top has better performance than a chain of hoppers topped by container blocks.\n\n[4] This may be because, even though hoppers with containers on top do not check for items, they do check for hopper-minecarts and chest-minecarts to pull from, and that involves scanning the chunk entity list.\n\n[5] A B Push then Pull Chest A is full of items while the hopper and Chest B are empty.\n\nItem pushes and pulls are processed in the same game tick, but pushes are processed before pulls.\n\nIn the schematic, the empty hopper first pulls an item from chest A as it cannot push anything into chest B.\n\nAfter the cooldown, the hopper first pushes its item into chest B before pulling another item from chest A, both pushing and pulling in the same tick, and the process repeats.\n\nThe hopper stops pulling when A is empty, and stops pushing when B becomes full.\n\nHoppers also have a \"transfer cooldown\" time.\n\nAfter pulling and/or pushing items, a hopper waits 4 redstone ticks (0.4 seconds, barring lag) before pulling or pushing again (a transfer rate of 2.5 items per second, barring lag).\n\nA hopper that has an item pushed into it from another hopper also starts a 4 tick cooldown period, regardless of whether it pushed or pulled items itself.\n\nItem entities can be collected at any time without affecting the transfer cooldown time.\n\nThe transfer cooldown and the Bedrock Edition collection cooldown are independent of each other.\n\nSome containers interact with hoppers in specific ways: Composter Hoppers above composters can push compostable items into the composter's top face with a chance of increasing the level of the composter as if the player used the item on the composter.\n\nItems that are not compostable cannot be pushed into the composter.\n\nHoppers below the composter can pull bone meal when the composter is in stage 8, emptying the composter and resetting it to stage 0.\n\nHoppers to the side of a composter do not interact with it.\n\nBrewing Stand A working hopper on the top face of a brewing stand deposits only into the ingredient slot and it can push only valid brewing ingredients.\n\nA hopper on side face of a brewing stand can deposit only blaze powder or filled bottles into the three brew slots.\n\nA hopper underneath a brewing stand always extracts from the three brew slots, whether brewing is finished or not\u2014The hopper must be locked to allow potions to finish brewing.\n\nChest Trapped Chest Large chests and large trapped chests are treated as a single container: A hopper depositing into a large chest fills up the entire chest and a hopper underneath a large chest empties the entire chest.\n\nTrapped chests being accessed by a player lock any adjacent hoppers, per the standard behavior of a hopper next to an active power source.\n\nFurnace Blast Furnace Smoker A working hopper pointing into top of a furnace deposits only into the ingredient slot.\n\nIt can push any item, including items that can't be smelted by the furnace.\n\nA hopper pointing into the side of a furnace deposits into the fuel slot, and only items that are usable as fuel.\n\nA hopper below a furnace pulls everything from the output slot and empty buckets from the fuel slot left over from using lava buckets as fuel.\n\nWhen a hopper removes items from a furnace, the experience points are 'stored' in the furnace until a player removes at least one smelted item, or the furnace block is broken.\n\nHopper A sequence of three or more hoppers, each pushing items into the next, is called a hopper pipe.\n\nWorking horizontal hopper pipes simply push items into each other at the expected rate of 2.5 items per second, but vertical hopper pipes are more complicated, as the hoppers are trying both to pull and to push.\n\nWhen a vertical pipe pulls from a single container, it simply transfers items at 2.5 items per second because the transfer rate is limited by the first hopper pulling items from the container.\n\nIf a stack of items is in a vertical pipe, the items can be transferred twice as fast, because the hopper with the item stack is pushing items down while the hopper below it is also pulling items down.\n\nMinecart with Chest Minecart with Hopper Unlocked hoppers fill chest minecarts and hopper minecarts if any part of the entity's hitbox is within the hopper's target block-space.\n\nHopper minecarts try to pull items from the hopper at high speed.\n\nHoppers can pull items from minecarts above them so rails can be placed directly on the top faces of a hoppers.\n\nIf a detector rail is in the right position, it could lock the hopper per standard redstone-hopper behavior.\n\nJukebox Hoppers can insert music discs into jukeboxes, and extract the music discs after they finish playing.\n\nShulker Box Hoppers cannot put shulker boxes into other shulker boxes.\n\nThis allows for the creation of certain item filters.\n\nOtherwise, hoppers interact with shulker boxes normally.\n\nLectern Hoppers cannot remove or place books on lecterns.\n\nThe redstone pulse emitted from a lectern when a page is turned can temporarily lock hoppers.\n\nEnder Chest Hoppers cannot interact with ender chests in any way.\n\nBarrel Dispenser Dropper Boat with Chest Hoppers interact normally with barrels, dispensers, droppers, and boats with chests.\n\nChiseled Bookshelf Hoppers and minecart with hoppers can insert and remove books from the bookshelf.\n\nAs with any other container, items are taken from the first slot that has an item that can fit in the hopper and are inserted into the first empty slot.\n\nJava Edition: \u2191 a b MC-177082 Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: \u2191 a b c MC-98316 \u2014 Wrong subtitles

block used to display and read written books from.\n\nIt also serves as a librarian 's job site block.\n\nEmpty lecterns can generate naturally in village libraries, up to two for some library variants.\n\nOne lectern generates as part of each ancient city, in the secret room at the city center.\n\nLecterns can be broken with any tool, but an axe is the fastest.\n\nLecterns drop themselves and the book they are holding.\n\n\u2191 Times are for unenchanted tools as wielded by players with no status effects, measured in seconds.\n\nFor more information, see Breaking \u00a7 Speed.\n\nLecterns can only be crafted using a normal bookshelf, not a chiseled bookshelf, and proper wooden slabs, not petrified oak slabs.\n\nLecterns are the job site block of librarian villagers.\n\nLibrarian villagers do not place books into lecterns.\n\nThey only stare at the lectern from less than a block away as \"working\".\n\nThe UI when reading a book on a lectern.\n\nLecterns can also hold a single book and quill or written book that other players can read at the same time.\n\nRight-clicking an empty one with a book and quill or written book places it.\n\nRight-clicking a lectern with a book already occupied opens an interface to read the book.\n\nBooks occupying a lectern can be retrieved through the interface, [Java Edition only ] punching the lectern [Bedrock Edition only ] or by destroying the lectern, even when / gamerule doTileDrops is false.\n\nLecterns cannot hold enchanted books or normal books.\n\nInstead, right clicking the lectern with an enchanted book or a normal book does nothing and the book won't be placed.\n\nIf a village has a lectern that has not been claimed by a villager, any villager has a chance to change their profession into librarian if that villager has not already chosen a job site block.\n\nLecterns holding a book emit a full-strength redstone pulse that is one game tick long (0.5 redstone ticks) when a page is turned.\n\nA redstone comparator also records book reading and sends a signal, depending on what page the player is currently on.\n\nBecause Bedrock Edition displays two pages of the book at once, the same signal strength increments require double the number of pages.\n\nFor Java Edition a book with only 1 page gives maximum signal strength, however page 1 always gives 1 signal strength if the book contains at least 2 pages.\n\nDue to this, to calculate the signal strength S {\\displaystyle S} of books with more than 1 page, use the following formula: S = \u230a 1 + 14 (P \u2212 1) M \u2212 1 \u230b {\\displaystyle S = \\left\\lfloor 1 + \\frac{14(P-1)}{M-1} \\right\\rfloor} Where \u230a \u230b {\\displaystyle \\lfloor \\, \\rfloor} is the \"floor\" operation (round down), M {\\displaystyle M} is the maximum number of pages the book on the lectern has, and P {\\displaystyle P} is the current page number the lectern is turned to.\n\nThis is most noticeable when a book has 2 pages where the signal strength is either 1 on page 1 or 15 on page 2.\n\nA book that would step up or down in increments of 1 per page would be 15 pages long.\n\nFor Bedrock Edition the formula is slightly different.\n\nDue to Bedrock Edition showing 2 pages at once and counting a change to the book's output only if the highest even numbered page contains information, a redstone comparator treats books with 3 pages the same as those with 1 or 2 pages of information, the same as how Java Edition would treat a book with just 1 page.\n\nFor 4 or more pages of information use the following formula to calculate signal strength.\n\nS = \u230a 1 + 14 (P \u2032 \u2212 1) M \u2032 \u2212 1 \u230b {\\displaystyle S = \\left\\lfloor 1 + \\frac{14(P'-1)}{M'-1} \\right\\rfloor} In this case M \u2032 {\\displaystyle M'} is half of the maximum page number rounded down, and P \u2032 {\\displaystyle P'} is half of the current highest page number containing data displayed on the book interface, rounded down.\n\nRounding down is required to eliminate the discrepancy caused by books containing an odd number of pages.\n\nFor example, a book with 8 pages gives a signal strength of 15 when looking at pages 7-8.\n\nA book with 9 pages has a signal strength of 15 when looking at either pages 7-8 and 9-10.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a book that steps up or down in increments of 1 per page turned must be exactly 30 pages long, with information left on page 30.\n\nLecterns can be used as fuel in furnaces to smelt 1.5 items.\n\nLecterns can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass\"

Renewable Yes Stackable No Tool Blast resistance 2 Hardness 2 Luminous No Transparent No Flammable No Catches fire from lava No A shulker box is a dyeable block that stores items, and, unlike all other storage blocks, keeps its contents in item form when broken.\n\nShulker boxes can be mined with any tool or by hand, but using a pickaxe is the most effective.\n\nShulker boxes drop themselves when mined.\n\nUnlike other containers, the contents of shulker boxes are stored within the dropped item, and not dropped separately.\n\nWhen instantly mined in Creative mode, shulker boxes drop as an item if there are items stored within, unless / gamerule doTileDrops is set to \"false\".\n\n\u2191 Times are for unenchanted tools as wielded by players with no status effects, measured in seconds.\n\nFor more information, see Breaking \u00a7 Speed.\n\nGUI of the shulker box.\n\nA shulker box has 27 inventory slots, the same as a chest.\n\nShulker boxes are portable chests: they keep their items when broken, which can be retrieved when placed again.\n\nThis is different from other containers, which drop their contained items as item entities when broken.\n\nA shulker box drops itself as an item if pushed by pistons or destroyed by an explosion.\n\nUnlike most blocks with inventory, shulker boxes always drop themselves when destroyed by explosions.\n\nWhen a shulker box with items inside is being held [Bedrock Edition only ] or is in a container's inventory, the items are listed on the tooltip as properties.\n\nItems inside the shulker box are listed below the block type properties.\n\nA shulker box's items can be fed or removed by a hopper.\n\nShulker boxes can be stored in all containers except for other shulker boxes and bundles.\n\nWhen placed on a wall or ceiling, shulker boxes face and open sideways or upside-down, respectively.\n\nShulker boxes cannot be opened if a solid opaque block is on their top surface, similar to a chest.\n\nFor example, if a shulker box is facing upside-down and a solid opaque block is below it, the shulker box cannot be opened.\n\nA shulker box can also be placed using dispensers.\n\nLike a chest, a shulker box requires a transparent area above to be opened, and it opens only if the hitbox of the top of the open shulker box does not intersect with another hitbox.\n\nThis way, a shulker box can be opened with an upside-down slab or an upper trapdoor on top of it.\n\nIt is also unique in that when opened, its hitbox expands to 1.5 blocks high/wide, physically pushing entities where it is facing.\n\nBy default, the GUI of a shulker box is labeled \"Shulker Box\", which can be changed by naming it in an anvil or by changing the CustomName tag using the / data command [Java Edition only ].\n\nWhen a shulker box item is destroyed, the contents of the shulker box are dropped as items.\n\nDyed shulker boxes can be undyed using a cauldron.\n\nTo do this, use a dyed shulker box on a cauldron that has water in it.\n\nThis causes the cauldron's water level to decrease by 1, and the shulker box loses its dye color.\n\nPiglins become hostile toward players who open or mine shulker boxes.\n\n[1] Java Edition:

[Bedrock and Java editions only ] Alternately, normal chests do not combine with trapped chests.\n\nTrapped chests can be moved by pistons. [Bedrock Edition only ] Water and lava flow around without affecting them.\n\nLava can create fire in air blocks next to trapped chests as if they were flammable, but the chests do not burn (and cannot be burned by other methods either).\n\nTrapped chests can also activate buried TNT, destroying themselves, their contents and any mobs or players near them.\n\nThey need to be opened twice for the TNT to be activated.\n\nThe GUI of a trapped chest.\n\nThe GUI of a large trapped chest.\n\nA single trapped chest has 27 slots of inventory space, and a large trapped chest has 54 slots of inventory space.\n\nIn a large trapped chest, the top three rows in the interface correspond to the western or northern chest block and the bottom three to the southern or eastern chest block.\n\nTo open the trapped chest GUI, use the Use Item control.\n\nTo move items between the trapped chest inventory and the player inventory or hotbar while the trapped chest GUI is open, drag or shift-click the items.\n\nTo exit the trapped chest GUI, use the Esc control.\n\nBy default, the GUI of a trapped chest is labeled \"Chest\" and the GUI of a large trapped chest is labeled \"Large Chest.\" A trapped chest's GUI label can be changed by naming the trapped chest in an anvil before placing it, or by using the data command [Java Edition only ] (for example, to label a trapped chest at (0, 64, 0) \"Loot!\", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {CustomName:'\"Loot!\"'}).\n\nIf half of a large trapped chest is renamed, that name is used to label the GUI of the entire large trapped chest, but if the named half is destroyed, the other half reverts to the default label.\n\nIf both halves of a large trapped chest have different names, the GUI label takes the name of the northernmost or westernmost half of the large trapped chest depending on its orientation (the half with the lowest coordinate in the appropriate axis).\n\nA trapped chest can be \"locked\" by setting the trapped chest's Lock tag.\n\nIf a trapped chest's Lock tag is not blank, the trapped chest cannot be opened except by players holding an item with the same name as the Lock tag's text.\n\nA trapped chest's Lock tag can be set or unset with the data command.\n\nFor example, to lock a trapped chest at (0, 64, 0) so that only players holding an item named \"Alice's Key\" can open the trapped chest, use data merge block 0 64 0 {Lock:\"Alice's Key\"}.\n\nChests (left) and trapped chests (right) can be placed next to each other.\n\nRedstone dust configures itself to point toward trapped chests, but not toward regular chests.\n\nSee also: Redstone circuit Trapped chests can be used to detect when their inventory is accessed by players.\n\nA trapped chest is inactive while not being accessed, but activates when accessed by a player (see above).\n\nAccessing either part of a large trapped chest activates both halves of the large trapped chest.\n\nMobs cannot access/activate a trapped chest, and a trapped chest is activated by items moving into or out of it by droppers or hoppers.\n\nWhile active, a trapped chest: powers any adjacent redstone dust, including beneath the trapped chest, to a power level equal to the number of players accessing the trapped chest (maximum 15) powers any adjacent redstone repeaters facing away from the trapped chest to power level 15 strongly powers any full solid opaque block (stone, dirt, block of gold, etc.) beneath the trapped chest to a power level equal to the number of players accessing the trapped chest (maximum 15) activates any adjacent mechanism components, including above or below, such as pistons, redstone lamps, etc.\n\nDue to hoppers being locked by redstone activation, hoppers below a trapped chest do not take items from it while it is open.\n\nAn active trapped chest does not power any adjacent redstone comparators facing away from it.\n\nRedstone comparators can measure the block state of the trapped chest, producing a power level from 0 to 15 proportional to how full the trapped chest is.\n\nAnything else powered by an active trapped chest (including a block beneath it) can power redstone comparators normally.\n\nPiglins become hostile toward players who open, break or interact with trapped chests.\n\nTrapped chests can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per chest.\n\nTrapped chests can be placed under

    "content": "Bucket of aquatic mob Cod Salmon Tropical Fish Pufferfish Axolotl Tadpole Rarity Common Renewable Yes Stackable No A bucket of aquatic mob is a small aquatic mob (a fish, axolotl, or tadpole) inside of a water bucket, obtained by using a water bucket on one of these mobs.\n\nA bucket of aquatic mob can be obtained by using a water bucket on an applicable mob.\n\nOnce a water bucket is used, the mob is picked up along with the water source block.\n\nThe mob bucket obtained corresponds to the mob picked up.\n\nWandering traders have 1 \u2044 6 chance to either sell a bucket of pufferfish or a bucket of tropical fish for 5 emeralds.\n\nNovice-level Fisherman villagers have a 50% chance to sell a bucket of cod for 3 emeralds.\n\nPressing use with a bucket of aquatic mob places a water source block, and spawns the mob back into the world, leaving an empty bucket in the player 's inventory.\n\nFor buckets of tropical fish, the fish and its details (color, size, name) are kept.\n\nPlacing a bucket of aquatic mob in the Nether causes the same particles to appear that generate when a normal water bucket is placed in the Nether, and the fish is spawned alone.\n\nMobs caught in buckets then released do not despawn, unlike mobs that spawn naturally in their aquatic environments.\n\nIf a bucket of aquatic mob is inside a dispenser, the dispenser spawns the mob and water block in front of it upon activation, leaving an empty bucket inside.\n\nDispensers cannot pick up mobs with water buckets (the bucket is emptied).\n\nIf a bucket of aquatic mob is named a certain name through an anvil, the mob inside display that name as if it were named with a name tag, making fish, axolotls, and tadpoles the only mobs that can exist in item form, and be named without a name tag. [Java Edition only ] Alternatively, if a named mob is captured with a bucket of water, the resulting mob bucket shares a name with the captured mob. [Java Edition only ] If a named mob is captured in Bedrock Edition, the item is called \"Bucket of <Name>\".\n\nTropical fish also have assigned names that can be seen after capture.\n\nIn Java Edition, the smaller text under the item name is displayed showing the fish name, similar to the text that displays enchantments under enchanted items.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the item name is displayed showing \"Bucket of <fish name>\".\n\nTheir colors are mostly named according to the colored block names, though with a few exceptions: White Silver Gray Black Brown Red Orange Yellow Lime Green Teal Sky Blue Plum Magenta Rose The base color comes first, and if the pattern color is different, it comes after that.\n\nLastly, the fish bucket is given a name according to the shape and pattern of the fish: Some tropical fish don't follow the normal naming system, and instead, reference real-life fish species.\n\nApart from these names, these types of fish aren't different from regular tropical fish in terms of design or behavior.\n\nThese varieties are: A bucket of tropical fish purchased from a wandering trader or pulled from the Creative inventory spawns random tropical fish when used, due to it having no associated NBT.\n\nAdditionaly, buckets of tropical fish may be used to lead and breed axolotls.\n\nIt can also speed up the growth of a baby axolotl.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, if an axolotl is picked up with a bucket, the bucket appears in the player's inventory as \"Bucket of <Baby/Adult> <Color> Axolotl\" based on the age and color of the axolotl.\n\nThese varieties are: Bucket of Baby Leucistic Axolotl Bucket of Adult Leucistic Axolotl Bucket of Baby Brown Axolotl Bucket of Adult Brown Axolotl Bucket of Baby Gold Axolotl Bucket of Adult Gold Axolotl Bucket of Baby Cyan Axolotl Bucket of Adult Cyan Axolotl Bucket of Baby Blue Axolotl Bucket of Adult Blue Axolotl When the player spawns in an axolotl with a bucket of axolotl from the creative inventory, it is always a leucistic adult.\n\nBuckets containing other variants will always spawn that variant when used in creative mode.\n\nThe bucket of axolotl does not change textures in the inventory to reflect the captured axolotl's color, it always appears leucistic.\n\nWhen a tadpole is picked up with a bucket, the bucket appears in the player's inventory as \"Bucket of tadpole\".\n\nThe bucket can be emptied again like any other bucket of aquatic mob, depositing the tadpole and water on the targeted location.\n\nThe water in the bucket of tadpole appears green, unlike the other buckets of aquatic mobs, in which water appears blue.\n\nJava Edition: Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Main article: Player.dat format tag: The item's tag tag.\n\nBucketVariantTag: The variant data of the tropical fish in the bucket.\n\nApplies only to Bucket of Tropical Fish.\n\nEntityTag: Stores entity data that is applied to the aquatic mob when it is poured out.\n\nIf this data includes a tropical fish variant, it overrides the one provided in BucketVariantTag.\n\nSee entity format.\n\nNormal buckets of fish use only the BucketVariantTag tag to store the variant of any tropical fish that is picked up, and the item's display name to store the fish's custom name.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Item format.\n\nTeaser for bucket of axolotl and powder snow.\n\nTeaser for bucket of axolotl and powder snow.\n\nFirst image of a bucket of tadpole.\n\nIssues relating to \"Bucket of Fish\", \"Bucket of Mob\", \"Bucket of Cod\", \"Bucket of Salmon\", \"Bucket of Pufferfish\", \"Bucket of Tropical Fish\", or \"Bucket Of Tadpole\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nWhen a water bucket is transformed into a bucket of aquatic mob, it actually pushes the bucket texture down one pixel.\n\nAccording to Dinnerbone, JAPPA says this is due to the \"weight of the fish\".\n\n[2] Buckets of tropical fish always appear to contain a clownfish, regardless of whatever fish is actually inside.\n\n[3] The bucket of cod and bucket of tropical fish are actually re-colorations of each other.\n\n\u2191 MC-130015 \u2191 MC-127919 \u2191 MC-126761 Taking Inventory: Bucket of Fish \u2013 Minecraft.net on March 26, 2020 Taking Inventory: Bucket of Axolotl \u2013 Minecraft.net on July 14, 2022 Items View at: Template:Items/content [edit ]",

[Java Edition only ] If the firework rocket has no explosion effect, it deals no damage.\n\nThe explosion of a firework rocket deals 5 to 6 points of damage, with one firework star.\n\nThe explosion has a radius of roughly 4 blocks, which is unaffected by the firework star's effect.\n\nEach additional firework star on the rocket deals an additional 1 to 2 points of damage, for a maximum of 11 \u00d7 5.5 to 18 \u00d7 9 with 7 firework stars.\n\nThe flight duration of the firework increases the maximum range the firework can travel before exploding, but does not affect the damage output.\n\nLikewise, the damage remains the same regardless of any dyes used.\n\nUnlike an arrow shot from a bow, the firework does not slow down under water.\n\nFireworks crafted without firework stars shot from crossbows upon contact with terrains, slide on them.\n\nThey continue their original trajectories as soon as they break contact from the blocks they slid on.\n\nCrossbows can be repaired in an anvil or grindstone by combining two crossbows.\n\nAny loaded ammunition is retained from the crossbow in the first slot but sacrificed from the crossbow in the second slot.\n\nMultishot and Piercing are mutually exclusive.\n\nNormal methods of enchanting allow only one of them to be applied to a crossbow.\n\nCrossbows have a base enchantability of 1.\n\nEnchantments specific to crossbows include Quick Charge, Multishot and Piercing.\n\nCrossbows can be used as fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per crossbow.\n\nJava Edition: \u2191 quick1_3 occurs at half the frequency as the other sounds \u2191 0.325 for all except quick1_1 (pitch=0.9), which is 0.25 \u2191 quick1_1 can be 1.0 or 0.9; quick1_2 can be 1.0 or 0.95; quick1_3 can be 1.0 \u2191 a b _1 occurs at 2 \u2044 3 the frequency as the other sounds \u2191 a b 0.325 for all except _1 (pitch=0.95), which is 0.25 \u2191 a b _1 can be 1.0 or 0.95; _2 can be 1.0, 0.95, or 1.05; _3 can be 1.0, 0.9, or 1.05 \u2191 loading_middle4 occurs at 1 \u2044 4 the frequency as the other sounds \u2191 loading_middle1 can be 1.0, 0.95, or 1.2; loading_middle2 and loading_middle3 can be 1.0, 0.9, or 1.05; loading_middle4 can be 1.0 \u2191 a b MC-203146 \u2191 Multiplied by the loading percentage of the crossbow Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Main article: Player.dat format tag: The tag tag.\n\nChargedProjectiles: The items this crossbow has charged, normally one entry (three if enchanted with multishot): A charged item.\n\nTags common to all items Charged: If the crossbow is charged.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Item format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Crossbow\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nAlongside pillagers, crossbows were inspired by Minecraft Dungeons, even though they were added in the base game first.\n\n[2] Crossbows enchanted with Quick Charge VI and above get stuck on the first frame on the recharging animation because the resulting charge time is negative, and the game never reaches the time markers that tell it to advance the animation or the reloading procedure itself.\n\nIt is technically possible to charge such crossbows, but this would require overflowing the value that determines how long the crossbow has been charged.\n\nThis takes such an amount of time that this is practically impossible: for example, charging a crossbow with Quick Charge VI would take 69.4 years to complete.\n\nAlthough Piercing allows arrows to bypass shields, they can't get through the wither armor.\n\nThe crossbow's first-person loading animation in Bedrock Edition is different from Java Edition.\n\nEven if a crossbow is already wound with a projectile, when it drops on the ground, it always looks uncharged.\n\n[3] In real life, crossbows don't shoot the same arrows as bows, rather they shoot shorter, thicker, and oftentimes fletchless arrows (usually called \"bolts\") made to withstand the crossbow's increased power, which can shatter conventional arrows.\n\nA crossbow shown at MINECON Earth 2018.\n\nA pillager armed with a crossbow, shown at MINECON Earth 2018.\n\nHow the crossbow is equipped.\n\nAn enchanted crossbow.\n\nSteve charging crossbow in Java Edition.\n\nAlex charging crossbow in Java Edition.\n\nPillager charging crossbow.\n\nPiglin charging crossbow.\n\nThe Minecraft Dungeons variant of the crossbow \u2191 MC-111738 \u2191 \"March 2021 developper Q&A\" \u2013 discord.com, March 11, 2021.\n\n\u2191 MC-137552 Taking Inventory: Crossbow \u2013 Minecraft.net on October 20, 2022 Items View at: Template:Items/content [edit ]",

[Bedrock Edition only ] Elytra have a minimum speed of about 7.2 m/s (obtained by gliding at the altitude cap with a strong upward pitch of 30\u00b0).\n\nIf the diver drops to 0 speed, they quickly get accelerated back up to at least this minimum.\n\nThe diver can increase speed by choosing to descend faster, but afterward, they do not regain nearly as much altitude.\n\nIn the real world, drag increases with speed, and drag, in turn, slows the aircraft; Minecraft mimics this.\n\nTo glide from cliff to cliff, a player's best bet is to aim slightly above the horizon.\n\nSharp turns are a fast way to lose speed.\n\nQuicker turns cause greater losses, while gentle movements have small effects.\n\nMaking a hairpin turn can actually be used for making high-speed landings safe as well as for precise landings on small targets like rooftops.\n\nThe player aims to glide just above the target, then as they're right over it they immediately reverse directions, then they make readjustments as necessary.\n\nThe lowest rate of altitude loss is about 1.5 m/sec, obtained by gliding at the altitude cap with a slight upward pitch (12\u00b0 or 15\u00b0).\n\nTo get the best possible glide ratio (and thus the furthest distance out of their altitude), the diver pilot should aim directly at the horizon.\n\nThis ratio is about 9.47 to 1.\n\nSlow Falling potions greatly decrease the player's vertical (fall) speed, which also greatly decreases their horizontal speed (clearly, it depends on the vertical fall rate, as one might expect from flight modeling).\n\nThe net result is that the player flies extremely slowly - but their elytra still takes durability damage at the usual rate (1 durability per second without Unbreaking, etc.).\n\nDue to this combination, elytra plus Slow Falling is largely a novelty that most players won't use.\n\nThe Feather Falling enchantment does not affect elytra speed and does not reduce fall damage from hitting things with elytra.\n\nIt is possible to calculate the glide range by dividing the altitude by tan of the glide angle (altitude/tan(glide angle)).\n\nFor example, if the player glides from an altitude of 64 blocks above ground with a glide angle of 15 degrees, they can glide for 237 blocks (assume that they are on superflat), since floor(64 / tan(15\u00b0)) is 237.\n\nTrying for too high a pitch reduces the player's lift.\n\nAt a pitch of 30\u00b0 above the horizon, the player has the lowest possible airspeed of 7.2 m/sec.\n\nAbove that, the player might be considered to be in a stall.\n\nIncreasing the pitch gets closer to a free-fall, and stalled flight at 60\u00b0 is enough to cause fall damage.\n\nStalling at 90\u00b0 is a true free-fall.\n\nRecovering from a stall is done by readjusting to any safe pitch as quickly as the player likes.\n\nThis can be just changing to look at the horizon.\n\nFirework rockets are used for speed boosts while gliding.\n\nFirework rockets can be used for propulsion during flight by placing it in either hand and using.\n\nUsing a firework rocket while gliding quickly maximizes the player's speed for a time similar to the rocket's flight duration.\n\nIf the rocket is equipped with firework stars, it explodes at the end of its flight, inflicting damage based on the number of stars.\n\nIt is possible to gain altitude during powered flight.\n\nThis makes it possible to glide for extreme distances and had been used extensively by Far Lands / world border challenges.\n\nA broken pair of elytra.\n\nDurability decreases by one point each second when gliding.\n\nA pair of elytra has 432 durability, allowing 7 minutes and 12 seconds of gliding time without enchantments, providing more than 10,000 blocks of transport distance.\n\nIt is possible to apply the Unbreaking enchantment using an anvil and an enchanted book, which affects the elytra, in the same way it does to tools.\n\nUnbreaking III increases elytra's flight time to about four seconds per durability point, a total of 28 minutes and 44 seconds.\n\nWhen the durability reaches 1, elytra stop working until they are repaired, adopting a tattered texture in the inventory.\n\nThe damage ends at durability 1, so they can never fully break.\n\nA pair may be repaired by either using the Mending enchantment, combining two pairs in a grindstone, or combining it in an anvil with phantom membranes.\n\nIn an anvil, each piece of membrane repairs elytra by 108 durability points, requiring 4 pieces to fully repair them.\n\nEach repair on the anvil will also increase the prior work penalty for the Elytra, making every subsequent repair increasingly expensive, with an upper limit where repairs are no longer allowed because they are \"too expensive\".\n\nHowever, the prior work penalty can be reset to 0 for an enchanted elytra pair when it is disenchanted on a grindstone (by adding nothing to it).\n\nUnenchanted elytra cannot be used on the grindstone alone.\n\nElytra can receive the following enchantments by combining in an anvil: Java Edition: \u2191 Is a quarter of the player's velocity.\n\nIf flying for less than 1 second, it is 0.0; otherwise, if flying for less than 2 seconds, it is between 0.0 and a quarter of the player's velocity (scaling up with time until 2 seconds) \u2191 If the volume is greater than 0.8, 0.8-volume is added to the pitch \u2191 a b MC-177084 Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Issues relating to \"Elytra\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nIn reality, elytra are not used for flight.\n\nThey are the tough forewings of beetles and earwigs that cover the wings they actually use for flight.\n\nHowever, like Minecraft elytra, beetles can use them for gliding.\n\nThe singular form of elytra is an elytron.\n\nMany people say it like https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:ElytraWrong.wav /\u02c8i la\u026a tr\u0259/ ee-LYE-tr\u0259, LYE like the drain cleaner, or https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:ElytraPronunciation.mp3 /\u02c8\u0259 li\u02d0 tr\u0259/ ee-LEE-tr\u0259, LEE as in \"leech\" or \"leave\".\n\nThey also treat \"elytra\" as a singular noun, saying \"AN e\"lye\"tra\", or \"two E\"lye\"tras\", with the \"an\" article, or the \"-s\" ending, which is incorrect, as \"elytra\" is a plural word, and is the plural of \"elytron\".\n\nFor the correct grammar, think of how you would use the word \"wings\" in a sentence and replace it with elytra.\n\nFor example: \"I need to find some wings\" -> \"I need to find some elytra\", not \"AN elytra\" as you wouldn't say \"an wings\" or \"an apples\".\n\nA flying player has a shorter hitbox than usual: A 0.6 block cube centered on the player's feet.\n\nIt is possible to glide while on a ladder, by pressing \u21e7 Shift followed by space, causing the player to fall with a speed determined by the player's visual angle.\n\nThis means that the player can descend fast on a ladder, but if the speed is too fast when hitting the ground, they can take fatal fall damage.\n\nUsing a firework rocket can also speed up the player's descent.\n\nIn Java Edition if the player glides into deep water with elytra equipped, the animation does not stop, giving it the appearance of a swimming animation.\n\n[3] The animation stops once the player touches the ground.\n\nAdditionally, firework rockets can be used with elytra underwater with a short boost duration.\n\nElytra do not deactivate when the player flies into lava.\n\n[3] Elytra can be equipped onto some mobs using commands.\n\nThis has no effect unless the mob has the FallFlying tag set to 1b.\n\nMobs glide forward, unable to control the movement before landing, at which time they regain their AI.\n\nExceptions to this are squids as the squid's AI causes it to attempt swimming in midair, making it fall straight down because it conflicts with the elytra mechanics.\n\nBecause chickens fall slowly, they can move more distance.\n\nEndermen, tamed wolves and tamed cats that are not sitting cannot teleport until they hit the ground.\n\nBecause mobs do not regain control until they hit the ground, vexes fall until they die or despawn as they cannot touch the ground.\n\nMobs capable of flying, such as parrots or vexes can steer in air, though they cannot travel up or down.\n\nDolphins also have this ability.\n\n4J Studios created an elytron-centered tutorial map for console edition when elytra were first introduced to this platform, this map is themed as \"ruins of an ancient civilization of Minecraft worshipers\" and showcases the new amplified terrain generation.\n\nThis map can be seen behind the scenes.\n\n[4] On 28 March 2017, 4J Studios added an elytron-themed Mini Games for console edition called \"Glide;\" it consists of Time Attack and Score Attack mode.\n\n[5] [6] A player who jumps with both elytra and the Slow Falling effect travels slightly upward, which is a cheap but time-consuming alternative to fireworks and Riptide -enchanted tridents.\n\nOn May 5, 2019, Mojang tweeted ' The End never yields enough adequate resources, sadly,' along with a sad emoji.\n\n[7] The

rod is a tool that casts a bobber used to fish in water or to hook and pull mobs, items and some entities towards the user.\n\nEnchanted fishing rods can be obtained as \"treasure\" items from fishing, and unenchanted ones as \"junk\" items.\n\nJourneyman-level fisherman villagers sell enchanted fishing rods for 6 emeralds.\n\nThe enchantments are the same as the ones obtained from an enchantment table at levels 5\u201319.\n\n\u2191 a b All enchantments are equally probable, including treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, and Swift Sneak), and any level of the enchantment is equally probable.\n\nIf a carrot on a stick or a warped fungus on a stick is used to the point of zero durability, it becomes a fishing rod again.\n\nIn Java Edition, the drowned mob has a 3.75% chance of spawning with a fishing rod equipped.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, naturally-spawned drowned has 0.85% chance to spawn with fishing rod, while converted drowned has 1% chance to spawn with it.\n\nIf killed, they have an 8.5% chance of dropping this fishing rod.\n\nThat chance increases by 1% for each level of Looting applied to a weapon (up to 11.5% chance).\n\nThe dropped item is damaged and never enchanted.\n\nMain article: Fishing Fishing rods can be cast into water.\n\nAfter a short period of time, a stream of bubble particles approaches the fishing rod.\n\nIf the rod is reeled in once the particles \"bite\" the bobber, the player obtains a fish, junk, or possibly a treasure item.\n\nIf the fishing rod was in the player's hand and is no longer, the fishing bobber entity despawns, unless the fishing rod to the off-hand or it's been swapped with another fishing rod [citation needed ].\n\nSee also: Fishing \u00a7 Fishing rod durability The fishing rod can be used to hook mobs, items  [Java Edition only ] and some entities, and even players.\n\nThe fishing rod can then be reeled in, dragging the hooked object toward the player without dealing damage.\n\nReeling in a mob or entity costs 5 points of durability, and reeling in an item costs 3 points.\n\nReeling a mob pulls it toward the player with a speed of 1 \u2044 10 the distance between mob and player.\n\nBesides mobs and items, entities that can be reeled in include: Boat s Boat with Chest s Minecarts of any type Armor Stand s Shulker Bullet s Fireball s Small fireball s Primed TNT Any falling block such as Sand, Gravel, Dragon Egg s, Concrete Powder s, Scaffolding, Snow on Bedrock Edition or Anvil s Some entities can be hooked, but cannot be reeled in: Mobs riding/being ridden by other mobs (in Bedrock Edition, the hooked mob dismounts) Painting s Item Frame s Lead knots End Crystal s Shulker s Attempting to reel in said entities still costs durability to the rod.\n\nThe rest of the entities cannot be hooked at all: Thrown eggs Thrown snowballs Thrown ender pearls Thrown eyes of ender Thrown potions Thrown bottles o' enchanting Dragon fireballs Wither skulls Firework rockets in flight Arrows in flight Area effect cloud XP orbs Using it on a villager lowers the player's popularity and causes any naturally-spawned iron golems nearby to attack.\n\nA fishing rod can be used as fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per fishing rod.\n\nThe hook can also be used to activate wooden pressure plates or weighted pressure plates.\n\nA fishing rod can receive the following enchantments: \u2191 Lure levels above V don't work.\n\nA fishing rod with the Mending enchantment has infinite durability if used for fishing only.\n\nThe rod incrementally repairs itself using the experience gained each time a player reels in a fish, even if starting from nearly 0% durability.\n\nPlayers wearing damaged Mending armor have a lower average rate of repair, because the mending mechanic can ignore damage to the rod while repairing armor instead.\n\nUnbreaking III can nearly guarantee that the rod does not break, unless it's already at low durability.\n\nFishing Bobber

bobber may stick to it like a normal block, go through and travel in the Nether, or stop on the next block behind the portal.\n\nIf the player stands directly in front of a column and casts the line onto a block above the player, the line falls downward.\n\nIf the bobber hits a painting, the painting breaks.\n\nThe player can get into bed after casting a line, and the line remains in the water
