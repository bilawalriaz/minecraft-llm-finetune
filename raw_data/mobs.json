[Java Edition only ] Mobs are listed and classified by their nature from the player's perspective.\n\nFor more details on a particular mob, click on them to view their individual page.\n\nPassive mobs are harmless mobs (except for the pufferfish) that do not attempt to attack the player, even when provoked or attacked.\n\nMost of them can be bred or tamed.\n\nAllay Armadillo Axolotl Bat Camel Cat Chicken Cod Cow Donkey Frog Glow Squid Horse Mooshroom Mule Ocelot Parrot Pig Pufferfish (defensive) Rabbit Salmon Sheep Skeleton Horse Sniffer Snow Golem Squid Strider Tadpole Tropical Fish Turtle Villager Wandering Trader Neutral mobs are sometimes passive and sometimes hostile toward the player.\n\nAll of these mobs (except goats and foxes) are provoked when the player attacks it first.\n\nSome mobs may also be naturally hostile with provocation, and some mobs also have some additional way to be provoked.\n\nBee Cave Spider Dolphin Drowned Enderman Fox Goat Iron Golem (naturally spawned) Llama Panda Piglin Polar Bear Spider Trader Llama Wolf (untamed) Zombified Piglin Hostile mobs are dangerous, aggressive mobs that always attack the player within their respective

Skeleton Slime Stray Vex Vindicator Warden Witch Wither Wither Skeleton Zoglin Zombie Zombie Villager Compound mobs, also called jockeys, are a special condition in which a mob spawns riding another mob.\n\nAll jockeys are hostile except for the strider jockey, which is neutral.\n\nChicken Jockey Hoglin Jockey Ravager Jockey Skeleton Horseman Spider Jockey Strider Jockey Boss mobs are special hostile mobs that are distinctly more dangerous and tougher than other mobs.\n\nThey do not spawn randomly, and are confronted intentionally.\n\nBoss mobs provide unique challenges but also equivalent rewards.\n\nEnder Dragon Wither See also: Java Edition unused features, Bedrock Edition unused features and Minecraft Education exclusive features Only contains a few mobs that never spawn naturally

may or may not come in a future update.\n\nIn 2016, Jeb held an informal poll on Twitter in which the public voted on adding the llama to Minecraft over the alpaca.\n\n[3] [4] In the six annual Minecraft events MINECON Earth 2017, MINECON Earth 2018, MINECON Live 2019, Minecraft Live 2020, Minecraft Live 2021, Minecraft Live 2022, and Minecraft Live 2023, the public also voted on a mob to be added to Minecraft.\n\nIn the first vote, the winner was the phantom (then known as \"Mob B\" or \"The Monster of the Night Skies\").\n\nIn the second, the winner was the taiga biome and the fox.\n\nIn the third, the winner was the mountain biome and the goat.\n\nIn the fourth, the winner was the glow squid.\n\nIn the fifth, the winner was the allay.\n\nIn the sixth, the winner was the sniffer.\n\nAnd In the seventh, the winner was the armadillo.\n\nShortly before the second vote, the China Edition also had a mob vote, the winner of which was the panda.\n\nShortly after the second vote, there was also a vote for which new cat skin would be added, the winner of which was Jellie.\n\nThe mob vote was discontinued in 2024.\n\nMost of the mobs are divided into different types, such as the animals or the monsters, but some creatures are assigned to a more detailed group.\n\nThere are a total of four mob classifications that have different effects than other mobs.\n\nSome mobs are weak or immune to certain kinds of damage.\n\nSea creatures, such as turtles, take more damage from tridents that are enchanted with Impaling. [Java Edition only ]  [until JE Combat Tests ] Skeletons and their variants are immune to drowning.\n\nAll undead mobs are healed by potions of Harming, but take extra damage from weapons enchanted with Smite, along with taking damage from Potions of Healing.\n\nMany of these weaknesses and immunities are a result of what category (see below) of mobs that the mob falls into.\n\nA dying zombie.\n\nMain article: Undead This group of mobs includes drowned, husks, phantoms, skeletons, skeleton horses, strays, withers, wither skeletons, zoglins, zombies, zombie horses, zombie villagers, and zombified piglins.\n\nThese mobs are damaged by potions of Healing, healed by potions of Harming, and are immune to drowning (except for husks and zombies, which turn into zombies and drowned if drowning, respectively) and poison damage.\n\nZombies, zombie villagers, drowned, skeletons, strays, and phantoms burn when under direct sunlight, unless they are touching water or wearing a helmet.\n\nUnder the fire resistance effect, undead mobs still catch fire in direct sunlight but do not get hurt by the fire.\n\nAll undead mobs except for drowned, phantoms, and withers sink in water.\n\nAll undead mobs take extra damage from weapons enchanted with Smite, and are ignored by withers.\n\nMost undead mobs have the ability to pick up items.\n\nSome can spawn wearing armor, or holding tools or weapons.\n\nA dolphin chasing a raw cod.\n\nMain article: Aquatic This group of mobs includes axolotls, dolphins, squids, glow squids, guardians, elder guardians, turtles, cod, salmon, pufferfish, and tropical fish, but not drowned.\n\n[5] They take extra damage from tridents enchanted with Impaling, [Java Edition only ]  [until JE Combat Tests ] and, except axolotl, do not cause pufferfish to inflate nor take damage from them.\n\nAll aquatic mobs except dolphins are immune to drowning, and all except guardians, elder guardians, and turtles take suffocation damage if out of water for too long.\n\nAquatic mobs have the ability to swim, whereas other mobs simply float on water or sink.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition there is no in-game classification for these mobs.\n\nA spider.\n\nMain article: Arthropods This group consists of mobs based on arthropods, namely bees, cave spiders, endermites, silverfish, and spiders.\n\nThey take extra damage and receive the Slowness IV effect when attacked with weapons enchanted with Bane of Arthropods.\n\nIllagers attacking villagers on a raid Main article: Illager This group includes pillagers, illusioners  [JE only ] [unused mob ], ravagers  [BE only ], evokers, and vindicators.\n\nThey are immune to evoker fangs damage and ignored by vindicators named \"Johnny\" (except ravagers [Java Edition only ]).\n\nThey are hostile toward villagers, wandering traders, iron golems and players in Survival or Adventure mode.\n\nWitches, and vexes may accompany them in raids.\n\nIllusioners (and witches [Bedrock Edition only ]) can see players or targets through blocks.\n\nSome non-boss mobs resist a percentage of knockback from attacks.\n\nThe damage mobs deal to players is affected by the difficulty of the game.\n\nThe below values represent the amount of damage taken per hit.\n\nThis applies only to mobs attacking the player.\n\nMobs attacking other mobs always deal the 'Normal' damage listed, regardless of difficulty.\n\nValues for the creeper and ghast assume the player is directly adjacent to the explosion.\n\nThe damage of slimes and magma cubes depends on their size.\n\nTiny-sized slimes, while hostile, are unable to do damage directly.\n\nMobs deal no damage to players on peaceful.\n\nMain article: Mob/ED [edit ] Advancements are made when a player accomplishes something that is either rare to accomplish or sometimes easy to do so (such as Adventure for killing or getting killed by an entity).\n\nFor issues unique to specific mobs, see that mob's issues section.\n\nIssues relating to \"Mob\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nRenaming a mob \"Dinnerbone\" or \"Grumm\" using a spawn egg or name tag causes it to flip upside down.\n\nRenaming a sheep \"jeb_\" makes its wool change color with a smooth transition between colors.\n\nNote that the sheep named \"jeb_\" drops only the color of wool it had when named (e.g., when a pink sheep is named \"jeb_\" and then sheared when its color has changed to blue, it still drops pink wool).\n\nRenaming a vindicator \"Johnny\" makes it attack all nearby mobs, except other illagers.\n\nRenaming a rabbit \"Toast\" gives the rabbit a new texture, as an Easter egg to xyzen420's girlfriend's missing rabbit.\n\n[8] Spiders, cave spiders, slimes, silverfish and illusioners are some of the few mobs that can see players behind walls.\n\nCats, villagers and bats can see players with the invisibility effect.\n\nThere are many blocks in the game that do not take up a full block, such as trapdoors, and mobs actually see many of these as full blocks.\n\nWith some blocks, mobs mistake them for air, such as carpets, snow, and string.\n\nStrangely, despite the term mob being derived from mobile entity, supplementary material consistently uses it within the Minecraft universe.\n\nCharacters from Minecraft Story Mode begin calling monsters mobs starting in Order Up, whereas Farnum refers to himself as a \u201cmobologist.\u201d Official T-shirt artwork \"Animal Totem\" made by JINX.\n\nOfficial T-shirt artwork \"Creatures\" made by JINX.\n\nOfficial T-shirt artwork \"Lineup\" featuring

there is a 1% chance for it to increase by 2.\n\nWhen the amount reaches 5, honey can be seen dripping from the bottom and front of the hive/nest.\n\nA hive/nest must have 5 honey inside before a player can collect honeycombs or honey bottles.\n\nA bee coming out of a bee nest.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Honey farming Bees live together in colonies and take any bee nest or beehive that has enough space as their home.\n\nOne bee nest or beehive can house up to 3 bees.\n\nHomeless bees wander around, searching for empty beehives.\n\nBees can enter a beehive from any side, but exit only from the front.\n\nOne-way bee-gates can be made in this way.\n\nBees return to their nest when it rains or when it is night.\n\nThey return even when in biomes that don't rain like desert.\n\nThey stay in their nest or hive for at least 2400 game ticks (2 minutes) before coming back out.\n\nThe bees that come out keep their data (health, name, etc.).\n\nBreaking a nest or hive that contains bees releases all the bees.\n\nIf a bee nest containing bees is harvested using a tool enchanted with Silk Touch, the bees inside are kept, with their corresponding data, in the hive.\n\nThey can exit the hive again when it is placed.\n\nWhen a bee that has pollen enters and then leaves its nest or hive, the honey level of the nest or hive is increased by one.\n\nWhen the honey level of that hive reaches 5, the player can harvest it, which then sets it back to 0.\n\nBecause there is neither daylight cycle nor weather in the Nether and the End, bees work without resting in these dimensions.\n\nThis behavior is distinct from that of the villagers, which follow their daily routine according to the time in the Overworld, regardless of which dimension they are in.\n\nMain article: Damage All bees nearby are angered when an individual bee is attacked (unless the bee attacked is killed in one hit [Java Edition only ]), honey or honeycombs are collected (unless a campfire is placed under the nest), or a beehive is destroyed.\n\nHitting or walking on a nest does not anger bees; it must be destroyed to anger them.\n\nWhen destroyed, a beehive releases any bees that it contained, and the bees will be angry.\n\nIf the beehive is destroyed with a Silk Touch tool, bees outside the hive become angry  [Bedrock Edition only ], [8] while those kept within it remain neutral even after the hive is placed again.\n\nThe Invisibility effect does not cause stingers in stung players to disappear.\n\nBees attack and swarm the player as a group when angered, and the eyes of angered bees turn blood red.\n\nCollecting a honeycomb or a honey bottle from a nest or hive causes the bees that are currently in that nest or hive to leave and swarm the player unless a campfire is placed below the hive.\n\nBees attack only once, similarly to llamas and non-aggressive pandas.\n\nBees do not deal any damage in Peaceful difficulty.\n\nIf the player deflects a bee's attack with a shield, the bee continues attacking until it succeeds in hitting the player.\n\nWhen a bee's attack on a player succeeds, the player is poisoned.\n\nA bee loses its stinger after a successful attack, cannot attack further, and dies approximately one minute later.\n\nThis can be delayed with potions (Regeneration / Resistance / Absorption) that have a 255 potency.\n\nIt is possible to (quickly) breed at least one angered bee with another, even if it or they had stung and lost the stinger.\n\nHowever, they remain angered and still die later due to having lost their stingers.\n\nBees also swarm and attack other mobs when damaged; for example, if a skeleton accidentally shoots a bee.\n\nBees become neutral if they fail to land a hit on their target within 25 seconds.\n\nThe stinging animation; the bee can remain upside down for longer periods of time if a distance is kept.\n\nPrior to stinging After stinging In Java Edition, a bee's stinger is visible on the player as a small black dot after the bee successfully attacked.\n\nMain article: Honey Block Bees attach themselves to honey blocks, as if they are \"eating\" the block.\n\nMain article: Breeding Bees follow players holding flowers, flowering azalea, cherry leaves, flowering azalea leaves and mangrove propagule.\n\nIf the player is standing still and being followed by bees, the bees go toward the player, face the player, and rest on the ground.\n\nThey do this until the player moves.\n\nIf bees are given a flower, they enter love mode and pair up to create baby bees, granting the player 1-7 experience.\n\nThe parent bees have a cooldown of 5 minutes (6000 ticks) before they can breed again.\n\nBabies take 20 minutes (1 in-game day) to grow up.\n\nThe growth of baby bees can be accelerated using flowers; each use reduces the remaining time by 10%.\n\nHowever, bees' growth timer and breeding cooldowns are frozen while working in a hive; thus, when rapidly growing a population, it may be desirable to temporarily remove the hives.\n\nAny of the 1- or 2-block flowers can be used for breeding, including the wither rose, [9] even though it usually harms bees that touch it.\n\nJava Edition: Bees use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 loop1 and 2 are multiplied by 0.6;

mob found in desert villages that can be saddled and ridden by up to two players at once.\n\nA camel is tall enough that its riders cannot be reached from the ground by a few melee-attacking harmful mobs, who do not attack the camel.\n\nA camel spawns in the center of each desert village during world generation.\n\nThey do not respawn if they are killed.\n\n1\u20133 experience orbs drop when camels are killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nA saddle is dropped if the camel was already equipped with one.\n\nUpon successful breeding, 1\u20137 is dropped.\n\nKilling a baby camel yields neither items nor experience.\n\nA camel wanders aimlessly, avoiding hazards and obstacles or it sits for two to seven seconds, before eventually getting up.\n\nCamels immediately get up and flee after being harmed.\n\nA seated camel cannot be pushed by players or mobs.\n\n[1] Sitting camels do not stand up if there are solid blocks above them, as doing so would cause them to take suffocation damage immediately after.\n\nCamels are healed by 2 health points each time they are fed a cactus.\n\nCamels also heal on their own over time slowly.\n\nDespite the fact they are bred with cacti, touching a cactus block still harms camels like any other mob.\n\nA camel sitting in a desert village.\n\nCamels have the unique ability to step up 1.5 block-high walls, unlike other mounts such as horses, which can automatically step up one block without jumping.\n\nThis allows camels to step onto fences and walls, among other things.\n\nMain article: Riding Camels can be ridden by players.\n\nUp to two players can ride one camel.\n\nWhile riding, the player in the back seat cannot hurt the player driving or the camel itself.\n\nCamels have one slot in their inventory, to put a Saddle on it.\n\nA saddle can be placed on a camel by holding it and then using it on the camel, or by accessing its inventory.\n\nA camel's inventory can be accessed by mounting the camel and using inventory control, or by sneaking and then using or pressing the \"open inventory\" button [Bedrock Edition only ] on the camel.\n\nOnce a camel is saddled, the player can control it with standard directional controls, jump, and the mouse.\n\nThe player dismounts using the dismount control.\n\nLike riding other entities, it is impossible for a player to use a nether portal or end portal while on a camel.\n\nCamels cannot float on water when being controlled by a player.\n\nThey can be ridden in water up to 3 blocks deep.\n\nIn deeper water, the player is automatically dismounted.\n\n[2] Several husks trying to attack Efe.\n\nCamels walk slowly and can sprint.\n\nSaddled camels also have the ability of \"dashing charging\".\n\nWhen the player rides them, the experience bar on HUD is replaced by a dash charging bar.\n\nDashing is done using the jump control, and holding the control charges for a longer dashing.\n\nCamels can dash every 2.75 seconds.\n\nWhen dashing, the camel launches up to 12 blocks forward and one block upward.\n\nFor a short time after dashing, the camel cannot sprint.\n\nCamels are tall enough that most melee hostile mobs such as zombies, vindicators, hoglins, silverfish, endermites and golden sword -wielding piglins cannot reach players to attack them.\n\nSpiders, wolves, slimes and magma cubes can attack because they jump or climb while attacking.\n\nMost mobs never deliberately attack camels under any circumstance, even to reach players riding one; the only exceptions are mobs that attack all other mobs, these being zoglins and vindicators named \"Johnny\".\n\nMain article: Breeding A camel follows the player who holds a cactus but stops following the player if it is separated from the player by at least 10 blocks [Java Edition only ] / 16 blocks [Bedrock Edition only ].\n\nSitting camels do not follow the player.\n\nAdult camels enter love mode and breed to create baby camels after they are each given a cactus.\n\nThe parents have a cooldown of five minutes before they can breed again.\n\nThe growth time that baby camels take to be an adult camel can be reduced by giving the baby camel cactus.\n\nJava Edition: Camels use the

One untamed black cat generates alongside a witch inside swamp huts upon world generation.\n\nThis cat never despawns.\n\nAdditional cats can spawn within the hut similarly to witches; for this to happen, there must be grass blocks present inside the bounding box of the swamp hut.\n\nIn Java Edition, any other cats to spawn within the swamp hut (from spawn eggs and commands without cat type set) always spawn as black.\n\nA new cat does not spawn in a hut if there is already a cat within a 16\u00d78\u00d716 block volume. [Java Edition only ] [verify ] 25% of cats spawn as kittens.\n\nDuring a full moon, 50% of cats that spawn are black.\n\nAdult cats drop: 0\u20132 string.\n\nThis drop is not affected by Looting.\n\n[1] 1\u20133 when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nUpon successful breeding, 1\u20137 is dropped.\n\nLike other baby animals, killing a kitten yields no item or experience.\n\nThis page would benefit from the addition of more images.\n\nPlease remove this notice once you've added suitable images to the article.\n\nThe specific instructions are: Baby Siamese during 21w11a.\n\n11 cat variants (from left to right): Tabby, Black, White, Persian, Ragdoll, Calico, Siamese, Red, Tuxedo, Jellie and British shorthair.\n\nThe unused tamed gray tabby texture in Bedrock Edition.\n\n[2] Baby version.\n\nDespite sharing the same model, cats are smaller than ocelots.\n\nThere are currently 11 skins that cats can have.\n\nOne of the cat skins was designed after Jellie, the late cat of YouTuber GoodTimesWithScar, and was chosen by the community in a Twitter vote.\n\n[3] The current skins are: Black (black with orange eyes) British Shorthair (silver with yellow eyes) Calico (orange, white and dark brown with yellow and blue eyes) Jellie (gray and white with gray-green eyes) Persian (creamy with blue eyes and flat faces) Ragdoll (white and soft amber with blue eyes) Red (orange and white with green eyes) Siamese (white and pale brown with blue eyes) Tabby (brown and white with yellow eyes) Tuxedo (black and white with green eyes) White (white with light blue and yellow eyes) In the default resource pack, a texture file for a tamed gray tabby exists. [BE only ] [2] It is however completely unused and cannot be spawned in-game.\n\nLike tamed wolves, tamed cats also have a collar on their necks.\n\nThe color of the cat's collar is red when tamed and can be changed by using dyes.\n\nCats are immune to fall damage, but they still avoid falling off cliffs high enough to normally cause fall damage.\n\nCats can see players even if they have the Invisibility status effect.\n\nWith the exception of a faster movement rate, kittens have the same behavior as adults.\n\nThey hiss at phantoms that are currently pursuing a player. [JE only ] Creepers and phantoms avoid cats, even while pursuing a player, keeping a distance of 6 and 16 blocks away respectively from any cats.\n\nHowever, a creeper that has begun its detonation does not flee unless the player leaves its blast radius.\n\nA stray cat is an untamed cat.\n\nNaturally spawned cats always spawn as stray cats.\n\nUnlike untamed wolves, stray cats may despawn naturally.\n\nThey pursue and attack rabbits and baby turtles up to a distance of 15 blocks.\n\nEven though they spawn in villages, they don't necessarily remain there; instead, they explore.\n\nThey sprint away from any player within 7 blocks (unless the player is sneaking [BE only ] or difficulty is set to peaceful [JE only ]), and avoid players within 16 blocks.\n\nHowever, they slowly approach a player holding raw cod or salmon within 10 blocks, allowing the player to feed and tame it (see \u00a7 Taming below).\n\nIf the player turns too quickly or stops holding the fish within 6 blocks, the cat flees and does not attempt to approach the player for a few seconds.\n\nStray cats can be leashed.\n\nCats sitting on a lime bed.\n\nUnless commanded to sit (see Taming below), tamed cats do not remain still for long and explore around the player.\n\nA cat not already sitting attempts to get on top of chests, the foot part of beds, or active furnaces at the cat's current Y-level within a 4-block-radius square horizontally, and once on top often assumes a sitting position without a command from the player.\n\nA cat also occasionally attempts to sit on these blocks if the blocks are at ground level.\n\nA chest with a cat sitting on top of it becomes unusable unless the cat is commanded to stand.\n\nCats that sit on their own can be ordered to stand, or they may get up if the player holds a raw fish nearby.\n\nThe cat can also be brought down by removing the block or pushing it off.\n\nA cat can also be forcibly moved by attacking it.\n\nA cat does not sit on a block that is obstructed by another block above it.\n\nLike other mobs, cats enter nearby boats, trapping themselves.\n\nIf a player is harmed by a hostile mob or a harming potion, but not by environmental damage, a cat sitting in proximity to the player stands, moves a few blocks from its sitting location and then resumes sitting.\n\nWhen the player sleeps, tamed cats move toward their owner and sleep near them.\n\nWhen the player wakes, their tamed cats also wake.\n\nThere is a 70% chance for a tamed cat to give the player a gift after they wake up, but only if the player sleeps at night (if the player sleeps during a thunderstorm during the daytime, or if the tamed cat has been ordered to sit, the player receives no gift).\n\nThe gift is a dropped item from the cat_morning_gift.json loot table: After a cat gives a gift, both the cat and the gift are located in the general area of the bed the player slept on, including on the other side of walls or floors.\n\nIf a player has multiple standing tamed cats in the area, only the tamed cat that sleeps on the player may provide a gift.\n\nIf all standing tamed cats in the area are prevented from reaching the player (i.e.\n\ntrapped in minecarts or boats), then in Java Edition each cat has a 70% chance of providing a gift while in Bedrock Edition only one cat may give a gift.\n\nTamed cats teleport to the player if they are more than 12 blocks from the player, except where listed below.\n\nIt is possible for a tamed cat to teleport to an inaccessible location (e.g.\n\nunder ice) and be injured or suffocate of various causes as a result.\n\nA cat does not teleport: If the cat has been ordered to sit.\n\nException: The cat is likely to teleport if it is injured while sitting (it does not sit after it teleports).\n\nA dramatic example is if a cat sitting outside is struck by lightning, in which case the cat materializes on fire.\n\nThis kills the cat.\n\nException: If a kitten is told to sit, and grows up while the chunk it is sitting in is still loaded, it teleports to the player and materializes still sitting.\n\nIf the cat is attempting to sit on a chest, bed, or furnace.\n\n [Bedrock Edition only ] If the cat is attempting to lay or is laying on a bed.\n\nIf the cat is in a minecart or boat.\n\nIf the cat has been attached to a fence post with a lead.\n\nIf the cat is in an unloaded chunk.\n\nIf none of the blocks on the edge of a 5\u00d75\u00d71 region centered on the player are transparent blocks with an opaque block below and another transparent block above.\n\nIf the player is in another dimension.\n\nIf the player is in water: The cat teleports to the player when the player leaves the water.\n\nIf the cat is in water: teleportation is unreliable.\n\nIt may or may not occur.\n\nCat teleportation is completely silent.\n\n[4] A sitting tamed black cat.\n\nStray cats can be tamed using raw cod or raw salmon (see #Behavior for how to approach a cat).\n\nOnce tamed, cats follow the player who tamed them.\n\nThey do not despawn, no longer fear the player and purr or meow frequently.\n\nLike wolves, and with the same limits, they can teleport to a player who moves 12 blocks away.\n\nThe player can order a cat to sit/stand by pressing use on it.\n\nIf the player is holding a raw cod or salmon when commanding a cat to sit or stand, the fish is given to the cat instead, causing it to enter love mode.\n\nOnce in love mode, the player can command a cat to sit or stand while holding a fish.\n\nCats also sit on certain things of their own accord (see #Tamed cat).\n\nMain article: Breeding Two cats with a newly bred kitten.\n\nWhen tamed cats are fed a raw cod or salmon, they enter love mode.\n\nBreeding creates a kitten, and the parents cannot breed again for 5 minutes.\n\nThe kitten has the coloring of and belongs to the owner of one of the parents.\n\nTwo sitting cats are unable to breed, but a mobile cat can breed with a sitting cat, in which case the mobile cat's owner also owns the kitten.\n\nThe 20 minute growth of kittens can be reduced using raw cod or salmon.\n\nEach fish reduces the growth time remaining by 10%.\n\nFeeding an injured tamed cat an uncooked cod or salmon restores its health by 2.\n\nUnlike tamed wolves, a tamed cat's tail is not an indicator of its health.\n\nJava Edition: Cats use the Friendly Creatures sound category

2014.\n\n[11] The Jellie cat was based on GoodTimesWithScar's pet cat, Jellie, who passed away on January 4th, 2024.\n\n[12] In MINECON Earth 2018, Jeb announced that the community could vote for a 9th cat skin to be added with the rest of the other 8 cat skins.\n\nAs a result, YouTuber GoodTimesWithScar\u2019s cat Jellie won the contest and was added in Village and Pillage, making the second mob variation that was suggested by the community, the first being \"Toast\", a rabbit skin added as a tribute to a user's deceased pet rabbit.\n\nBoth calico and white cats appear to have heterochromia, which is an uncommon feature in cats making both their eyes different colours.\n\nThe calico cat skin's fur pattern resembles that of Winslow, from Minecraft: Story Mode, with the only differences being the eye color and the mirrored fur pattern.\n\nThe episode in which the cat appears was released two years before calico cats were added to the game.\n\nIn real life, cats have been known for their ability to flip upright during a fall, particularly larger ones; though they still might be injured by landing.\n\nThis fact is reflected in Minecraft because they aren't damaged by falls.\n\nThe current Siamese cat texture is unused in Bedrock Edition.\n\nIn real life, calico cats are almost always female and the few male calicos that do occur are generally sterile.\n\nHowever, since animals in Minecraft are genderless, it isn't odd to breed two calico cats with each other.\n\nPersian cats in-game is the only cat variant that don't have snouts, based on their real-life variant.\n\nThe white cat in-game could be percieved as being a Khao Manee breed, due to their fur is all-white, and all white cats have heterochromia, as with most Khao Manee cats do.\n\nTabby Cat

can be attached to a lead.\n\nChickens spawn naturally in the Overworld in groups of four above grass blocks with two blocks of free space above it at a light level of nine or more.\n\nChickens do not spawn in deserts, snowy plains, ice spikes, snowy slopes, meadows, wooded badlands, jagged peaks, frozen peaks and stony peaks.\n\nIn Java Edition, chickens are more common in sparse jungles.\n\nChickens spawn individually after the world generation and 5% of chickens spawn as baby chickens.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, chickens require a light level of 7 or more to spawn and spawn in groups of two to four during the world generation.\n\nMain article: Chicken Jockey All baby zombie variants and baby zombified piglins have a 5% chance to spawn riding a chicken, forming a chicken jockey.\n\nBecause a baby zombie occurs from 5% of zombie spawns, the chicken jockey spawns consist of 0.25% of all zombie spawns in a chicken-free environment; if chickens are present, the chance increases to 0.4875%.\n\nA chicken jockey can also be spawned by using the following command: / summon minecraft:chicken ~ ~ ~ {IsChickenJockey:1b,Passengers:[{id:\"minecraft:zombie\",IsBaby:1b}]} Chicken jockeys may spawn with items equipped.\n\nBaby zombified piglin versions of the chicken jockey always wield a golden sword.\n\nHarming or killing the chicken does not cause the zombified piglin to attack.\n\nChickens spawn in the Nether in this way.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, baby zombie jockeys do not spawn riding chickens, but check for nearby adult chickens to mount prior to attacking the player, a wandering trader, an adult villager, a snow golem or an iron golem.\n\nMain article: Tutorials/Chicken farming Adult chickens that were not part of chicken jockeys lay an egg every five to ten minutes.\n\nWhen an adult chicken is killed, it drops from zero to two feathers.\n\nThe maximum is increased by one per level of Looting, for a maximum of zero to five with Looting III.\n\nThe

cubic area, while a baby chicken follows adult chickens.\n\nChickens uniquely attempt to jump up to climb stairs instead of climbing them normally.\n\n[1] Chickens avoid falling off cliffs and flap their wings when they are in mid air and fall slowly, thus they are immune to fall damage.\n\nWhen harmed, chickens flee around for a two seconds.\n\nOcelots and foxes pursue and attack chickens.\n\nWhile in a loaded chunk, an adult chicken lays an egg every five to ten minutes (from 6000 to 12000 in-game ticks), unless it is or was, a part of a chicken jockey.\n\nIf the player is close enough to a chicken when it lays an egg, an indicative sound is heard.\n\nChickens stay underwater for 15 seconds or can swim, visibly flapping their wings and staying on the water

chickens if all spawn chances succeed for all eggs.\n\nIf the player throws an egg at a glass pane, the baby chicken can spawn on the far side of the pane.\n\nAs chickens can produce each other with eggs, they're perhaps the only passive mob you can farm with just a single individual, if you're willing to wait patiently and constantly throw eggs.\n\nJava Edition: Chickens use the Friendly

when tamed, can be ridden and equipped with chests.\n\n1-3 donkeys spawn in plains and only 1 in savannas.\n\nDonkeys also spawn in meadows.\n\n20% of the individual donkeys spawn as foals.\n\n2-6 donkeys spawn only in plains at light level 7 or above.\n\n[1] Adult donkeys are 1.4 blocks wide and long, and 1.6 blocks high.\n\nFoals start at half the size of adults and in Bedrock Edition, get progressively bigger as they age.\n\nUnlike wolves and cats, the appearances of donkeys do not change once they have been tamed, though tamed donkeys may be differentiated by giving them equipment.\n\nDonkeys are smaller all around than the normal horses and sport long, erect ears.\n\nTheir manes do not protrude, but rather are drawn directly on the back of their heads and necks.\n\nAll donkeys have gray-brown coats with darker ankles, ears, manes, and tails.\n\nDonkeys can be equipped with a simple saddle, not the full covered armor and they can also be equipped with chests to store up to 15 stacks of items.\n\nUnlike almost all other mobs, donkeys with equipped saddles or chests do not render these when under the effect of Invisibility.\n\n[2] Upon death, donkeys drop: 0\u20132 Leather.\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-5 with Looting III.\n\n1\u20133, when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nIf equipped with a chest or saddle, they drop those items.\n\nThey also drop the contents of the chest.\n\nUpon successful breeding, 1\u20137 is dropped.\n\nKilling a baby donkey yields no items nor experience.\n\nSee also: Transportation Tamed and saddled donkeys are some of the fastest means of transportation or hauling in the game, although they are unable to fit through single block-wide openings.\n\nThey can also be used to climb hills and jump fences, which the player can't generally.\n\nDonkeys cannot float on water when being controlled by a player.\n\nThey can be ridden in water up to 2 blocks deep.\n\nIn deeper water, the player is automatically dismounted.\n\n[3] Donkeys can be equipped with chests and used as pack animals.\n\nThey can also be pulled along and tied up using a lead.\n\nGUI of a donkey, when equipped with a chest.\n\nTamed donkeys can have the following slot available: Saddle Slot: For equipping a saddle.\n\nAn additional 15 inventory slots, provided the donkey has been equipped with a chest.\n\nEquipment can be placed on a donkey by holding left shift and then using on the donkey, or by accessing its inventory.\n\nA donkey\u2019s inventory can be accessed by mounting the donkey and using inventory control, or by sneaking and then using or pressing the \"open inventory\" button [Bedrock Edition only ] on the donkey.\n\nA donkey can be equipped with a chest by using a chest on a donkey.\n\nThe chest cannot be removed except by killing the donkey, which causes the chest and its contents to drop.\n\nFoals cannot be equipped with anything.\n\nMain article: Riding Once a donkey is tamed and saddled, the player can control it with the standard directional controls, jump, and the mouse.\n\nThe player dismounts using the dismount control.\n\nLike riding other entities, it is impossible for a player to use a nether portal or end portal while on a donkey.\n\nA ridden saddled donkey automatically runs up any one block high slope.\n\nThe donkey and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high.\n\nLower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block.\n\nThe donkey itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks.\n\nThey cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.\n\nUnlike horses, all spawned donkeys have the same movement speed and jump strength, although speed potions can be used on the donkey and travel via the Nether can make the donkey easily the pack animal with the fastest practical way to travel in Minecraft.\n\nDonkeys are slow-moving backward, and about as fast as the player when moving sideways.\n\nRidden saddled donkeys have the ability of \"jumping charging\".\n\nWhen the player rides them, the experience bar on HUD is replaced by jumping charging bar.\n\nA ridden saddled donkey can be made to jump and holding the control charges for a higher leap.\n\nDonkeys are not affected by jump boost beacons or potions.\n\nDonkeys roam around idly, occasionally stopping to rear, swish their tails, or lower their heads as though eating the grass.\n\nUnlike sheep, the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed.\n\nA donkey may turn to look at a player who comes near.\n\nAny donkey, even a wild one, allows itself to be attached to a lead without protest.\n\nHowever, if the player attempts to saddle an untamed donkey, it rears and flails its front hooves.\n\nDonkeys remain passive, even when hit.\n\nDonkeys occasionally emit an audible braying sound.\n\nAdult Donkeys, unlike most mobs, cannot ride in a minecart and boat.\n\nFoals, however, can.\n\nUnlike other passive mobs, donkeys slowly regenerate health.\n\nAdult donkeys can be tamed.\n\nWith an empty hand, mount it repeatedly; when it shows hearts and no longer bucks the player, it is tamed.\n\nIt is necessary to tame a donkey in order to breed it, give it equipment, or ride it for any length of time.\n\nTaming depends on the donkey's \"temper\".\n\nThey begin with a temper of 0 out of 100.\n\nWhen a player is riding the donkey, a random number between 0 and 99 is chosen.\n\nThe donkey becomes tame if this number is less than the temper, otherwise, the temper is increased by 5 and the player is bucked off.\n\nTemper can also be increased by feeding the donkey.\n\nWhile riding an untamed donkey, a galloping sound is audible, more or less rapid.\n\nThis gives a general idea of the donkey's speed.\n\nIt is unknown whether there is any indication of jump height before taming.\n\nLike all tamed animals, a death message is displayed to their owner if they are killed. [Bedrock Edition only ] Feeding tamed donkeys golden apples or golden carrots activates love mode.\n\nThe offspring appear more spindly than their adult versions and grow progressively larger with time until they reach their full size.\n\nThe offspring do not automatically belong to the player who owns their parents.\n\nRather, it is born as an untamed donkey and must be tamed after it grows into an adult.\n\nThe foal can be fed to make it mature faster.\n\nBreeding two donkeys creates a donkey foal.\n\nBecause all donkeys have the same texture, the offspring looks exactly like its parents when it is fully grown.\n\nCross-breeding a donkey with a horse creates a mule foal.\n\nMules cannot breed.\n\nFeeding a donkey food may alter its behavior and cause it to grow (if it is not yet an adult; foals normally take 20 minutes to fully mature if not fed), and restore its health.\n\nTo feed a donkey, hold a valid food item and press use while looking at it.\n\nIf the food is invalid, the action is treated as an attempt to mount the donkey.\n\nDonkeys can be fed only when feeding would have an effect, similar to other animals.\n\nThe table below lists the effects of the various foods donkeys can consume.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Horses All donkeys have three \"equine stats\" that vary between donkeys: health, (maximum) movement speed, and jump strength.\n\nThese stats are created once the donkey is born or spawned, and are not affected by food.\n\nWhen spawned in any way except breeding \u2013 for instance, using commands, spawning naturally, spawning as part of a skeleton trap, or using spawn eggs \u2013 donkeys are assigned their stats within certain ranges, specific according to their horse type.\n\nDonkey's health ranges from 15\u201330, but tends toward the average 22\u201323.\n\nDisplayed hearts are health, divided by two, rounded down.\n\nA donkey with an odd number of health points (15, 17, 19, etc.) does not display the last half-heart.\n\nIf the donkey has lost one fewer health point than the inflicted damage and did not regenerate, it has an odd number of health points, otherwise, it has an even number of health points.\n\nA spawned donkey's speed value is always 0.175, but it only moves at the slightly reduced 7.38 blocks/sec.\n\nFor reference, the player's normal walking speed is 0.1, equivalent to 4.3 blocks/sec.\n\nand the player's sprinting speed is equivalent to 5.6 blocks/sec.\n\nThe speed listed does not include any status effect that affects the speed of a horse or a player.\n\nA bred donkey's speed value has the same limits as other horses, between 0.1125 and 0.3375.\n\nSee Horse#Movement speed.\n\nSee transportation to compare the speeds of various transportation methods.\n\nA spawned donkey's jump strength is always 0.5, enough to clear 1 9 \u2044 16 blocks.\n\nA bred donkey's jump strength has the same limits as other horses, between 0.4 and 1.0.\n\nSee Tutorials/Horses#Speed.\n\nWhen breeding two donkeys, the foal's stats are determined by a variation of the average of both parents' stats, randomly determined the same way horses' stats are.\n\nJava Edition: Donkeys use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b c MC-98316 \u2014 Wrong subtitles caused by missing distinction Bedrock Edition: \u2191 a b These sound events are assigned to the donkey, but are not called by the game \u2191 Except for stems, Nether wood, cherry wood, and bamboo wood due to MCPE-165012 Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Donkeys have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Additional fields for mobs that can breed Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Tags common to all horses ChestedHorse: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the horse has chests.\n\nA chested horse that is not a donkey or a mule crashes the game.\n\nItems: List of items.\n\nOnly exists if ChestedHorse is true.\n\nAn item, including the Slot tag.\n\nSlots are numbered 2 to 16 for donkeys and mules, and none exist for all other horses.\n\nTags common to all items Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Donkey\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nIf a player picks up leather dropped by an adult donkey, they receive the \" Cow Tipper \" achievement.\n\nThis is due to the achievement being given when a player picks up any piece of leather instead of being given when killing a cow.\n\nA player riding a donkey is dragged along if the donkey is being pulled by a lead, and can even be lifted up in the air in the same way.\n\nUsing commands, it is possible to make a donkey with no armor slot, but also no way to equip a chest.\n\nIn the Bedrock Edition, the donkey can be transported in a boat by riding the donkey and jumping into the boat then dismounting (leaving the donkey behind in the boat) and activating the boat from underneath/underwater.\n\nAttempting to activate the boat to pilot it from above results in the player being mounted on the donkey again rather than being placed inside the boat to pilot it.\n\nThe first image of the donkey chest inventory.\n\n[5] A donkey and a mule.\n\nA herd of donkeys and horses spawned next to each other.\n\nLEGO Minecraft Donkey.\n\nHorse Zombie Horse Skeleton Horse Mule Llama \u2191 MCPE-118688 \u2191 MC-13738 \u2191 MC-72440 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 \" Also big thanks to @DrZhark, the creator of Mo' Creatures, that have assisted us to make it happen!\" \u2013 @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X, April 4, 2013 \u2191 \" Do not look at this image.\" \u2013 @Dinnerbone (Nathan Adams) on X, May 10, 2013 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

    "content": "\"Dragon\" redirects here.\n\nFor the mentioned feature, see Red Dragon.\n\nFor the rendering engine, see RenderDragon.\n\nFor other uses, see Dragon (disambiguation).\n\nEnder Dragon Health 200 \u00d7 100 Classification Animal Behavior Hostile Spawn The End Damage Melee: Peaceful: 0 (but still performs attack animation) Easy: 6 Normal: 10 Hard: 15 \u00d7 7.5 Wings: Easy: 3 Normal: 5 Hard: 7 Dragon's Breath: 3 per second Dragon Fireball: 6 per second Details Size Height: 8 Blocks Width: 16 Blocks Length: 16 Blocks The ender dragon is a giant flying hostile boss mob found when first entering the End.\n\nShe is the largest naturally spawning mob in the game.\n\nShe guards access to the end gateways that provide entry to the outer end islands in addition to the exit portal that allows return to the Overworld as well as access to the end credits of Minecraft.\n\nBecause of this, she is known by most Minecraft fans as the 'final boss' of the game.\n\nHer attacks involve charging at the player and her unique dragon acid attacks.\n\nThe ender dragon spawns 20 game ticks (1 second) after an entity first arrives in the End, along with the bedrock frame for the exit portal.\n\nThis image shows how the player can arrange end crystals to respawn the ender dragon.\n\nPlayers can re-summon the dragon by placing four end crystals on the edges of the exit portal, one on each side.\n\nWhen it is re-summoned, the four end crystals point to the tops of each pillar setting off a series of explosions that resets the obsidian pillars, iron bars, and end crystals.\n\nThe top of each pillar explodes, destroying any player-placed blocks.\n\nEventually, all of the end crystals point at the coordinates of (0.0, 128, 0.0) and the ender dragon spawns there.\n\nThe four crystals placed around the exit portal then explode.\n\nIf the player does not pick up the dragon egg and starts to re-summon the dragon, the dragon egg disappears.\n\nIf the dragon goes through an end gateway, another immediately spawns at (0, 128, 0) while the other dragon flies to (0, 128, 0).\n\nAfter the ender dragon is slain for the first time, the following events take place: She slowly ascends, her wings and body becoming more tattered until she disappears in beams of light erupting from her center.\n\nThere's an explosion of 12000 experience points (ten drops of 960 and one drop of 2400) \u2014 enough to bring a player from level 0 to level 68.\n\nIf killed on top of the bedrock structure, some of the experience orbs can drop into the exit portal.\n\nThe experience orbs can then be retrieved in the overworld.\n\nThe bedrock structure fills in with an end portal interface to become the exit portal, enabling the player to transport back to the Overworld and respawn at their spawn point.\n\nA dragon egg appears above the island's central bedrock structure.\n\nIf a block exists right above the center of the central bedrock structure, then the dragon egg spawns 1 block above the highest block at (0,0).\n\nIf the highest block is at the height limit, then the dragon egg does not spawn.\n\nAn end gateway portal is generated floating within 75\u2013100 blocks of the exit portal.\n\nWhen a re-summoned ender dragon is slain, the same events occur except that only 500 experience points are dropped [Java Edition only ] and no more than 20 gateway portals are generated.\n\nThe dragon egg appears the first time the ender dragon is slain in Java Edition, and the first and second time in Bedrock Edition; it does not appear after any subsequent dragon slaying.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Defeating the ender dragon During the battle with the ender dragon, unique music called \" Boss \" plays, the edges of the screen darkens and black fog appears, and chunks around the exit portal are constantly loaded regardless of render distance.\n\nThese happen as long as there is at least one player within a Euclidean distance of 192 blocks from (0.0, 128, 0.0).\n\nThe ender dragon has a light purple health bar that appears at the top of the player 's screen.\n\nHer health is frequently restored by nearby end crystals, indicated by a magical white beam connecting the dragon and the crystal.\n\nDestroying an end crystal that is actively healing the dragon causes 10 damage to her.\n\nThe dragon can take damage only from explosions and player-based damage, and takes damage of (1 \u2044 4 \u00d7 normal damage + 1) when hit on any part that is not her head, making it the most resilient mob in the game.\n\nSuffocation is completely non-applicable, as she either phases through or immediately destroys any block she touches.\n\nThe dragon is immune to all status effects.\n\nThe green hitboxes of the ender Dragon.\n\nBy using the F3 + B shortcut, the dragon's bounding box appears. [Java Edition only ] She cannot be damaged at just any spot in this large volume: eight green sub- hitboxes are also shown, which indicate the locations where the dragon can take damage: The tail, body, head, and wings.\n\nThe ender dragon is a flying mob, which cannot actually stand on the ground.\n\nShe flies around the end main island while fighting the player.\n\nThe dragon can pass through all blocks, destroying almost all types, but can still be affected by flowing water, lava and bubble column.\n\nBlocks not destroyed are those that naturally generate on the central End island and those that are intended to be indestructible, such as end stone and respawn anchors: Barrier Bedrock Command Block Crying Obsidian End stone End portal (block) End portal frame End gateway (block) Fire Iron bars Light Block Obsidian Reinforced Deepslate Respawn Anchor Structure Block In Java Edition, these blocks are marked under the dragon_immune tag, with the exception of light blocks and fire, which are marked as dragon_transparent.\n\nDestroyed blocks are not dropped, although containers (such as chests and dispensers, but not shulker boxes) drop their contents.\n\nThe dragon \"bathing\" endermen with its toxic breath attack.\n\nThe dragon never targets any entity but the player, although other mobs may turn hostile to the dragon when hit, and the dragon may sometimes retaliate against other mobs if it takes damage to a projectile.\n\nAny entities hit by her wings are dealt 5 damage (or 10 damage if hit by her head), and in Java Edition, are thrown into the air, sometimes to fatal heights or even off the island.\n\nNeither of these effects is applied for 1 \u2044 2 second after the dragon takes damage.\n\nThe ender dragon has four main states of behavior: Guarding The dragon begins in this state, circling the ring of obsidian pillars on either the outside if there are still end crystals or the inside if the crystals are destroyed.\n\nWith each crystal's destruction, she takes damage and there is an increased chance of the dragon switching states.\n\nTargeting Whenever the dragon finds herself less than 10 blocks or more than 150 blocks from her current target, she attempts to choose a new target.\n\nWhen damaged she targets a point just behind herself, causing her to turn away and choose a new target.\n\nStrafing Upon the destruction of an end crystal, the dragon switches to strafing.\n\nAs soon as it is within 64 blocks, she shoots a fireball at the player.\n\nThe dragon resumes circling after this state.\n\nDiving The dragon dives onto the target player's position, taken at the start of the dive.\n\nThe dragon resumes circling after this state, whether or not she actually hit the player.\n\nPerching While Guarding and the dragon has reached the end of the path, she has 1 in (3 + crystals alive) chance (~7.7% up to 33%) to go to the exit portal structure (approaching from the side opposite the player if possible) and lands on the highest block of the coordinates (x=0, z=0), up to (y=101). [Bedrock Edition only ] If there is no block in (x=0, z=0) the dragon freezes right when she switches to perching. [Bedrock Edition only ] The dragon is immune to arrows in this state; they all catch fire and bounce off.\n\nIn Java Edition she is also immune to thrown tridents in this state.\n\nDragon's Breath Unless the player is in Peaceful difficulty, after 1.25 seconds, if a player is within 20 blocks of the exit portal structure, the dragon roars and use its 3-second breath attack, damaging players similarly to a lingering potion of Harming.\n\nAn area of visible particles in the shape of a horizontal disc one block tall and 5 to 6 blocks in diameter appears where the breath attack strikes, either on the ground or floating in the air, at whatever point the breath attack struck a block.\n\nThe harming effect zone where the player takes damage is confined to a smaller area in the center this visible cloud, covering about 3 to 4 blocks.\n\nThe harming effect portion of the purple clouds emitted from the dragon's breath attack can be collected in a glass bottle to obtain dragon's breath.\n\nEach bottle of dragon's breath collected removes one block from the lingering damage zone of the breath attack.\n\nThe visible clouds remain for 3 seconds whether the dragons breath is bottled or not.\n\nBy rapidly collecting all of the harmful blocks, usually around three, even a direct hit from the breath attack can be mostly and even entirely negated before the player suffers any damage.\n\nCharge If the player is not near the portal within 5 seconds of the dragon's landing, it charges at players within 150 blocks.\n\nTake-off After four consecutive breath attacks, or if the dragon fails to locate a player within 150 blocks, she takes off from her perch.\n\nShe always takes off in Peaceful difficulty, making it difficult to land melee hits.\n\nThe dragon resumes circling after this state.\n\nEscape If cumulative damage taken while perched exceeds 50 \u00d7 25, the dragon takes off and resets the damage accumulator.\n\nThe accumulator is not reset if she does not take enough damage.\n\nThe dragon resumes circling after this state.\n\nIn Java Edition, when the dragon finally takes a fatal blow, she flies toward the exit portal structure before dying, unless she cannot find it within 150 blocks, or it is inside blocks.\n\nDragon Fireball Dragon Fireball (JE) Dragon Fireball (BE) Behavior Does not exist Details Size Height: 1 Block Width: 1 Block Dragon fireballs are special fireballs that the ender dragon fires while strafing.\n\nThey cannot be deflected unlike ghast fireballs, and they do no impact damage.\n\nInstead, they deposit purple effect clouds across the ground that damages players the same way a lingering potion of Harming does.\n\nThis means that the ender dragon's fireballs deal magic damage, which ignores any damage reduction that comes from the player's armor.\n\nHowever its damage does get reduced by armor enchanted with the Protection enchantment.\n\nThe purple effect cloud's hitbox slowly grows larger in diameter until it disappears.\n\nAs with her close-ranged breath attack, the purple clouds can be bottled to obtain the dragon's breath.\n\nUnlike lingering potions of Harming, the effect cloud does not shrink when affecting mobs.\n\nJava Edition: Ender dragons use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nDragon fireballs use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 While the pillars are preparing to be resummoned, it occurs at 0 seconds, 2.5\u20132.6 seconds, and 4.75\u20135 seconds.\n\nWhen the ender dragon is about to be summoned, it occurs 5\u20134.75 seconds before and 2\u20130 seconds before.\n\n\u2191 Does not trigger at all if the gamerule globalSoundEvents is false Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Ender dragons have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs DragonPhase: A number indicating the dragon's current state.\n\nValid values are: 0=circling, 1=strafing (preparing to shoot a fireball), 2=flying to the portal to land (part of transition to landed state), 3=landing on the portal (part of transition to landed state), 4=taking off from the portal (part of transition out of landed state), 5=landed, performing breath attack, 6=landed, looking for a player for breath attack, 7=landed, roar before beginning breath attack, 8=charging player, 9=flying to portal to die, 10=hovering with no AI (default when using the / summon command).\n\nDragon fireballs have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nEntity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all fireballs Tags common to all projectiles A dragon fireball spawned by a command (left) and the damage and the explosion it caused (right).\n\nThe / summon ender_dragon command, by default, summons a harmless ender dragon that hovers in place  [JE only ].\n\nSetting the DragonPhase tag (by issuing either the / summon ender_dragon ~ ~ ~ {DragonPhase:0} or the / data merge entity <selector> {DragonPhase:0} commands) starts the ender dragon's ordinary behavior, although the health bar does not appear because it is managed by the ender dragon fight status rather than by the dragon entity itself  [JE only ].\n\nIf spawned away from the center of the map (x=0, z=0), it flies to the center then resumes normal behavior (see #Behavior).\n\nTarget selectors for the ender dragon target a total of 9 entities per dragon, as the ender dragon actually consists of 9 entities internally [Java Edition only ].\n\nSo executing at a dragon to summon an arrow summons 9 arrows.\n\nThis section would benefit from the addition of more images.\n\nPlease remove this notice once you've added suitable images to the article.\n\nThe specific instructions are: Ender dragon

The Void does not affect ender dragons.\n\nIf low enough on health, the ender dragon emits beams of light without dying, as if cracked.\n\nName tags cannot be used on an ender dragon.\n\nThe ender dragon's hitbox, especially her wings, is unexpected larger than the ender dragon itself, causing players to be pushed away from her from farther away than usual.\n\nIf the player kills a summoned dragon in the Overworld or Nether, it does not create a portal or an egg.\n\nIn Spectator mode, the player cannot view the perspective of the ender dragon, unlike any other mob.\n\nHowever, it is possible through the use of commands (like / spectate).\n\nWhen this happens, the player's camera appears about 1 block over the dragon's body.\n\nUsing F3 + B  [JE only ] to show hitboxes reveals that the ender dragon's head rotation faces in the opposite direction to where its real head faces.\n\nThis is also why the ender dragon faces the wrong way when set in a monster spawner.\n\nWhen an ender dragon is spawned in the Overworld, it flies to coordinates X=0 and Z=0 and dives at the ground or does the same behavior as if in the End.\n\nIf end crystals are placed in the Overworld, they heal the dragon as normal, but it does not perch anywhere, and continues to fly around forever.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, there is an unused texture file for a dragon fireball item.\n\nIn Super Smash Bros.\n\nUltimate, one of the spirits that comes with the Steve/Alex DLC is the ender dragon.\n\nIt appears as a Legend-class \"spirit\" that makes the user breathe fire for a long time at the start of each battle.\n\nA wither that is summoned to battle the ender dragon cannot deal damage because the ender dragon flies too fast, and she is immune to projectiles when perching.\n\nIf commands or Creative mode are used to get end portal frames and eyes of ender, a player can basically skip to the end poem.\n\nIf a player destroys ender crystals or even hurts the dragon and then uses a player-made portal, upon returning, the player retains their progress. [BE only ] The end dragon has the longest death sound She is clearly biologically female because she can lay eggs.\n\n(It\u2019s best not to think about this too much with chickens and cows) On Reddit, Notch suggested the ender dragon's name to be \"Jean?\" in the same manner he called the player \"Steve?\".\n\n[6] Dinnerbone later stated that he thinks the name is officially \"Jean?\".\n\n[7] Despite this, an article on Minecraft.net states that \"uttering its true name would unleash a destructive force that would obliterate not only the End, but the Nether and the Overworld at the same time.\" [8] Notch referred to the ender dragon as a she on Reddit [citation needed ], the Xbox avatar item Ender Dragon Pet has the description \"A cuter, friendlier version of his bigger, less playful Minecraft sister,\" and the encyclopedia in Bedrock Edition refers to the dragon with feminine pronouns.\n\nhowever, it has been later confirmed by Notch, [9] Brandon Pearce [10] and Jeb [11] that all mobs in Minecraft have no gender, which would include ender dragon unless they don\u2019t count bosses.\n\nBefore she was textured, Notch reported that he was afraid to texture the ender dragon as she was a complicated model.\n\n[12] In the end, the dragon model was so complex Notch stated that he gave up making the texture manually and wrote a texture packer tool to aid him in adding the texture to the model.\n\nNotch also uploaded the code for the tool so others could use the pack.\n\n(Link to the texture packer) [13] Notch joked about how Minecraft was \"going next-gen\" when deadmau5 mentioned this.\n\n[14] Notch has uploaded a video showing why ender dragons do not spawn in the main world, as they would destroy any block they touch.\n\n[15] On Reddit, Notch explained that ender dragons destroy Overworld matter because \"trying to make an AI to properly navigate arbitrary terrain before the code freeze next tuesday [sic ] isn't feasible\".\n\n[16]

Berries Details Size Adult: Height: 0.7 Blocks Width: 0.6 Blocks Baby: Height: 0.35 Blocks Width: 0.3 Blocks A fox is a passive mob that spawns in taigas, old growth taigas, snowy taigas and mountain groves.\n\nThey are able to carry a single item in their mouth, but prefer food over other items.\n\nFoxes spawn in groups of two to four in taiga, old growth taiga, snowy taiga and grove biomes.\n\n5% of them spawn as baby foxes.\n\nThey can spawn on grass, coarse dirt, podzol, snow blocks, or top snow.\n\nFoxes that spawned in a snowy biome are white.\n\nFoxes have a 20% chance to spawn (via spawn egg or naturally) with one of the following items in their mouth: An adult fox drops 1\u20132 [JE only ] / 1\u20133 [BE only ] experience orbs when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nUpon successful breeding, 1\u20137 are dropped.\n\nKilling a baby fox yields no experience.\n\nFoxes always drop any item they pick up and are still holding (they cannot drop food that they have eaten, for example) and drop items they spawn with naturally with a 100% chance, so: If a fox is killed while holding a totem of undying, then the fox consumes the totem and revives itself instead of dropping the totem.\n\nFoxes occasionally make loud screeches during nighttime, unless a trusted player is near them.\n\nBaby foxes follow adult foxes.\n\nDuring the night, foxes sometimes go to villages.\n\nSnow foxes go to snow villages and red foxes go to any other type of village, preferably taiga villages since foxes spawn in the taiga biome.\n\nFoxes flee from nearby wolves, polar bears or players unless the player approaches them while sneaking.\n\nThey take no damage or speed reduction while moving through sweet berry bushes.\n\nAn animation showing a fox's jump during an attack on a chicken.\n\nFoxes attack chickens, rabbits, cod, salmon and tropical fish, and baby turtles while they are on land.\n\nFoxes don't attack wolves even if they are being attacked by them.\n\nFoxes attack either by running against or by pouncing.\n\nLike rabbits and goats, foxes can pounce more than one block high without status effects or player input.\n\nA fox prepares to pounce by tilting and lowering its head and lowering its body to become shorter.\n\nThen it leaps two blocks into the air, jumping over fences and walls if needed.\n\nIf the target mob moves from its location during this sequence, the pounce misses the target.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, foxes also shake side to side before pouncing and their legs wave while in midair.\n\nWhile foxes are capable of jumping over fences and walls, they cannot see through them.\n\n[1] A fox will not try to attack a mob on the same y-level if there is a fence between them.\n\nRed foxes prefer to attack chickens, rabbits and baby turtles, all of which are on land, over cod, salmon, and tropical fish; conversely, snow foxes prefer to attack cod, salmon and tropical fish over land-dwelling creatures.\n\nA snow fox stuck in a snow layer when attacking.\n\nA fox that pounces into a snow layer becomes momentarily stuck, remaining face-down, emitting particles while shaking, and returning to normal shortly after.\n\nFoxes swim to attack fish in water for food.\n\nBaby foxes following adults into the water cannot swim and may eventually drown.\n\nFoxes attempt to run toward the closest attackable mob, even if attached to a lead, but do not attempt to break the lead.\n\nA fox wakes up from sleeping to attack a mob.\n\nWild wolves are aggressive toward foxes when within 18 [JE only ] /16 [BE only ] blocks.\n\nIn Java Edition, adult polar bears also sneak toward foxes to attack them; in Bedrock Edition adult polar bears attack foxes within 16 blocks.\n\nIn Java Edition, baby polar bears, though normally passive to players, also attempt to attack foxes within 16 blocks or when their adult polar bear attacks one.\n\nFoxes are one of the few mobs in the game that can sleep, along with cats, villagers and bats.\n\nDuring the day, if a thunderstorm is not occurring, foxes attempt to find a space with a sky light level of 14 or less and sleep.\n\nBlock light has no effect on this.\n\nWhile it sleeps, it slowly moves its head up and down.\n\nA fox wakes if approached by a player or mob.\n\nFoxes do not flee if the player approaches while sneaking until the player gets on an adjacent block.\n\nIf the sky light at the fox's position becomes 15 or above, either due to a block above being destroyed or the fox being moved, the fox wakes up.\n\nFoxes can drop and pick up items in their sleep.\n\nTrusting foxes can fall asleep even if attached to a lead.\n\nThey can also be moved with leads while sleeping.\n\nFoxes do not sleep if they are within 12 blocks of an armor stand.\n\nA fox sits down sometimes during the day if the fox cannot find a shaded area to sleep.\n\nThe fox sits for a short time, then hops back up.\n\nFoxes sit down even when attached to a lead or in a boat.\n\nFoxes that have not been bred by the player always sit while in the Nether, even while attached to a lead.\n\nIf any item is on the ground near a fox, it travels to the item and picks it up, and the item appears in the fox's mouth.\n\nHowever, usually a fox chooses to attack a mob over picking up an item.\n\nThis behavior is not limited to food and animal products; a fox can pick up any item that the player can pick up.\n\nHowever, they prefer to pick up food items, and if they have already picked up non-food items, they drop the non-food items to pick up food instead.\n\nA fox can also swap a food item it is holding for a different food item.\n\nA fox eats any food item it picks up (besides cake) after 30 seconds and the fox is affected by any side effects from the food, such as poison or teleportation.\n\nFor example, if a fox eats an enchanted golden apple, it obtains the absorption and effects of the enchanted apple.\n\nIf a fox eats any type of soup or stew, an empty bowl is dropped.\n\nIf a fox is holding a chorus fruit, it eats the fruit and teleports accordingly.\n\nIf there is a stage 3 or 4 sweet berry bush within a 16 block radius of a fox, it sprints toward the bush and eats the berries, dropping the item it was holding.\n\nIt is the only mob not damaged by the sweet berry bush.\n\nIf a fox picks up a weapon or an item with enchantments, such as Looting and Fire Aspect, these items affect the fox's attack as if the fox is wielding the weapon in its main hand, although the item retains its durability when used by the fox.\n\nIf a fox is holding a totem of undying, it receives the effects after taking fatal damage.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, if a fox wields a sword with the Fire Aspect enchantment while attacking a mob on a campfire or a soul campfire, it ignites the campfire and does critical damage to the entity.\n\nFoxes do not pick up items when gamerule mobGriefing is set to false.\n\nWhen sweet berries or glow berries are used on two foxes, the foxes breed, producing a baby fox.\n\nIf a red fox is bred with an snow fox, the baby has a 50% chance of being either red or snow.\n\nBreeding two adults with sweet berries or glow berries produces a kit that trusts the player.\n\nThe baby fox trusts the player that bred it and does not flee from that player as it grows up; however, because baby foxes also follow nearby adult foxes, an adult running away from the player may cause the baby to do the same.\n\nNaturally spawned kits do not trust players.\n\nFoxes attack specific mobs that hurt a player they trust.\n\nA tamed fox with an egg inside its mouth, notice it doesn't run away from the player.\n\nA lead can be useful during this time to keep the baby fox from fleeing until it has finished maturing to an adult itself, or the player can simply kill the adult foxes with a ranged weapon.\n\nA fox that trusts the player flees from wolves and polar bears unless the wolf or polar bear attacks the player, in which case the fox attacks in defense of the player.\n\nWhen attacking phantoms, foxes do not jump to attack.\n\nA trusting fox does not attack a tamed wolf unless the fox doesn't trust the player who tamed the wolf.\n\nFoxes that trust the player attack zombies, drowned, husks, zombified piglins, skeletons, wither skeletons, strays, phantoms, silverfish, endermites, spiders, cave spiders, vexes, vindicators, evokers, pillagers, ravagers, blazes, endermen, goats and pandas, when those mobs attack the player.\n\nThey do not attack any mob the player attacks, unlike tamed wolves.\n\nThey also do not attack zombie villagers despite the fact that they are a zombie variant.\n\nTamed foxes retreat from polar bears and wolves but not tamed wolves.\n\nA tamed wolf whose owner attacks a tamed fox also attacks the fox.\n\nJava Edition: Foxes use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 1.0 for all except idle1, which is 0.8 \u2191 0.9 for all except

hold an item in its mouth, it is technically holding the item in its main hand, therefore anything held affects it, such as a sword increasing its damage or a totem of undying resurrecting it.\n\nIn the real world, some species of fox jump high to catch their prey by surprise, an action reflected in their Minecraft counterpart.\n\nWhen foxes were being added into Minecraft, a glitch occurred where they looked like boxes.\n\n[3] Baby foxes are small enough that when they are swimming, they take drowning damage.\n\nThis is noticeable when they attempt to attack fish.\n\nThere is a splash

frog is a passive mob found in swamps.\n\nFrogs eat small slimes and magma cubes.\n\nA frog can produce one of three kinds of froglights from eating magma cubes, depending on the type of frog.\n\nGroups of two to five frogs can spawn in swamp and mangrove swamp biomes.\n\nFrogs can also be spawned by growing from tadpoles.\n\nThere are three frog variants, determined by the biome in which the tadpole grew up: Notes \u2191 a b Frogs spawn naturally in this biome.\n\nFrogs drop 1\u20133 when killed by a player or tamed wolf, while 1\u20137 is dropped upon successful breeding.\n\nOn land, frogs will slowly wander, jumping at random.\n\nThey can jump 8 blocks high and take 5 less damage from falling than most other mobs.\n\nThey prefer jumping on lily pads and big dripleaves, and will usually jump to blocks that are higher up.\n\nIn water, frogs move much faster.\n\nThey will generally swim upwards and remain at the water's surface, but will swim downwards if lured by a player.\n\nFrogs cannot be hurt by drowning.\n\nOccasionally, they may croak and inflate their vocal sac.\n\nMain article: Tutorials/Frog farming Frogs will follow any player holding a slimeball within 6 blocks of them.\n\nFeeding two frogs a slimeball causes them to enter love mode, causing one of the frogs to become pregnant, similar to turtles.\n\nThe pregnant frog then searches for a water block with at least one adjacent water block (flowing or source) with air above to lay frogspawn.\n\nThis spawn later hatches into tadpoles, which subsequently grow into frogs.\n\nUnlike all other mobs with baby variants, the tadpole is treated by the game as a completely different mob from the frog.\n\nFrogs attack by using their tongue to pull certain mobs into their mouth, whereupon the mob instantly despawns without a death animation.\n\nFrogs attack small slimes, which drop slimeballs when killed.\n\nFrogs also attack small magma cubes, leaving a froglight block.\n\nWhen the magma cube gets targeted, the frog will walk towards it at a faster pace before attacking.\n\nThe color of froglight that drops depends on the type of frog that attacks the magma cube: Java Edition:

section Issues relating to \"Frog\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe warm frog is based on the grey foam-nest tree frog, a real-life species of frog native to Africa.\n\n[2] The temperate frog is based on brown bullfrogs.\n\n[3] [4] Originally, frogs were meant to eat fireflies, but this was scrapped as in real life some fireflies are poisonous to some frogs.\n\nInstead, now they can eat small slimes and small magma cubes.\n\n[5] During the frog's early development, the developers didn't know what the frog was going to eat, so they made the mouth huge.\n\nSome early ideas for what the frog was going to eat included bees.\n\n[6] At one point in Bedrock Edition's development, in beta 1.18.10.26, frogs could eat goats.\n\nHowever, this was later removed as it was leftover prototype code.\n\n[7] This was later referenced in the trailer for Minecraft Live 2022, where a frog eats a goat.\n\nDespite frogs only spawning in mangrove swamps and swamps, a cold frog can spawn naturally if a cold biome borders a swamp or mangrove swamp.\n\nIn Minecraft, all frogs seems to have vocal sacs.\n\nBut in real life, female frogs lack the vocal sacs present in the males.\n\nHowever, since all Minecraft animals are sexless, it's logical for all frogs to have vocal sacs.\n\nPhotographing a frog in the 15 Year map would not get the sticker.\n\nit

therefore, up to two horns can be dropped per goat.\n\nWhen left to wander, goats tend to ascend hills and mountains rather than keep to lowlands.\n\nTheir behavior is marked by jumping high and by opportunistically ramming non-moving mobs.\n\nGoats take 10 less fall damage and avoid walking into powder snow.\n\nGoats do not get hurt by pointed dripstone if they fall on it from a minimum of six blocks, and do not die from pointed dripstone if they fall on it from a minimum of ten.\n\nA goat usually jumps when trying to cross an obstacle like a small hole in the ground or powder snow.\n\nIt lowers its head, then it leaps up to 10 blocks vertically and up to 5 blocks laterally.\n\nOnce a goat jumps this way, it cannot do it again for 30 to 60 seconds.\n\nA goat also never voluntarily jumps more than 5 blocks down, although a goat can be pushed off a higher cliff by another mob or a piston.\n\nStanding on a honey block prevents a goat from jumping.\n\nEvery 30 to 300 seconds, a goat tries to ram a single unmoving target it can see within a range of 4\u201316 blocks.\n\nThey can target players, armor stands, or any mob except for ghasts and other goats.\n\nA charging goat locks on to its target's position, lowers its head, stomps, and speeds toward the target.\n\nIf the charge connects, it deals 1 to 3 damage (depending on difficulty) and 9 blocks of knockback to its target, possibly resulting in a damaging or even fatal fall.\n\nThis attack is not affected by Thorns.\n\n[1] As a goat lowers its head, its target has the chance to move out of the way.\n\nIf a goat misses, it stops itself within a couple blocks, unless it hits a solid block first.\n\nIf a goat rams a solid block that occurs naturally in its environment, it can drop one of its two goat horns.\n\nMobs do not retaliate to being rammed, except for piglins, piglin brutes, hoglins, zoglins, and wardens.\n\n[2] Goats do not target players in Creative mode or any players in Peaceful difficulty.\n\nUnlike most neutral mobs, goats do not attack the player if the player attacks it, and it does not call for backup if harmed.\n\nBaby goats deal a knockback of 4.5 blocks.\n\nA screaming goat's ramming cooldown is 5 to 15 seconds.\n\n[more information needed ] An adult goat can be milked by using a bucket on it, yielding a milk bucket.\n\nMain article: Breeding Goats follow players that are within ten blocks who are holding wheat.\n\nIf adult goats are fed wheat, they enter love mode and breed, granting one to seven experience orbs.\n\nThe growth time of a baby goat can be accelerated by 10% each time it is fed wheat.\n\nIf a standard goat is bred with a screaming goat, there is approximately a 50% chance the resulting baby is a screaming goat.\n\nIf both goats are screaming, there is a 100% chance that the baby is a screaming goat.\n\nBaby goats only have horns if they are summoned through one of two commands: / summon goat ~ ~ ~ {Age:-24000, HasLeftHorn:1} or / summon goat ~ ~ ~ {Age:-24000, HasRightHorn:1}.\n\nThe goat's third hurt sound (screaming) and its first ramming preparation sound (also screaming) are the same, but pitched differently; the former is pitched higher than the latter.\n\nThe goat's fourth death sound (regular) is its first ambient sound (also for regular goats) but lower pitched.\n\nThe goat's second ramming preparation sound (screaming) is its fifth ambient sound (also screaming) but higher pitched.\n\nThe goat's first and third ramming preparation sounds (both for screaming goats) are its first ramming preparation sound (regular goats) but heavily edited.\n\nJava Edition: Goats use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nGoats use the Hostile Creatures sound category for some sound events.\n\n\u2191 0.84 for all except idle1 and idle2, which are 0.82, and idle7, which is 0.83 \u2191 0.9 for all screaming sounds;

breedable hostile mob found in the Nether, and a source of porkchops and leather.\n\nA hoglin attacks by thrusting its tusks upward, which can also launch its target a short distance into the air.\n\nHoglins are repelled by warped fungi that is placed in the world as well as active nether portals and respawn anchors.\n\nBaby hoglins behave similarly, but have a much weaker attack (the weakest attack in the game) with normal knockback, and flee when hit.\n\nHoglins are found in herds of 3\u20134 in crimson forests, respawning over time.\n\nThey can spawn at any light level and on most solid blocks other than nether wart blocks and shroomlights.\n\nHoglins spawn in certain types of bastion remnants upon structure generation.\n\nThey spawn frequently in the hoglin stable variant (specifically the large and small stables in the \"lower\" area, but never in the \"upper\" area with ramparts), and sometimes in the main \"bridge entrance\" at the upper half of the rampart in the bridge variant.\n\nSimilarly to the piglins and piglin brutes there, these hoglins never despawn.\n\n20% of hoglins spawn as babies.\n\nHoglins spawn in Peaceful difficulty, but are passive to players.\n\nAdult hoglins drop when killed: 2\u20134 raw porkchop (cooked porkchop while on fire).\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 7 with Looting

wolf.\n\nBaby hoglins drop only experience when killed, at the same rate as adult hoglins.\n\nThey are also the only mobs that both grow up and also drop experience.\n\nHoglins avoid warped fungi (including in a flower pot), nether portals and respawn anchors, and will run away from them when within 7 blocks of them.\n\nThey naturally sink in water and eventually drown.\n\n[1] They also sink in lava and are vulnerable to fire damage.\n\n[2] Hoglins can be led with a lead despite the fact they are hostile.\n\nHoglins attack any player within 16 blocks with a reach of 1.9 blocks.\n\nAn adult knocks its target upward.\n\nPlayers can still be flung even if they block with a shield.\n\nHoglins do not attack a player standing near a block that repels them, but run away from the block unless they have already chosen to attack.\n\nHoglins are 60% resistant to knockback.\n\nUnlike other hostile mobs, they do not prevent a player from sleeping.\n\nSimilarly to piglins and zombified piglins, a player or mob attacking a hoglin provokes all nearby hoglins.\n\nAttacking a baby hoglin does not trigger this behavior.\n\nIf a piglin attacks a hoglin, all the hoglins in the area retaliate.\n\nHoglins also flee if outnumbered and make retreating sounds.\n\nIf the piglins are outnumbered by hoglins, they flee and make retreating sounds.\n\nHoglins that spawn upon generation of bastion remnants are not hunted by piglins.\n\nBaby hoglins also attack the player, dealing much less damage and normal knockback.\n\nIf the player attacks a baby hoglin, it temporarily flees.\n\nBaby piglins run near and ride baby hoglins.\n\nIf there are more baby piglins than baby hoglins, the baby piglins occasionally jump on other baby piglins already riding a baby hoglin, with a maximum of 3 stacked on a single baby hoglin.\n\nA hoglin turning into a zoglin.\n\nNotice the hair is flattened down.\n\nIf a hoglin spawns in or moves to the Overworld or the End, it shakes and then transforms into a zoglin after 15 seconds.\n\nThe newly-created zoglin gets Nausea I for 10 seconds.\n\nThis Nausea effect is only decorative and has no effect on the zoglin's behavior.\n\nIn Java Edition, any lead attached to the hoglin breaks when it converts, even though zoglins can have leads attached to them.\n\n[3] Main article: Breeding Other than the killer bunny  [Java Edition only ], the hoglin is the only hostile mob that can be bred.\n\nHoglins can be bred using crimson fungi.\n\nIt takes 5 minutes before the parents can be bred again, and it takes 20 minutes for baby hoglins to mature.\n\nBaby hoglins stay near their parents unless they see a player or get attacked, in which case they attack or run away.\n\nFeeding a crimson fungus to a baby hoglin reduces the remaining time for it to mature by 10%.\n\nHoglins cannot be bred when they are running away from warped fungi, respawn anchors or nether portals.\n\nFeeding crimson fungi to a hoglin prevents it from despawning, regardless of whether the breeding is successful or not.\n\nThe baby hoglin produced by breeding does not despawn either.\n\nJava Edition: Hoglins use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 Except idle1, which is 0.65, and idle4, which is 0.7 \u2191 a b c MC-98316 \u2014 Wrong subtitles caused by missing distinction \u2191 Except for retreat1 (the

300.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Hoglin\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe reason Hoglins run away from warped fungi is because they dislike their smell.\n\n[7] Similarly, when asked if nether portals smell bad to Hoglins, Henrik responded saying that the reason Hoglins run away from Nether Portals is because they find the sound annoying.\n\n[8] Similar to the ravager originally being called \" illager beast\" before its official name was chosen by the community, the Hoglin's name was also chosen by the community.\n\nIts initial placeholder name was \"piglin beast\".\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, there are unused texture files named hoglin_meat_raw and hoglin_meat_cooked that are textured identically to raw and cooked beef, respectively.\n\nHenrik Kniberg released a video [9] of a group of hoglins killing a piglin, then \"celebrating\" by bobbing their heads, then getting on their hind legs and

[Java Edition only ] Unlike other passive mobs, horses slowly regenerate health.\n\nTamed (and untamed [Java Edition only ]) horses can be led by a player holding a golden carrot, golden apple, or enchanted golden apple.\n\nBaby horses follow adult horses.\n\nTaming a horse is required to breed it, to give it equipment, or to control it while riding.\n\nA player mounts a horse by pressing use on it with an empty hand, or while holding an object that cannot be used on a horse.\n\nA player tames an adult horse by repeatedly mounting it until the horse stops bucking off the player.\n\nTaming depends on the horse's \"temper\".\n\nHorses begin with a temper of 0 out of 100.\n\nWhen a player first mounts the horse, a random taming threshold 0\u201399 is chosen.\n\nThe horse becomes tame if the temper exceeds this threshold.\n\nOtherwise, the player is bucked off and the temper is increased by 5, to be compared against the threshold the next time the player mounts the horse.\n\nTemper can also be increased by feeding the horse.\n\nAfter repeated mountings, hearts appear above the horse, indicating that it is tamed.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, like all tame animals, when a horse is killed, a death message is displayed to every player.\n\nFeeding two tamed horses golden apples or golden carrots activates love mode, causing them to mate and produce a foal.\n\nThe foal appears more spindly than adult horses and grows in stages to full size with time.\n\nThe foal can be fed to make it mature faster.\n\nDepending on the variations of the parent horses, the offspring can be one of several types.\n\nBred with a horse: Breeding two horses produces a horse foal.\n\nUsually, the new foal has the color and markings of one of its parents, although there is a 13 \u2044 45 chance of having a random color/markings (which may still end up being the same as one of the parents).\n\nBred with donkey: Cross-breeding a horse with a donkey creates a mule foal.\n\nMules cannot breed.\n\nThis unlocks the Artificial Selection achievement. [Bedrock Edition only ] This is a table representing the probabilities of the color and markings of the foal when breeding two horses A and B.\n\nFeeding a horse food can alter its behavior, cause it to grow (if it is not yet an adult; foals normally take 20 minutes to fully mature if not fed), and/or restore its health.\n\nThe table below lists the effects of the various foods horses can take.\n\nZombie and skeleton horses cannot be fed, even if tamed.\n\nTo feed a horse, hold a valid food item and press use on the horse.\n\nFeeding invalid food causes the player to mount the horse.\n\nHorses can be fed only when feeding would have an effect, similar to other animals.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Horses All horses have three \"equine stats\" that vary from horse to horse: health, (maximum) movement speed, and jump height.\n\nThese stats are created once the horse is born or spawned, and are not affected by food.\n\nWhen spawned in any way except breeding \u2013 for instance, using commands, spawning naturally, spawning as part of a skeleton trap, or using spawn eggs \u2013 horses are assigned their stats within certain ranges.\n\nHorse's hearts ranges from 15\u201330, with an average of 22.5 \u00d7 11.25.\n\nDisplayed hearts are health, divided by two, rounded down.\n\nA horse with an odd number of health points (15, 17, 19, etc.) does not show the last half-heart.\n\nOne may test this by hitting a horse: if the horse has lost one-half heart from one punch, it has an even number of health points.\n\nOtherwise, odd.\n\nHorse's movement speed ranges from 0.1125\u20130.3375 in internal units, with an average of 0.225.\n\nFor reference, the player's normal walking speed is 0.1.\n\nThe speed listed does not include any status effect that affects the speed of the horse or the player.\n\nThe conversion factor between internal units and blocks/sec is roughly 43.17.\n\nHowever, horses instead travel at just shy of 42.16 blocks/sec times their internal attribute, putting the best horse's maximum speed at 14.23 blocks/second, and the average horse's speed at about 9.49 blocks/sec.\n\nMinimum: 4.85 blocks/sec.\n\nPlayer speed (walking): 4.317 blocks/sec.\n\nPlayer speed (sprinting): 5.612 blocks/sec.\n\nSee also transportation methods to compare the speeds of various transportation methods.\n\nHorse's jump strength ranges from 0.4\u20131.0, with an average of 0.7.\n\nA jump strength of 0.5 is enough to clear 1 9 \u2044 16 blocks, while 1.0 is enough to clear 5 1 \u2044 4 blocks.\n\nWhen breeding two horses, or a horse and a donkey, the foal's stats are determined by averaging both parent's stats and adding a random variation to it.\n\nThe variant of the child has an 11% chance to be a random base color, and a 20% chance to have random markings.\n\nOtherwise, it chooses the values from one of its parents.\n\nJava Edition: Horses use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 Except for stems, Nether wood, cherry wood, and bamboo wood due to MC-257246 Bedrock Edition: \u2191 This sound event is assigned to the horse for adding a chest, but is not called by the game \u2191

tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nA horse with a rider can be pulled by a lead, and can even be lifted into the air.\n\nHorses eating golden foods comes from the Greek myth of Arion, a superfast

[Bedrock Edition only ] Llama spit cannot pass through any blocks including non-solid blocks (e.g.\n\nsigns, open fence gates, and sugar cane) this even includes water.\n\nThe spitting animation will still show the trajectory, but the spit entity that does damage will terminate on the non-solid block.\n\nLlama spit can be blocked by a shield.\n\nAdult tamed llamas can be bred by being fed a hay bale.\n\nThe baby llama takes on the coat color of one parent at random.\n\nIts strength is chosen as a random integer between 1 and the strength of the stronger parent, inclusive.\n\n3% of the time the resulting strength is increased by 1, but it is capped at 5.\n\nWhen two trader llamas are bred, the offspring wears a rug.\n\nSelect a row based on the stronger parent.\n\nThe column shows the probability of the resulting offspring having a given strength.\n\nA llama's base health (15 to 30 HP) is calculated based on that of its parents, in the same way as a horse 's.\n\nLlamas can be tamed by repetitively riding them until hearts are displayed, done by pressing use on the llama while holding nothing.\n\nTaming success depends on the llama's Temper NBT.\n\nTemper is a positive trait, with higher values increasing the chance of successful taming.\n\nLlamas begin with a Temper value of 0 and a maximum of 100.\n\nWhen a player rides an untamed llama, a random number from 0 to 99 is chosen.\n\nThe llama gets tamed successfully if this number is less than the Temper value, otherwise, the Temper is increased by 5 and the player is bucked off.\n\nTemper can also be increased by feeding the llama.\n\nTamed llamas can still retaliate at players should the player hit them.\n\nIf a player kills a wandering trader and stays away from the trader llamas for a while, the llamas are tame when the player rides it and the player can place carpets on the llama.\n\nNaturally spawned trader llamas are untamed and cannot be ridden while being led by their wandering trader.\n\nIf unleashed, they become tamable [Java Edition only ] or tamed.

do not spawn naturally, but they can spawn through cross-breeding a horse with a donkey.\n\nMules cannot breed with other mules.\n\n20% of mule spawn eggs produce foals.\n\nMules are the offspring of horses and donkeys and are closer to (but not quite) the size of a normal horse.\n\nTheir ears, coats, and manes are like those of a donkey, though mules' coats are darker and reddish-brown.\n\nLike donkeys, mules cannot be equipped with armor but can be equipped with chests.\n\nMules cannot have foals, much like mules in real life.\n\nUnlike almost all other mobs, mules with equipped saddles or chests do not render them when under the effect of Invisibility.\n\n[1] Upon death, mules drop: 0\u20132 Leather.\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-5

Tamed and saddled mules can be used as a means of transportation in the game.\n\nMules cannot float on water when being controlled by a player.\n\nThey can be ridden in water up to 2 blocks deep.\n\nIn deeper water, the player is automatically dismounted.\n\n[2] Mules can be equipped with chests and used as pack animals.\n\nThey can be pulled along and tied up using a lead.\n\nGUI of a mule.\n\nTamed mules have the following slot available: Saddle Slot: For equipping a saddle.\n\nAn additional 15 inventory slots, provided the mule has been equipped with a chest.\n\nEquipment can be placed on a mule by holding it and then using on the mule, or by accessing its inventory.\n\nA mule\u2019s inventory can be accessed by mounting the mule and using inventory control, or by sneaking and then using or pressing the \"open inventory\" button  [Bedrock Edition only ] on the mule.\n\nA mule starts out with just a saddle slot, but if it is given a chest, it acquires 15 more inventory slots that can hold anything the player wishes.\n\nChests can be given to a mule by using it with the chest in hand, and the chest cannot be removed except by killing the mule.\n\nUpon death, the mule drops the attached chest and its contents.\n\nFoals cannot be equipped with anything.\n\nMain article: Riding Once a mule is tamed and saddled, the player can control it with standard directional controls, jump, and the mouse.\n\nThe player dismounts using the dismount control.\n\nFor a long time, it was impossible for a player to use a nether portal or end portal while on a mule, until snapshot 24w21b, when minecraft added the new \"entitiesWithPassengersCanUsePortals\" gamerule, allowing minecarts, boats, and animals like pigs or horses to be ridden through a portal A ridden saddled mule automatically runs up any one block high slope.\n\nThe mule and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high.\n\nLower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block.\n\nThe mule itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks.\n\nMules cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.\n\nThe maximum speed of mules, when created by breeding a horse and a donkey, varies between 4.8375 blocks/second and 14.5125 blocks/second (compared to the player's walking speed, which is about 4.3 blocks/second).\n\nAbout 68% of mules are able to go faster than a minecart.\n\nAny mule spawned with its spawn egg always has a speed of 7.525 blocks/second, which is slower than a minecart at full speed.\n\nMules are slow-moving backward, and about as fast as the player when moving sideways.\n\nRidden saddled mules have the ability of \"jumping charging\".\n\nWhen the player rides them, the experience bar on HUD is replaced by jumping charging bar.\n\nA ridden saddled mule can be made to jump and holding the control charges for a higher leap.\n\nMules are not affected by jump boost beacons or potions.\n\nAll mules roam idly, occasionally stopping to rear, swish their tails, or lower their heads as though eating the grass.\n\nUnlike sheep, the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed.\n\nMules turn to look at any player that comes near.\n\nAny mule, even a wild one, allows itself to be attached to a lead without protest.\n\nHowever, if the player attempts to saddle an untamed mule, it rears and flails its front hooves.\n\nMules, like most mobs, can ride in a minecart and boat.\n\nUnlike other passive mobs, mules slowly regenerate health.\n\nAdult mules can be tamed: with an empty hand, mount the mule repeatedly; when it no longer bucks the player and shows hearts, it is tamed.\n\nIt is necessary to tame a mule in order to give it equipment or ride it for any length of time.\n\nTaming depends on the mule's \"temper\".\n\nMules begin with a temper of 0 out of 100.\n\nWhen a player is riding the mule, a random number between 0 and 99 is chosen.\n\nThe mule becomes tame if this number is less than the temper, otherwise, the temper is increased by 5 and the player is bucked off.\n\nTemper can also be increased by feeding the mule.\n\nWhile riding an untamed mule, a galloping sound is audible, more or less rapid to give a general idea of the mule's speed.\n\nIt is unknown whether there is any indication of jump height before taming.\n\nLike all tamed animals, a death message is displayed to their owner if they are killed. [Bedrock Edition only ] Like their real-life counterparts, mules in Minecraft cannot produce offspring.\n\nThe only way to produce a mule (other than using a spawn egg) is to cross-breed a horse with a donkey.\n\nFeeding a mule food can alter its behavior, cause it to grow (if it is not yet an adult; foals normally take 20 minutes to fully mature if not fed), and/or restore its health.\n\nThe table below lists the effects of the various foods mules eat.\n\nTo feed a mule, hold a valid food item and press use on the mule.\n\nIf the food is invalid, the player simply mounts the mule.\n\nMules can be fed only when feeding would have an effect, similar to other animals.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Horses Mules have three \"equine stats\" that vary from mule to mule: health, (maximum) movement speed, and jump strength.\n\nThese stats are created once the mule is born or spawned, and are not affected by food.\n\nWhen spawned in any way except breeding \u2013 for instance, using commands or using spawn eggs \u2013 mules are assigned their stats within certain ranges, specific according to their horse type.\n\nA mule's health ranges from 15\u201330, but tends toward the average of 22\u201323.\n\nDisplayed hearts are health, divided by two, rounded down.\n\nA mule with a non-even number of health points (15, 17, 19, etc.) does not show the last half-heart.\n\nIf the mule has lost one fewer health point than the inflicted damage and did not regenerate, it has an odd number of health points, otherwise, it has an even number of health points.\n\nSpawned mules' speed is always 0.175; the player's normal walking speed is 0.1.\n\nThe speed listed does not include any status effect that affects the speed of a horse or a player.\n\nBred mules have speed based on their parent's speeds, like all other horse breeding.\n\nSee transportation to compare the speeds of various transportation methods.\n\nSpawned mules' jump strength is usually 0.5, which is enough to clear 1 9 \u2044 16 blocks.\n\nOther jump strengths can be found in bred mules, depending on the statistics of the parents (as explained later).\n\nWhen breeding a horse and a donkey, the foal's stats are determined by a variation of the average of both parents' stats, randomly determined as horses' stats are.\n\nJava Edition: Mules use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b c MC-98316 \u2014 Wrong subtitles caused by missing distinction Bedrock Edition: \u2191 Except for stems, Nether wood, cherry wood, and bamboo wood due to MCPE-165012 Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Mules have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Additional fields for mobs that can breed Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Tags common to all horses ChestedHorse: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the horse has chests.\n\nA chested horse that is not a donkey or a mule crashes the game.\n\nItems: List of items.\n\nOnly exists if ChestedHorse is true.\n\nAn item, including the Slot tag.\n\nSlots are numbered 2 to 16 for donkeys and mules, and none exist for all other horses.\n\nTags common to all items Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Mule\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nA \"mule\" specifically refers to the offspring of a male donkey (jack) and a female horse (mare).\n\nThe offspring of a female donkey (jenny) and a male horse (stallion) is called a \"hinny\".\n\nBecause mules are way more common than hinnies however, \"mule\" can colloquially refer to any donkey-horse hybrid.\n\nA herd of various horses and a baby mule.\n\nA donkey and a mule.\n\nHorse Donkey Skeleton Horse Zombie Horse Llama \u2191 MC-13738 \u2191 MC-72440 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 \"Also big thanks to @DrZhark, the creator of Mo' Creatures, that have assisted us to make it happen!\" \u2013 @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X, April 4, 2013 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

(not including shoots) within a five-block radius; [verify ] otherwise the pandas will briefly shake their heads and not breed until that requirement is met.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, there must be at least 8 bamboo blocks within a five-block radius of each panda in order for them to enter love mode.\n\nIf a panda is fed without a sufficient amount of bamboo nearby, it sits and eats the bamboo instead of entering love mode.\n\nOnce pandas successfully breed, they produce a panda cub which remains passive instead of neutral toward that player.\n\nEach panda has two hidden values called \" genes \" or \"alleles\", as found in genetics.\n\nPandas have a main gene and a hidden gene, each assigned to a particular trait.\n\nNormal, aggressive, lazy, worried, and playful personalities are dominant traits, while weak and brown personalities are recessive traits.\n\nIf the main gene is a dominant gene, then it will present as the personality regardless of the hidden gene.\n\nIf the main gene is recessive and the hidden gene is not the same trait, then a normal personality results.\n\nAs recessive traits, weak and brown personalities occur if both the main and hidden genes of a panda are weak or brown, respectively.\n\nThe hidden gene is only relevant in determining the panda's personality if the main gene is recessive.\n\nWhen two pandas breed, each one passes one of their genes to their children, who then randomly mix both obtained genes as their respective main and hidden genes.\n\nThere is also a 1 \u2044 32 chance for each gene of the baby to mutate into another gene.\n\nNormal, weak, and brown traits more commonly result from mutations than other traits do.\n\nThese probabilities also apply to naturally spawned pandas for their main and hidden genes.\n\nThe

[Bedrock Edition only ] Unlike other fish, pufferfish don't swim in schools.\n\nLike other fish, pufferfish cannot survive out of water.\n\nOutside of water, they flop around like guardians for a while until they start suffocating, and then die like squid.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition they rotate when flopping.\n\nFish cannot swim or breathe in cauldron water.\n\n[4] All fish are vulnerable to weapons that have the Impaling enchantment, which also affects squid, turtles, guardians, elder guardians, and dolphins.\n\nA pufferfish inflates when approached by a player in Survival or Adventure mode, a drowned, an axolotl, or any non-water mob within a 5\u00d75\u00d75 volume around the fish, going from unpuffed, then semi-puffed, to fully puffed.\n\nPufferfish are technically passive mobs but going near one when semi-puffed or fully puffed inflicts the player/mob with three or six seconds of Poison based on the inflation level, and touching one in its puffed or semi-puffed form deals damage separate from the Poison.\n\nPufferfish also instantly inflate to their fullest form after taking any kind of damage. [Bedrock Edition only ] After inflating, they slowly deflate to their normal shape as long as a threat is out of range.\n\nIf the player/mob leaves the radius while the pufferfish is in its semi-puffed stage, it deflates back to normal.\n\nUndead mobs are unaffected by the Poison effect, but still, take damage when they come into contact with pufferfish.\n\nA pufferfish inflicting damage to a mob other than creeper and ghast via touching provokes that mob to retaliate.\n\nIn Peaceful difficulty, pufferfish do not inflict damage or Poison to player.

each use reduces 10% of the remaining time to grow up.\n\nDespite their hostile nature, killer bunnies can breed with other rabbits and with each other, having the unusual chance of creating a baby killer bunny.\n\nA Toast rabbit does not produce a Toast rabbit baby, however.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, baby rabbits follow their parents; this behavior is absent in Java Edition.\n\n[2] The six natural types of rabbits.\n\nRabbits typically spawn using one of six different skins.\n\nSkins include regular brown fur, white fur with red eyes (albino), black mottled fur, black and white spotted fur, gold (cream) fur, and salt and pepper fur.\n\nThe biome determines the skin used: Rabbits in snowy biomes have 80% white fur and 20% black and white fur.\n\nRabbits in deserts have 100% gold fur.\n\nRabbits in other biomes have 50% brown fur, 40% salt & pepper fur, and 10% black fur.\n\nRabbits with specific skins can be spawned using / summon rabbit ~ ~ ~ {RabbitType: (Number from 0 - 5)}  [Java Edition only ] or / summon rabbit ~ ~ ~ in_desert (gold)/in_snow (white)  [Bedrock Edition only ].\n\nWhile it is possible to go above 5, this results in rabbits with skins identical to RabbitType: 0, with the exception of RabbitType: 99, the Killer Bunny.\n\nThere are two special variants of rabbits: This feature is exclusive to Java Edition.\n\nThe current killer bunny texture The killer bunny is an aggressive variant of the rabbit exclusive to Java Edition that is hostile toward players, foxes, and wolves.\n\nIts fur is pure white with blood-red eyes that are horizontal, compared to a normal rabbit's vertical eyes.\n\nIt can be spawned only by using the / summon rabbit ~ ~ ~ {RabbitType:99} command.\n\nIt appears with a nameplate over its head reading \"The Killer Bunny\".\n\nIf the killer bunny finds any player within a 16-block radius, it hops toward the player much faster than a normal rabbit.\n\nIt moves in a style similar to that of a spider.\n\nOnce it closes in, it jumps at the player, dealing 8 damage on Normal difficulty.\n\nIf the player strikes at the killer bunny, it runs away for a brief moment, then returns to lunging at the player.\n\nKiller bunnies are immune to the Thorns enchantment.\n\nIf it cannot find a player, the killer bunny actively seeks out and attacks any foxes or wolves, including tamed wolves.\n\nThese mobs, in return, attack the killer bunny, leading to a vicious fight.\n\nOn peaceful difficulty, the killer bunny does not despawn, despite its hostile nature.\n\nIt still attacks wolves and tamed wolves, but not the player.\n\nThe killer bunny can be bred and leashed and follows players holding carrots, despite its hostile nature.\n\n\"Toast\" redirects here.\n\nFor messages displayed on-screen, see Toasts, Advancements, Recipes, or Tutorial hints.\n\nFor Bread, see Bread.\n\nThe rabbit named \"Toast\" Naming a rabbit Toast (using either a name tag or a renamed spawn egg) re-textures it to have the appearance of a black Dutch, with a large black and white patch and more black fur around the face than the natural black and white spotted rabbit.\n\nOther than its name and skin, Toast behaves exactly like it would if it were unnamed.\n\nWhen Toast rabbits are bred, whether with each other or with regular rabbits, their offspring do not have the Toast pattern; they have a pattern consistent with the parents' original coloring prior to renaming.\n\nIf the player renames a killer bunny to Toast, it still attacks players and wolves.\n\nLike the killer bunny, Toast does not spawn naturally.\n\nThis rabbit is the skin of user xyzen420's girlfriend's missing rabbit, which Ryan Holtz implemented as a memorial.\n\n[3] Java Edition: Regular rabbits use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nKiller bunnies use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Rabbits have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Additional fields for mobs that can breed Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs MoreCarrotTicks: Set to 40 when a carrot crop is eaten, decreases by 0\u20132 every tick until it reaches 0.\n\nHas no effect in game.\n\nRabbitType: Determines the skin of the rabbit.\n\nAlso determines if rabbit should be hostile.\n\nMain article: Rabbit/DV [edit ] Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nNote: this video is outdated as rabbits can no longer be tamed, rabbits are smaller now, and the killer rabbit is now called the killer bunny.\n\nIssues relating to \"Rabbit\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe Killer Bunny is a reference to the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog from the British comedy film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which it was formerly named.\n\nThe Killer Bunny was suggested by X user @88bully.\n\n[7] The death sound for the rabbit is called bunnymurder.ogg.\n\nA brown rabbit running.\n\nRyan Holtz modeling the rabbit.\n\nThe first image of a rabbit tweeted by Ryan Holtz.\n\nThe second image of a rabbit tweeted by Ryan Holtz.\n\nThe third image of a rabbit tweeted by Ryan Holtz.\n\nThe fourth image of a rabbit tweeted by Ryan Holtz.\n\nThe fifth image of a rabbit tweeted by Ryan Holtz.\n\nBaby rabbits.\n\nFirst image of Toast.\n\nSecond image of Toast.\n\nThird image of Toast.\n\nFourth image of Toast.\n\nThe first image of the Killer Bunny.\n\nThe second image of the Killer Bunny.\n\nA pen of rabbits.\n\nThe second Killer Bunny texture, similar to a normal white rabbit.\n\nAll of the available rabbit skins.\n\nThe Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog as a baby.\n\nThe third Killer Bunny texture, with blood on its mouth and paws.\n\nKiller bunny.\n\nA rabbit eating a carrot.\n\nLego Minecraft Black Rabbit.\n\nLego Minecraft Baby Brown Rabbit.\n\nA rabbit in official artwork for The Wild Update.\n\nRabbit art.\n\nJumbo Rabbit from Minecraft Earth.\n\nA rabbit preparing to shoot Steve with a crossbow.\n\n[8] The White Rabbit texture in Bedrock Edition 1.9.\n\n\u2191 MC-207993 \u2191 MC-158608 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 \"@xyZenTV The skin only appears when you name the rabbit Toast using a name tag, it isn't in the random pool:\" \u2013 @TheMogMiner (Ryan Holtz) on X, July 1, 2014 \u2191 https://minecraft.net/article/who-framed-killer-rabbit \u2191 \"FYI, I asked Josh to remove this feature again.\n\nAlthough funny, being scared of rabbits doesn't fit with the Beast's lore.\" \u2013 @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X, October 30, 2018 \u2191 MC-96449 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 \"@88bully @xyZenTV You, I like you.\n\nI like the way you think.\n\nHowever, no promises.\n\nPromises are made to be broken.\" \u2013 @TheMogMiner (Ryan Holtz) on X, June 6, 2014 \u2191 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-85xXgFHlE Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

Height: 1.75 Blocks Width: 1.9 Blocks Snifflet: Height: 0.7875 Blocks Width: 0.855 Blocks A sniffer is a passive mob that does not spawn naturally, and can only be hatched from sniffer eggs.\n\nIt sniffs out and digs out seeds for various unique decorative plants out of dirt, grass, and moss blocks.\n\nSniffers spawn by hatching from sniffer eggs found in suspicious sand from warm ocean ruins.\n\nBreeding sniffers with torchflower seeds would also result in a sniffer egg being laid as an item.\n\nWhen killed, adult sniffers drop 1\u20133 experience points if killed by a player or a tamed wolf; snifflets drop no experience just like other baby animals.\n\nUpon successful breeding, 1\u20137 is dropped.\n\nSniffers wander aimlessly, avoiding hazards and obstacles.\n\nThey occasionally smell their surroundings and track ancient seeds by pressing their nose to the ground.\n\nWhen they find a seed, they sploot [1] and use their noses to dig into the ground until they get torchflower seeds or a pitcher pod.\n\nFor a sniffer to be able to dig it needs to be doing nothing else, not in water, on the ground, not in a boat or minecart and the block underneath the head needs to be diggable and reachable for the sniffer.\n\nThe head location is defined as 2.25 blocks in front of the center of the body.\n\nThe sniffer also stores the last 20 locations it has dug up so it can't dig there anymore.\n\nAfter sniffing out seeds, an eight minute cooldown is activated before it can dig in again.\n\nThe following blocks are diggable by the sniffer: Dirt Grass Block Podzol Coarse Dirt Rooted Dirt Moss Block Mud Muddy Mangrove Roots Data packs from Java Edition can change this list by modifying the minecraft:sniffer_diggable_block block tag.\n\nSniffers cannot dig on mycelium.\n\n[2] The player can breed the sniffers using torchflower seeds.\n\nWhen two adult sniffers are bred, they drop a sniffer egg, after which the parents have a 5-minute cooldown before they can breed again.\n\nSniffers are healed by 2 health points each time they are fed a torchflower seed.\n\nA baby sniffer is called a snifflet [3] and they have a bigger head than the adult.\n\nSnifflets take 48000 game ticks to grow up into adult sniffers, which is equal to 40 minutes or two in-game days, twice as long as most other baby mobs in the game.\n\nUnlike most baby mobs, snifflets do not follow their adults.\n\n[4] Java Edition: Sniffers use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 MC-260219 \u2014 Sniffer eating sounds aren't

level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Sniffer\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe sniffer was originally a doodle Nekofresa made in their kitchen.\n\n[5] The sniffer was Nekofresa's first mob ever designed for Minecraft.\n\n[6] The plants that sniffers find are based off kniphofia genus of perennial flowering plants, which can be similarly called \"torch lilies\" as a common name for torchflowers and pitcher pods are loosely based off existing pitcher plants but with an orchid or ornamental vibe.\n\n[7] The sniffer's walking animation was inspired by the leg movement that centipedes do.\n\n[8] During the prototype phase for the sniffer's digging up of items the developers used beds as a placeholder.\n\n[9] Due to the size of the sniffer it was a big challenge for the developers to perfect its pathfinding especially on 1 block edges.\n\nA new team made up of new developers were tasked with developing the sniffer, and most of them had never made a mob before.\n\n[10] The sniffer's digging animation was inspired by the way corgis spread their legs while lying down.\n\n[11] To this day, the developers still don't know what the sniffer's front yellow part is.\n\nWhether it's a beak, a nose, or eyes, or whether it's used for breathing or finding seeds is unknown.\n\n[12] A baby sniffer is called a snifflet in an article on Minecraft.net [13] and in the achievement \"Little Sniffs\".\n\nOriginal ideas for what a baby sniffer would be called were Sniffling, Snort and Snifflet.\n\n[14] Mojang developer Cory Scheviak personally calls sniffers \"snuffleupaguses\".\n\nThe reason why sniffers don\u2019t spawn naturally and are at first only hatched from their preserved eggs is due to the sniffer being extinct prior

[Bedrock Edition only ] In some of snowy biomes, a spider has a 0.8% chance to spawn a stray on its back and form a stray jockey instead. [Bedrock Edition only ] A spider jockey can also be spawned by the command / summon spider ~ ~ ~ {Passengers: [{id:skeleton}]}.\n\nThe spider controls how both mobs move.\n\nThe spider acts like a normal spider and the skeleton acts like a normal skeleton, except its movement is determined by the spider it rides upon.\n\nThe skeleton's arrows can sometimes damage the spider jockey itself, if the spider happens to be in the way of the shot.\n\nUpon death, a spider drops up to two string s.\n\nThe maximum is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for 0 to 5 strings with Looting III.\n\n5 experience orbs are dropped by a spider when it is killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nThere is also a 1 \u2044 3 chance of dropping a spider eye when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nThe maximum amount of spider eyes is increased by 1 per level of Looting.\n\nThe chance of a spider not dropping any spider eyes can be found using the formula 2 / (Looting Level + 3).\n\nFor example, Looting III gives a 1 \u2044 3 chance of not dropping any spider eyes.\n\nA spider stays hostile toward the player and an iron golem as long as the light level immediately around the spider is 11 or less; otherwise, it does not attack unless attacked first.\n\nHostile spiders see up to 16 blocks, continuing to chase even when exposed to well-lit locations.\n\nIf a spider sustains damage from a source other than a direct attack, such as falling, its hostility resets to a neutral state.\n\nIf shot with arrows when outside of the detection range, a spider turns and runs in the direction from which the arrow was fired.\n\nIf the player moves away, the spider continues following the same path unless the player enters the detection range, in which case the spider changes direction and attacks.\n\nAn aggressive spider pounces at close range.\n\nWhen it is swimming in 1-block-deep water it pounces upon touching the submerged floor.\n\nThey can attack when their Y-axis position is changed, biting in mid-air.\n\nSpiders can climb up over solid blocks that are not magma blocks  [Bedrock Edition only ], but do not climb on underside surfaces.\n\nA spider pursuing a player can detect a player through blocks.\n\nIf a spider cannot find an ideal path to the player due to a wall barring the way, it approaches as close as possible to the player's position and proceeds to climb the wall vertically until it gets to the top, even if it loses its aggression toward the player.\n\nWhen a spider loses its aggression, it continues moving forward blindly for 2 seconds; this behavior causes the spider to climb up any walls in its path.\n\nWhen climbing a wall a spider may sometimes reach a corner and become stuck in a climbing status, thus losing and becoming unable to be aggravated.\n\nSpiders gravitate towards cobwebs.\n\nIf a spider tries to go through the world border, it starts climbing the world border instead. [JE only ] Spider can also climb on full boats, full boats with chests and shulkers.\n\nEven though normal spiders do not inflict the Poison status effect, they are immune to it.\n\nThey are also immune to the slowing applied to most mobs when walking through cobwebs.\n\nSpiders flip onto their backs when they die, unlike all other mobs, which land on their sides.\n\nThe Bane of Arthropods enchantment inflicts Slowness IV and deals more damage to spiders.\n\nJava Edition: Spiders use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Spiders have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nThe original spider in 0.26 SURVIVAL TEST development because Markus Persson made it black with red eyes before releasing that version.\n\nA recreation of the original brown spider texture.\n\nA spider during late alpha.\n\nImage of a giant spider shared by Jeb.\n\nIssues relating to \"Spider\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nSpiders are able to climb walls because they are programmed by Jens Bergensten to treat the sides of blocks as ladders.\n\n[9] In normal conditions, spiders actually float above the ground, but this is often not noticeable due to the difference between the player's height and a spider's height.\n\nWhen a spider wanders inside an enclosed space, it often climbs up a wall until reaching the ceiling, after which it become stuck, unable to exit the climbing state even if it is attacked or becomes hostile to the player.\n\n[10] Hurt sound of spiders have the same sound as when a spider is ambient A spider.\n\nA spider spawning on a single block.\n\nWith the same amount of space given, these spiders can spawn under the bottom slabs, but not under the glass blocks, because glass is a full block, even though it is transparent, but slabs are not full blocks.\n\nA spider jockey.\n\nSpiders are one of the most visible mobs at night due to their glowing red eyes.\n\nSpiders climbing.\n\nA view of a spider from below.\n\nSpider shot by a skeleton.\n\nA spider and its monster spawner in a monster room.\n\nA spider in a 1.5\u00d71.5 space.\n\nA spider's vision when spectating it.\n\nThe bottom of a ravine through a spider's eyes.\n\nSpiders can even climb soul sand.\n\nA spider climbing a wall.\n\nA spider jockey spawning with skeleton's head in the glass.\n\nA spider with invisibility during the night.\n\nAnother spider with invisibility during the night.\n\nA spider with the swiftness effect.\n\nA spider with the strengh effect.\n\nA spider with the regenertion effect.\n\nA spider with the invisibility effect.\n\nSpiders in promotional artwork for the second Caves & Cliffs update.\n\nA spider artwork.\n\nA spider artwork.\n\nA spider artwork.\n\nA spider artwork.\n\nLEGO Minecraft Spider.\n\nThe spider plush made by JINX.\n\n\u2191 MCPE-94878 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 MC-188079 \u2191 http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=6273.msg276501#msg276501 \u2191 \"Changed so that wolves and spiders don't make step sounds, and don't destroy crops when they walk on them\" \u2013 @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X, March 30, 2011 \u2191 \"@C418 Sure, if you think it would be better\" \u2013 @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X, March 30, 2011 \u2191 MC-259637 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 MCPE-15 \u2014 resolved as \"Duplicate\".\n\n\u2191 MCPE-4736 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 \"(Official) Minecraft: The Story of Mojang (Pt.\n\n2/2) - Proof of Concept for Feature-Length\" \u2191 MC-154160 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

[JE only ] [3] Striders wearing a saddle always drop the saddle upon death, regardless of whether they spawn wearing it or a player put it on them.\n\nThe only way to remove a saddle from a strider is to kill the strider.\n\nWhen an adult strider is killed by a player or tamed wolf, 1\u20132 [JE only ] / 1\u20133 [BE only ] experience is dropped.\n\nLava does not damage striders.\n\nUnlike most mobs, striders can walk on top of lava without sinking.\n\nUpon being harmed by another mob, striders attempt to flee for a few seconds while making \"retreat\" noises.\n\nStriders are damaged by water, rain, and splash water bottles, which deal damage by 1 per splash water bottle or half-second in water or rain, which can kill them.\n\nWhile in water, they slowly sink while taking damage.\n\nStriders still take damage from rain even if they are in lava.\n\nHowever, they are not harmed when standing in a filled cauldron.\n\nThey are not harmed by snowfall or snowballs.\n\nThey take extra damage from freezing in powder snow.\n\nUnlike piglins and hoglins, striders can exist safely in the Overworld, as long as they are kept away from water and rain.\n\nUnlike some other mobs, striders do not zombify when leaving the Nether.\n\nStriders outside of lava change to a dull purple color, change their expression to more of a frown, shiver, and their legs become slightly shorter.\n\nThey also move slower when outside of lava.\n\n[4] If a strider has the Speed effect applied to it, the strider moves faster on both land and lava (though its land speed is still considerably slow).\n\nIf a zombified piglin is riding a strider, the strider pursues the player if the zombified piglin is angered.\n\nDue to a bug, [5] striders that fall from a height take fall damage when landing in lava source blocks.\n\nThis does not occur for striders that fall into flowing lava.\n\nA baby strider on an adult strider still grows into an adult.\n\nApart from this, adult striders riding other adult striders do not spawn naturally.\n\nBaby striders not riding on an adult follow the closest adult strider.\n\nA strider walking.\n\nA strider shivering and slowed down on land.\n\nMain article: Riding A player riding a strider (click to see animation).\n\nThe player can ride on an adult strider using a saddle.\n\nSimilar to how pigs are controlled using a carrot on a stick, striders move forward automatically while their direction is influenced using a warped fungus on a stick, at a speed of 4.14 m/s if on a flat lava surface (such as the Nether lava sea) or 1.74 m/s if on land.\n\nThey walk especially slowly against the lava flow direction.\n\nWarped fungus on a stick can be used, causing the strider to boost and walk at a greater speed [more information needed ] and taking 1 point of durability from the warped fungus on a stick.\n\nThey also follow players holding a warped fungus or a warped fungus on a stick.\n\nUnlike underwater boats, players riding striders into lava (for example, getting into flowing-only from heights or horizons, static lava from horizons) do not dismount if the strider submerges into the lava, and striders slowly rise back up to the surface if this happens.\n\nHowever, players risk getting burned by the lava while submerged.\n\nHowever, in Java Edition, players cannot start riding a strider that is fully submerged within the lava.\n\nWhen ridden over land, striders automatically walk up any one block high slope.\n\nThey also cross any 1-wide block gap or air space that is only one block higher - diagonally up - when ridden directly upward and not completely sideways to the slope.\n\nTo safely dismount from a strider, a player who does not have Fire Resistance may face a solid block within reach before dismounting to dismount onto that block, [6] instead of at the strider's location (which is usually in lava [7]).\n\nStriders can still be equipped with a saddle while another mob is riding it.\n\nMain article: Breeding If striders are given warped fungus, they breed to create baby striders, granting the player 1\u20137 experience orbs.\n\nThe parent striders have a cooldown of about 5 minutes before they can breed again.\n\nAll babies obtained through breeding take 20 minutes to grow up.\n\nThe growth of baby striders can be slowly accelerated using warped fungus; each use takes 10% off of the remaining time to grow up.\n\nJava Edition: Striders use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b MC-184399 Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Striders have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Additional fields for mobs that can breed Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Saddle: 1 or 0 (true/false) -

each use reduces 10% of the remaining time to grow up.\n\nDespite their hostile nature, killer bunnies can breed with other rabbits and with each other, having the unusual chance of creating a baby killer bunny.\n\nA Toast rabbit does not produce a Toast rabbit baby, however.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, baby rabbits follow their parents; this behavior is absent in Java Edition.\n\n[2] The six natural types of rabbits.\n\nRabbits typically spawn using one of six different skins.\n\nSkins include regular brown fur, white fur with red eyes (albino), black mottled fur, black and white spotted fur, gold (cream) fur, and salt and pepper fur.\n\nThe biome determines the skin used: Rabbits in snowy biomes have 80% white fur and 20% black and white fur.\n\nRabbits in deserts have 100% gold fur.\n\nRabbits in other biomes have 50% brown fur, 40% salt & pepper fur, and 10% black fur.\n\nRabbits with specific skins can be spawned using / summon rabbit ~ ~ ~ {RabbitType: (Number from 0 - 5)}  [Java Edition only ] or / summon rabbit ~ ~ ~ in_desert (gold)/in_snow (white)  [Bedrock Edition only ].\n\nWhile it is possible to go above 5, this results in rabbits with skins identical to RabbitType: 0, with the exception of RabbitType: 99, the Killer Bunny.\n\nThere are two special variants of rabbits: This feature is exclusive to Java Edition.\n\nThe current killer bunny texture The killer bunny is an aggressive variant of the rabbit exclusive to Java Edition that is hostile toward players, foxes, and wolves.\n\nIts fur is pure white with blood-red eyes that are horizontal, compared to a normal rabbit's vertical eyes.\n\nIt can be spawned only by using the / summon rabbit ~ ~ ~ {RabbitType:99} command.\n\nIt appears with a nameplate over its head reading \"The Killer Bunny\".\n\nIf the killer bunny finds any player within a 16-block radius, it hops toward the player much faster than a normal rabbit.\n\nIt moves in a style similar to that of a spider.\n\nOnce it closes in, it jumps at the player, dealing 8 damage on Normal difficulty.\n\nIf the player strikes at the killer bunny, it runs away for a brief moment, then returns to lunging at the player.\n\nKiller bunnies are immune to the Thorns enchantment.\n\nIf it cannot find a player, the killer bunny actively seeks out and attacks any foxes or wolves, including tamed wolves.\n\nThese mobs, in return, attack the killer bunny, leading to a vicious fight.\n\nOn peaceful difficulty, the killer bunny does not despawn, despite its hostile nature.\n\nIt still attacks wolves and tamed wolves, but not the player.\n\nThe killer bunny can be bred and leashed and follows players holding carrots, despite its hostile nature.\n\n\"Toast\" redirects here.\n\nFor messages displayed on-screen, see Toasts, Advancements, Recipes, or Tutorial hints.\n\nFor Bread, see Bread.\n\nThe rabbit named \"Toast\" Naming a rabbit Toast (using either a name tag or a renamed spawn egg) re-textures it to have the appearance of a black Dutch, with a large black and white patch and more black fur around the face than the natural black and white spotted rabbit.\n\nOther than its name and skin, Toast behaves exactly like it would if it were unnamed.\n\nWhen Toast rabbits are bred, whether with each other or with regular rabbits, their offspring do not have the Toast pattern; they have a pattern consistent with the parents' original coloring prior to renaming.\n\nIf the player renames a killer bunny to Toast, it still attacks players and wolves.\n\nLike the killer bunny, Toast does not spawn naturally.\n\nThis rabbit is the skin of user xyzen420's girlfriend's missing rabbit, which Ryan Holtz implemented as a memorial.\n\n[3] Java Edition: Regular rabbits use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nKiller bunnies use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Rabbits have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Additional fields for mobs that can breed Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs MoreCarrotTicks: Set to 40 when a carrot crop is eaten, decreases by 0\u20132 every tick until it reaches 0.\n\nHas no effect in game.\n\nRabbitType: Determines the skin of the rabbit.\n\nAlso determines if rabbit should be hostile.\n\nMain article: Rabbit/DV [edit ] Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nNote: this video is outdated as rabbits can no longer be tamed, rabbits are smaller now, and the killer rabbit is now called the killer bunny.\n\nIssues relating to \"Rabbit\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe Killer Bunny is a reference to the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog from the British comedy film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which it was formerly named.\n\nThe Killer Bunny was suggested by X user @88bully.\n\n[7] The death sound for the rabbit is called bunnymurder.ogg.\n\nA brown rabbit running.\n\nRyan Holtz modeling the rabbit.\n\nThe first image of a rabbit tweeted by Ryan Holtz.\n\nThe second image of a rabbit tweeted by Ryan Holtz.\n\nThe third image of a rabbit tweeted by Ryan Holtz.\n\nThe fourth image of a rabbit tweeted by Ryan Holtz.\n\nThe fifth image of a rabbit tweeted by Ryan Holtz.\n\nBaby rabbits.\n\nFirst image of Toast.\n\nSecond image of Toast.\n\nThird image of Toast.\n\nFourth image of Toast.\n\nThe first image of the Killer Bunny.\n\nThe second image of the Killer Bunny.\n\nA pen of rabbits.\n\nThe second Killer Bunny texture, similar to a normal white rabbit.\n\nAll of the available rabbit skins.\n\nThe Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog as a baby.\n\nThe third Killer Bunny texture, with blood on its mouth and paws.\n\nKiller bunny.\n\nA rabbit eating a carrot.\n\nLego Minecraft Black Rabbit.\n\nLego Minecraft Baby Brown Rabbit.\n\nA rabbit in official artwork for The Wild Update.\n\nRabbit art.\n\nJumbo Rabbit from Minecraft Earth.\n\nA rabbit preparing to shoot Steve with a crossbow.\n\n[8] The White Rabbit texture in Bedrock Edition 1.9.\n\n\u2191 MC-207993 \u2191 MC-158608 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 \"@xyZenTV The skin only appears when you name the rabbit Toast using a name tag, it isn't in the random pool:\" \u2013 @TheMogMiner (Ryan Holtz) on X, July 1, 2014 \u2191 https://minecraft.net/article/who-framed-killer-rabbit \u2191 \"FYI, I asked Josh to remove this feature again.\n\nAlthough funny, being scared of rabbits doesn't fit with the Beast's lore.\" \u2013 @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X, October 30, 2018 \u2191 MC-96449 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 \"@88bully @xyZenTV You, I like you.\n\nI like the way you think.\n\nHowever, no promises.\n\nPromises are made to be broken.\" \u2013 @TheMogMiner (Ryan Holtz) on X, June 6, 2014 \u2191 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-85xXgFHlE Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

3) Rose (Pink; 6) Silver (Light Gray; 8) Teal (Cyan; 9) Plum (Purple; 10) The base color is first, and the pattern color is next if it is different.\n\nThe fish type is determined according to the shape and pattern of the fish: Some varieties of tropical fish don't follow the normal naming system; instead, they reference real-life fish species.\n\nIn Java Edition, these unique fish are limited to the 22 common varieties.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, there are 21 uniquely-named tropical fish, though they are not all the same as in Java Edition.\n\nThese uniquely-named tropical fish aren't different from regular tropical fish in terms of design or behavior.\n\nBedrock edition does not have the Yellowtail Parrotfish.\n\nThese varieties are: \u2191 Sunstreak in Java Edition, SunStreak in Bedrock Edition.\n\nJava Edition: Tropical fish use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 The fish's momentum, with the horizontal axes' velocities multiplied by 0.2 (capped at 1.0) \u2191 a b MC-200508 Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Tropical fish have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs FromBucket: 1 or 0 (true/false) - Whether the fish had ever been released from a bucket.\n\nVariant: A 4-byte integer.\n\nThe least significant byte has a value of either 0 for a small fish, or 1 for a large fish.\n\nValues above 1 result in an invisible fish.\n\nThe next byte has a value from 0\u20135, representing the pattern on the fish.\n\nValues above 5 result in a fish with no pattern.\n\nThe next byte has a value from 0\u201315, representing the color of the fish's body.\n\nThe most significant byte has a value from 0\u201315, representing the color of the fish's pattern.\n\nMain article: Tropical Fish/DV [edit ] The fish sizes and patterns are depicted in the following table, with white body color and dark-gray pattern color.\n\nThe 22 varieties of tropical fish most commonly found throughout the world have Variant tag values from the following table, which also lists what color/shape/patterns come from that value.\n\nThe variant number is the sum of the most significant byte \u00d7 2 24 + second most significant byte \u00d7 2 16 + second least significant byte \u00d7 2 8 + least significant byte.\n\nIssues relating to \"Tropical fish\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nAn ocean with some fish visible.\n\nCod and tropical fish, along with a turtle and squid.\n\nA screenshot of tropical fish up close.\n\nSome tropical fish jumping on land.\n\nTropical Fish as shown in the Update Aquatic artwork.\n\nTropical Fish from Update Aquatic artwork.\n\nTropical Fish in promotional artwork for the first Caves & Cliffs update.\n\nTropical fish in official artwork for The Wild Update.\n\nTropical fish art.\n\nTropical fish art.\n\nTropical fish art.\n\nTropical fish art.\n\nTropical fish art.\n\nIn the texture files of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, there is a hidden texture of a clownfish mob.\n\nClownfish were food items that existed before Update Aquatic, which were replaced by Tropical Fish food items.\n\nIt is likely that clownfish were intended to become a mob before being expanded into over 2700 variants of tropical fish.\n\nCod Salmon Pufferfish \u2191 MC-212795 \u2014 Salmon & Fish mobs are not affected by Looting \u2191 MC-126819 \u2013 \"fish bouncing and suffocating on top of the cauldron which fills with water\" resolved as \"Won't Fix\" \u2191 MC-169763 Resolved as \"Works as Intended\" \u2191 MC-221656 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

of scutes, which drop from baby turtles when they mature into adults.\n\nTurtles spawn on the sand in the Overworld on beaches with daylight, but not in its snowy variant or stony shores, occasionally in small groups of up to 5 individuals.\n\n10% of turtles spawned are babies.\n\nIn Java Edition, turtles spawn at light levels greater than 8, on sand blocks less than 4 blocks above sea level.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, turtles spawn in groups of 2\u20136, at light level 7 or higher, at Y=60\u201367.\n\nWhen turtles die, they drop: 0\u20132 seagrass.\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level

die.\n\nWhen a baby turtle grows up to an adult it drops: 1 scute Upon successful breeding, 1\u20137 is dropped.\n\nTurtles can both move around on land and swim in water.\n\nThey move slowly on land, but they can swim at a fast speed in the water.\n\nLike other passive mobs, they move around aimlessly and flee when attacked.\n\nWhen on land, they generally attempt to move to the nearest water source with direct sky access.\n\n[verify ] When in an enclosed area, such as a player-made enclosure, they generally swim in circles if the water is in the area, and rarely go on land to explore, if there is any.\n\nTurtles cannot be attached to leads, [2] but they can be led by a player holding seagrass within 10 blocks of the turtle.\n\nTurtles can be picked up by boats  [Java Edition only ] and minecarts.\n\nTurtles are killed instantly when struck by lightning.\n\nAs with other aquatic mobs, turtles suffer extra damage when hit by a trident with the Impaling enchantment, [Java Edition only ]  [until JE Edition Combat Tests ] and cannot drown, despite the fact that real-life turtles breathe air.\n\nTurtles and turtle eggs are attacked by the following mobs: Zombies and their variants deliberately trample on turtle eggs, causing them to break.\n\n\u2191 a b Unlike zombies, zombified piglins, and their variants, withers and ravagers do not intentionally break turtle eggs but are able to break turtle eggs if they are in its way.\n\nTurtles remember the block on which they hatch as their home beach.\n\nNo matter how far away the turtle is, it always attempts to return to its home beach to lay its eggs after breeding.\n\nIf the player uses a tool enchanted with Silk Touch to obtain and move turtle eggs to a new location before hatching, the baby turtles remember the new hatching location as their home beach.\n\nIf a turtle is spawned from a spawn egg, summoned with the / summon command, or spawned by mob spawners, it remembers the spawn location as its home beach.\n\nA turtle digs sand around the block on which it lays its eggs.\n\nA turtle lays eggs after digging.\n\nFeeding two turtles seagrass causes them to enter love mode, causing one of the turtles to have eggs in its inventory and appear a bit bigger (about 0.2 of a block) than normal turtles.\n\nThe pregnant turtle then travels back to its home beach, which is where it first spawned.\n\nUpon arrival, it seeks a nearby sand block on which to lay its eggs.\n\nA turtle always lays eggs within 9 blocks from where it was born.\n\nThe turtle digs vigorously while turning 360 degrees for several seconds a few times, and then lays 1\u20134 turtle eggs.\n\nTurtles have a 90-second cooldown after breeding in Bedrock Edition, and a five-minute cooldown in Java Edition.\n\nTurtle eggs can be placed on any block in clusters of up to 4, however, they hatch only on sand, red sand, or suspicious sand, above or below water.\n\nEggs can be broken without tools and can also be trampled by living entities falling or walking on them.\n\nWhen a multi-egg block is trampled, eggs are broken one at a time.\n\nA turtle can walk on the eggs without breaking them.\n\nHarvesting eggs with Silk Touch drops an egg, which the player can collect.\n\nMining an egg with Silk Touch resets the egg's growth.\n\nTurtle eggs progress toward hatching by cracking.\n\nCracking occurs during random ticks, and an egg hatches once it has cracked 3 times.\n\nWhen a multi-egg block hatches, all eggs within the block hatch simultaneously.\n\nEggs grow fastest during the night and typically take 4 to 5 in-game days to hatch.\n\nSee Turtle egg#Hatching for more details.\n\nWith a height of 0.12 blocks, baby turtles are among the smallest mobs in the game.\n\nBaby turtles are small enough that when they walk on soul sand, they are entirely within the space at the top of the block.\n\nUpon hatching, baby turtles search for the nearest water block within a 47\u00d71\u00d747 region two blocks below the turtle and attempt to approach it.\n\nBaby turtles take one Minecraft day to grow up (20 minutes).\n\nThe growth can be accelerated using seagrass.\n\nEach use reduces the remaining growth duration by

different texture.\n\nThe variant is determined by the biome they spawn in with a default pack size of 4.\n\nThe variants are: Pale wolf: The wolf variant that most players are familiar with.\n\nThis variant spawns in the taiga biome.\n\nWoods wolf: This variant spawns in the forest biome.\n\nThis is the most likely wolf variant that the player can find in the Overworld since forest biome is very common.\n\nAshen wolf: This variant spawns in the snowy taiga biome.\n\nBlack wolf: This variant spawns in the old growth pine taiga biome, in smaller packs of 2-4.\n\nChestnut wolf: This variant spawns in the old growth spruce taiga biome, in smaller packs of 2-4.\n\nRusty wolf: This variant spawns in the sparse jungle biome, in smaller packs of 2-4.\n\nSpotted wolf: This variant spawns in the savanna plateau biome, in larger packs of 4-8.\n\nStriped wolf: This variant spawns in the wooded badlands biome, in larger packs of 4-8.\n\nSnowy wolf: This variant spawns in the grove biome.\n\nThis wolf is a rare type as it doesn't spawn in a pack with other wolves.\n\nNaturally-spawned wolves are untamed and become hostile if attacked by the player.\n\nWhen summoned in other ways (e.g.\n\nusing the spawn egg or using the / summon command), the variant selection follows the natural spawning biome rules with the extensions of the fact that rusty wolf, spotted wolf, and striped wolf are selected in all jungle biomes, savanna biomes, and badlands biomes respectively.\n\nAdult wolves drop 1\u20133 experience orbs when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nA tamed wolf that is killed by its owner still drops experience.\n\nUpon successful breeding, 1\u20137 are dropped.\n\nLike other baby animals, killing a pup yields no experience.\n\nA tamed wolf \"begging\" the player for food.\n\nThree tamed wolves following the player around.\n\nWolves exhibit three different states depending on how the user interacts with them: Untamed wolves have gray fur, a drooping tail, and their eyes consist of a white pixel and a black pixel for the pupil (on each side).\n\nThey are neutral toward the player and hostile toward sheep, rabbits, foxes, baby turtles, and skeletons.\n\nThey avoid llamas, although wolves may attack a llama that spits on them.\n\nThey do not despawn, even if they are in an unloaded chunk, or 32 blocks away from the player.\n\nAngry wolves are characterized by their constant growling and fearsome appearance.\n\nWild wolves become hostile when they are either attacked by a player or mob, if not killed in one hit [1]  [JE only ], or when they see a mob they want to eat.\n\nTheir tail is held out straight, their eyes become red, their mouth is raised in a slight snarl, and they have angry eyebrows.\n\nAngry wolves are hostile only to mobs that attack them, or to the mobs they are hunting.\n\nThey can see attackers even if they are under the invisibility effect, but they cannot track the attacker down, if they get out of their render distance, or the attacker was able to unload the chunk where the wolves were.\n\nAngry wolves cannot be leashed, but a wild wolf may become angry while it is still leashed without dropping the lead.\n\nTamed wolves have friendlier-looking eyes.\n\nThey have a default red collar around their neck, which can be dyed using any color of dye on the wolf.\n\nThis also includes other wolves owned by other player, where any player can dye that wolf's collar.\n\nPressing use on the wolf makes it sit and remain in place and not follow the player around.\n\nTamed wolves that are not sitting attack players or mobs that their owner attacks, or those that injure their owner unless the target has the same owner or is on the same team.\n\nThey do not attack creepers, ghasts, tamed horses or tamed cats, regardless of owner.\n\nStanding tamed wolves attack only skeletons and their variants without provocation.\n\nTamed wolves are always passive to the player, even if the player hits them or kills a tamed wolf on the same team.\n\nA wolf becomes hostile to a player or other mob that attacks it unless the attacker is the wolf's owner, or is otherwise on the same team, or if killed in one hit [JE only ].\n\nIt also causes wild wolves and standing tamed wolves in a 33\u00d733\u00d721 cuboid centered on the attacked wolf to become hostile to the attacker, allowing coordination for attacks and team hunts (only in wild wolves).\n\nIn Java Edition, any tamed wolf attacked by a player/mob causes all standing wolves on that team to attack that player/mob who attacked the tamed wolf.\n\nIf damaged by a mob or entity other than a player or arrow, wolves of any type only take roughly half of the original damage ((damage + 1) / 2).\n\nSkeletons and their variants, foxes, baby turtles and passive rabbits actively avoid both tamed and wild wolves.\n\nKiller rabbits  [JE only ] attack wolves actively.\n\nSheep ignore wolves, but flee when attacked by one.\n\nSheep ignore tamed wolves but also do not flee from them.\n\nWhen a player within 8 blocks holds meat or bones near a wolf, the wolf tilts its head as if to 'beg' for the food for 2 to 4 seconds.\n\nThe behavior of pups is the same as tamed wolves.\n\nPups have larger heads, similar to other animal babies.\n\nWolves are 0.85 [JE only ] or 0.8 [BE only ] blocks tall and pups are 0.425 [JE only ] or 0.4 [BE only ] blocks tall.\n\nThe textures of the wolves are tinted dark gray once submerged in water.\n\nIn Peaceful difficulty, hostile wolves deal no damage to the player.\n\nA tamed wolf shaking off water.\n\nStanding tamed wolves wander randomly when near their owner, but follow if more than 10 blocks away and teleport to a nearby free block (if any) if more than 12 blocks away.\n\nBesides making travel easier, teleportation can be used to rescue them from lava, water or pits, as they immediately teleport to a safe area.\n\nWolves can be told to \"sit\" by pressing use on them and made to stand again with another press of use.\n\nA wolf automatically sits when first tamed.\n\nWhile sitting, they do not follow the player.\n\nHowever, if their owner fights a mob near them, they are still likely to join the fight.\n\nWhen the fight is over, they go back to sitting (if in water, they do not sit until they are on dry land, telling the wolf to sit makes it stand).\n\nThey sit at their new location instead of returning to wherever they were previously.\n\nWolves stand up and follow the player if it is pushed into water or injured while sitting.\n\nWolves can either attack (within 16 blocks) or flee (within 24 blocks) from llamas.\n\nThe wolves' speed is increased by 50% whereas they flee.\n\nWolves find paths to their targets if attacking within 16 blocks, even in difficult terrain.\n\nThey also navigate along the edges of cliffs and occasionally fall far enough to take damage if they leap.\n\nWolves attack their targets running about at the player's walking speed and by leaping at them in exactly the same manner as spiders, but cause no damage while in midair.\n\nTamed wolves attack any animal the player starts to attack.\n\nThey also can navigate and turn around in 1\u00d71 horizontal tunnels.\n\nAfter emerging from water, a wolf shakes the water off their fur.\n\nThis is represented by an animation and water particles.\n\nTamed wolves teleport to their owner, if they are more than 12 blocks away, with a few caveats.\n\nTeleporting resets the focus of a tamed wolf, so if a wolf is attacking a mob and teleports beside a player, it resumes following the player, as its tracking has been reset.\n\nIt is possible for tamed wolves to teleport to an inaccessible location (e.g.\n\nunder ice) and be injured or die of suffocation as a result.\n\nThis happens when the wolf considers transparent blocks, such as glass, or slabs, to be open.\n\nIt cannot teleport when it is sitting.\n\nAn angry or untamed wolf does not teleport.\n\nTamed wolves do not teleport if: The wolf has been ordered to sit.\n\n[2] Exception: The wolf is likely to teleport if it is injured while sitting (it no longer sits after teleporting).\n\nAn example is if a wolf that is sitting is hit by another player, it teleports to their owner.\n\nException: If the wolf is in a loaded chunk, and the player gets damaged by a mob, there's a chance for the wolf to stop sitting, causing them to teleport if the player is far away, then attacking the player's attacker and sitting down afterward.\n\nThe wolf is chasing after a skeleton.\n\nThis can lead to wolves standing and jumping in one place, such as over a cavern if a skeleton is near.\n\nThe wolf teleports once the skeleton is killed.\n\nThe wolf is in a minecart or a boat.\n\nThe wolf has been attached to a fence post with a lead.\n\nThe wolf is in an unloaded chunk.\n\nNone of the blocks on the edge of a 5\u00d71\u00d75 region centered on the player are transparent blocks with a solid block below and another transparent block above.\n\nThe player is in another dimension; a wolf remains in its current dimension until the player returns.\n\nHowever, wolves can be transported to another dimension by pushing them into the portal first.\n\nThe owner is not directly touching the ground (e.g.\n\nusing elytra, swimming, flying, in a boat).\n\nThe wolf is in any body of water, it may not teleport to the owner. [Bedrock Edition only ] Wolf teleportation is completely silent; this is not an oversight.\n\n[3] Many tamed wolves sitting.\n\nA group of begging wolves.\n\nA wolf can be tamed by feeding it bones.\n\nOnce tamed, a wolf does not accept any more bones.\n\nNote that the number of bones required is random \u2013 each bone has a 1 \u2044 3 chance of taming the wolf.\n\n[4] If the wolf is tamed, it receives a red collar and, in Java Edition, sits if not swimming.\n\nThere is no limit [5] to the number of wolves the player can tame.\n\nA wolf's tail rises and lowers depending on its health.\n\nThe exact health of an individual wolf can be determined by measuring the angle between its hind legs and tail.\n\nThe angle indicates the percentage of health that the wolf has.\n\nTamed wolves whine when they have low health (below 10).\n\nWild wolves have a maximum health of 8, so their tails always remain significantly lower than those of tamed wolves.\n\nTamed wolves can be healed by feeding them any sort of meat other than fish; [Bedrock Edition only ] listed below, this restores as much of the wolf's health as the same food would restore hunger points when eaten by the player. [Bedrock Edition only ] The wolf cannot be tamed if it is hostile or already tamed.\n\nWolves that are tamed by the same player can accidentally attack each other while attacking another mob, leading to a fight.\n\nWolves do not get food poisoning, so they can freely eat rotten flesh, pufferfish or raw chicken.\n\nFeeding a tamed wolf that is already at full health usually starts the \" love mode \" animation.\n\nA tamed wolf's necklace/collar color can be changed by using a dye on the wolf.\n\nMain article: Breeding A pup sitting.\n\nTamed wolves at full health can be bred with any type of meat, including rotten flesh and raw chicken without causing the hunger status effect.\n\nThere is a 5-minute cooldown for breeding, during which the wolf does not accept meat.\n\nThe growth of pups can be slowly accelerated using any type of meat.\n\nEach use takes 10% off the remaining time to grow up.\n\nUnlike healing, rabbit stew or any type of fish cannot be used for breeding or speeding up growth.\n\nBreeding two wolves that recognize someone else as an owner causes the pup to also be owned by the owner of the original two wolves.\n\nIf two tamed wolves have different owners, their pups will randomly follow one of their two owners.\n\nIf the player attacks an untamed wolf and then feeds it, hearts appear as when entering breeding mode, although the wolf does not breed and remains aggressive toward the player.\n\nJava Edition: Wolves use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b MC-177522 \u2191 a b MC-177094 Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Wolves have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Additional fields for mobs that can become angry Additional fields for mobs that can be tamed by players Additional fields for mobs that can breed Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs CollarColor: The color of the wolf's collar.\n\nPresent even for wild wolves (but does not render); default value is 14.\n\nMain article: Wolf/DV [edit ] Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nWolves when they were in development uploaded by Jeb as shown below.\n\nThe first screenshot of wolves.\n\n[11] The second screenshot of wolves.\n\nHere, Jeb implemented sitting and has a new texture.\n\n[12] Issues relating to \"Wolf\", \"Wolves\", or \"Dog\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nIf a tamed wolf is named with a name tag, its name is shown in the chat to the owner when killed.\n\nWolves can teleport into transparent blocks.\n\nIn singleplayer, if the player punches a wild wolf and leaves its field of vision, it stares at the player and does not move at all.\n\nGoing back into its range causes it to continue pursuing the player.\n\nA hostile wolf can path-find like most mobs, but may sometimes try to jump across a 1\u20132 block gap to get to a player.\n\nA wolf cannot scale a two-block gap, so it falls, but may still manage to damage the player.\n\nUntamed wolves use their hostile appearance when they are attacking sheep, skeletons, foxes, baby turtles or rabbits.\n\nThey change back once the targeted mob dies or gets out of their range.\n\nAttacking a wild wolf in Peaceful Mode aggravates the wolf and its group, but they do no damage.\n\nA wild pup's head grows significantly when attacked.\n\nIf the player attacks a wolf, but then moves a large distance away (e.g.\n\n70 blocks), the wolf still appears hostile, but exhibits neutral behavior. [Java Edition only ] Wolves chase bats despite being unable to reach them.\n\n[13] In Bedrock Edition, a glitched adult \"red wolf\" can be spawned using the command / summon wolf ~ ~ ~ minecraft:on_tame, and a \"red pup\" can be spawned with / summon wolf ~ ~ ~ minecraft:entity_born.\n\nThe wolf cannot be tamed, bred or fed, though its model color can be altered by using various dyes.\n\nA tamed version of this \"red wolf\" can be obtained by taming it as soon as it becomes hostile toward a mob such as a skeleton.\n\nA tamed wolf tilts its head toward the player when the player is holding bones, despite it no longer being able to accept bones.\n\nIf a player uses the / effect command to give a tamed wolf with max health health boost 255, absorption 255 and Regeneration 255, the tamed wolf\u2019s tail may begin spinning all the way around constantly, or it just points directly up.\n\nIn Legacy Console Edition tutorial worlds wolf spawn eggs can be found Show all renders Angry wolf Sitting wolf Sitting angry wolf Pup Angry pup Sitting pup Sitting angry pup A tamed wolf shaking off water droplets after a swim.\n\nA hostile wolf shaking off water droplets after a swim.\n\nWolves having a darker texture when they are swimming or when it's raining.\n\nTamed wolves with dyed collars.\n\nA tamed pup.\n\nA wild pup.\n\nAn adult wolf fighting a pup.\n\nA wolf killing a sheep.\n\nA hostile wolf looking and running at the player.\n\nA wolf and a cat sitting on carpet.\n\nTwo tamed adult wolves and a pup.\n\nTwo wolves sitting in a boat.\n\nWolves in the three main biomes where they are found.\n\nTamed wolves attacking a pig.\n\nA wolf named Dinnerbone.\n\nAnother wolf named Dinnerbone (with Dinnerbone).\n\nA wolf with a blue collar.\n\nSunny from the perspective of a wolf.\n\n[14] Steve and Alex with a Wolf.\n\nOfficial tamed wolf artwork.\n\nTamed wolf art.\n\nA tamed wolf in official artwork for The Wild Update.\n\nKai walking their tamed wolf in a Cherry Grove.\n\nKai crafting cherry planks besides their pet wolf.\n\nKai\u2019s pet wolf thinking of a cherry doghouse.\n\nBlocco, a uniquely colored wolf featured in Minecraft Story Mode.\n\nLego Minecraft tamed wolf.\n\nOfficial T-shirt artwork Owner of the Sphere made by JINX.\n\nMinecraft Jolly Mobs Wolf, an official T-Shirt design.\n\nAcid Wolf, an official T-Shirt design.\n\nTamed wolf plush made by JINX.\n\nTamed pup plush made by JINX.\n\nAn officially licensed wolf mug.\n\nAn officially licensed wolf jar.\n\nAn officially licensed wolf bowl.\n\nPromotional image for a collaboration with PUMA.\n\nOfficial Artwork for the Tricky Trials update, featuring the wolf.\n\n\u2191 MC-2432 \u2014 \"Pack of wild Wolves / Zombified piglins / Silverfish / Bees not becoming aggressive at one hit kill\" \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 \" No, but they can teleport =)\" \u2013 @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X, March 30, 2011 \u2191 MC-166291 \u2191 \"No it's random\" \u2013 @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X, March 18, 2011 \u2191 \"We haven't decided how to limit the amount of wolves yet, currently it's unlimited\" \u2013 @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X, March 18, 2011 \u2191 \"Wolves whimper in SMP because I accidentally used the client-side health value instead of the synched one\" \u2013 @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X, April 1, 2011 \u2191 \"Nope, but they have dyable collars instead!\" \u2013 @Dinnerbone (Nathan Adams) on X, August 17, 2012 \u2191 MC-54109 \u2191 MC-199350 \u2191 MC-117635 \u2191 \"Ok don't laugh, I just tried to make it white to non-bear'ify it, didn't turn out well =)\" \u2013 @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X, March 15, 2011 \u2191 \"Wolf progress (yes it knows \"SIT!\")\" \u2013 @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X, March 16, 2011 \u2191 MC-9925 \u2191 https://youtube.com/shorts/oM0efF8anO4?feature=share Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

three of them generate in each one.\n\nThree elder guardians spawn naturally during the generation of each ocean monument: one in the top room of the monument and the other two in each wing section of the monument.\n\nThey do not respawn after their initial spawn, thus there are a limited number of them per world.\n\nHowever, they may be squished to death for some reasons, reducing the number available on the monument Elder guardians drop the following items: 0\u20132 prismarine shard s \u2013 always.\n\nAffected by Looting: 1 more drop per level, for a maximum of 5.\n\n1 wet sponge \u2013 when killed by the player.\n\nNot affected by Looting.\n\n20% chance to drop a tide armor trim smithing template, unaffected by Looting.\n\nOne of the following: 1 \u2044 2 chance: a raw cod (cooked cod if killed by fire [JE only ]).\n\nAffected by Looting: 0\u20131 more drops per level, for a maximum of 4.\n\n1 \u2044 3 chance: prismarine crystals.\n\nAffected by Looting: 0\u20131 more drops per level, for a maximum of 4.\n\n1 \u2044 6 chance: no drop.\n\n2.5% chance: a random fish.\n\nAffected by Looting: 1% more chance per level, for a maximum of 5.5% with Looting III.\n\nThis drop uses the same chances that fishing uses, resulting in a 60% chance for raw cod, a 25% chance for raw salmon, a 13% chance for pufferfish, and a 2% chance for tropical fish.\n\n10 \u2013 when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nThis section would benefit from the addition of more images.\n\nPlease remove this notice once you've added suitable images to the article.\n\nThe specific instructions are: Animated images of the elder guardian cursing effect, distinct ones for java and bedrock due to animation differences Elder guardians do not swim around as much as normal guardians.\n\nElder guardians do not swim away when approached by a player it is targeting, unlike regular guardians.\n\nLike normal guardians, elder guardians attempt to attack both the player and squid.\n\nThe elder guardian's eye follows and stares at any nearby players, and always looks directly at its target.\n\nThe eye still follows a player under the effects of Invisibility or in Spectator mode, but doesn't attack.\n\nElder guardian are considered aquatic mobs, and thus are affected by the Impaling enchantment.\n\n [Java Edition only ]  [until JE Combat Tests ] The elder guardian has three methods of attacking, including firing its laser, inflicting Mining Fatigue, and a defensive thorn-like attack.\n\nThe elder guardian pathfinds toward an ocean monument if it is not within one.\n\nAn elder guardian attacks axolotls that are not playing dead.\n\nOtherwise, an elder guardian does not attack mobs (such as iron golems) that attack it, although the attacking mob takes damage from the elder guardian's natural spikes defense.\n\nLaser The laser takes several seconds to charge, doing no damage and allowing the player to move away in the meantime.\n\nAs it charges it turns from purple to bright yellow (thus acting as a warning indicator).\n\nOnce charged, the beam flashes green, abruptly ends, and deals 12 \u00d7 6 damage on Hard difficulty.\n\nThe elder guardian swims around for a few seconds before firing again.\n\nThe beam cannot be dodged and has a maximum range of approximately 14 blocks.\n\nOnce the player is out of range, if the beam is obstructed by solid blocks, or if the player has a shield, the guardian's beam disengages from the player and deals no damage.\n\n[more information needed ] In Java Edition, immediately after spawning and once each minute thereafter, the elder guardian searches for any player within a spherical radius of 50 blocks to afflict with Mining Fatigue III.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition the elder guardian inflicts any unafflicted player within range immediately.\n\nWhen afflicted, the player sees a ghostly image of the elder guardian and hears a ghostly noise.\n\nThe effect decreases a player's attack speed by 30% and decreases mining speed even more for 5 minutes.\n\nThe attack targets players through blocks, even underground, and a potion of Invisibility offers no defense.\n\nThis is not considered an attack in regards to the Thorns enchantment.\n\nThe image of the elder guardian is a particle effect that can be recreated by issuing the command / particle minecraft:elder_guardian. [Java Edition only ] An elder guardian deals 2 (3 on Hard mode) of damage every time it is hit while its spikes are extended, similar to the Thorns enchantment on armor.\n\nIf cornered by a player or axolotl, the elder guardian usually extends its spikes and fires at point-blank range.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition.\n\nThe elder guardian ghost flying.\n\nThe elder guardian ghost is an unused mob added in beta 1.13.0.4.\n\nIts file isn't included in the behavior pack, and it can be spawned only by using the command / summon elder_guardian_ghost ~ ~ ~.\n\nThe elder guardian ghost has defensive spikes.\n\nThe elder guardian ghost has the same model and texture as the elder guardian, but uses the player hurt sound, has less health, and is missing the back tail model.\n\nWhen spawned outside of water, it floats upward until it despawns, similar to a mob tied to a balloon, or under a high level of levitation effect, but it passes through blocks.\n\nThe elder guardian ghost itself isn't immune to suffocation damage, and drops only experience.\n\nIt behaves similar to custom mobs added in behavior packs with broken AI; the mobs float upward and pass through blocks when hit.\n\nIf an elder guardian ghost is spawned underwater, it slowly sinks downward, passing through all blocks (including bedrock), until it eventually it falls into the void and dies.\n\nWhen underwater, the elder guardian ghost can rotate its body, look at players, and swim while slowly sinking downward.\n\nJava Edition: Elder guardians use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 Increases quadratically from minimum to maximum as the attack goes on \u2191 Increases linearly from minimum to maximum as the attack goes on Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Elder guardians have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Elder Guardian\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe elder guardian's eye is the \"head\" part of the mob 's model, giving the illusion of a dynamic eye.\n\nThe elder guardian texture has the name \"jeb\" on it.\n\nAccording to Jeb, elder guardians were introduced to encourage players to solve the temple maze rather than dig through it easily.\n\nHe acknowledges there are ways around it, but players still have to solve the challenge in a different way.\n\n[4] Also according to Jeb, the \"jump scare\" by an elder guardian is unintentional, instead, he added it to provide a visual cue as to why players get slowed down by Mining Fatigue.\n\n[4] In Java Edition 3D Shareware v1.34, elder guardians drop blue keys.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, elder guardians make their underwater death sounds if killed on land.\n\nThey also, like guardians, don't make flopping sounds on Bedrock Edition.\n\nThe elder guardian was once referred to as a \u201cboss\u201d by Mojang.\n\nThis means depending on how you see it, it could be the third boss as well as the two official bosses.\n\nA special effect of the elder guardian, which gives Mining Fatigue III for 5 minutes.\n\nThe elder guardian's Mining Fatigue effect.\n\nAn elder guardian spawned inside an ocean monument.\n\nAn elder guardian spreading its spikes.\n\nAn elder guardian's laser.\n\nAn elder guardian in full view.\n\nThe inside of an elder guardian (spikes retracted).\n\nSize comparison between an elder and a normal guardian.\n\nThe elder guardian curse ghastly image shows the elder guardian's full model.\n\nA group of axolotls attacking an elder guardian.\n\nA player avoiding an elder guardian by using the Invisibility effect.\n\nA player avoiding an elder guardian by using the Invisibility effect.\n\nAn elder guardian in promotional artwork for the Boss Update.\n\nMinecraft Mobestiary 's page about elder guardians.\n\nLego Minecraft elder guardian.\n\nNarrator and MARILLA attempting to battle an Elder Guardian.\n\n\u2191 MC-57057 \u2014 Guardian laser attack sound ignores distance \u2191 MC-92294 \u2191 http://www.mojang.com/2016/08/sneak-peek-boss-update-is-coming-to-pocket-and-windows-10/ [dead link ] \u2191 a b https://minecraft.net/en-us/article/block-week-prismarine Meet the Elder Guardian \u2013 Minecraft.net on November 6, 2017 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

[JE only ] See also: Tutorials/Combat \u00a7 Guardians Guardians have two methods of attack: a laser and a defensive attack analogous to the Thorns enchantment.\n\nUnlike most other hostile mobs, a guardian does not follow a player who moves out of sight.\n\nInstead, it simply continues swimming until the player becomes visible again to start charging its laser.\n\nGuardians attack players, axolotls, and squid.\n\nOtherwise, a guardian does not retaliate against mobs (such as iron golems) that attack it, other than damaging the attacking mob with its natural thorns defense.\n\nLaser The laser takes 2 seconds to charge, doing no damage in the meantime.\n\nIt starts out purple and fades to yellow.\n\nOnce charged, the laser flashes green and deals 6 regular damage and additional 1 magical damage on normal difficulty.\n\nThe latter bypasses armor.\n\nGuardians swim around for 3 seconds before firing again.\n\nIf the target approaches while the guardian is loading its laser, it stops firing and swims away until it is at a comfortable range, at which point it continues attacking.\n\nThe laser cannot be dodged or blocked by a shield and has a maximum range of 15 blocks.\n\nOnce the target is out of range, or if the laser is obstructed by solid blocks (including transparent blocks like glass), the guardian's laser disengages.\n\nSpikes defense Guardians deal damage each time it is hit with a melee attack while its spikes are extended, similar to the Thorns armor enchantment.\n\nIf cornered, the guardian usually extends its spikes and fires at the player, even at point-blank range.\n\nJava Edition: Guardians use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 Increases quadratically from minimum to maximum as the attack goes on \u2191 Increases linearly from minimum to maximum as the attack goes on Bedrock Edition: \u2191 MCPE-26929 Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Guardians have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nNote: This video is outdated in Java Edition, as raw fish, cooked fish and clownfish are now called raw cod, cooked cod, and tropical fish as of 1.13.\n\nIssues relating to \"Guardian\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nA guardian's eye is actually the \"head\" part of the mob 's model.\n\nThis gives the illusion of a dynamic eye.\n\nGuardians' laser-beam attacks are affected by the potion of strength, which normally affects only melee attacks.\n\nWhen placed or spawned on a slime block, guardians start bouncing and continue and each bounce higher than the last, until each bounce brings the guardian to 17 blocks height.\n\nIn the texture file for the guardian, \"jeb\" is written in the bottom right corner.\n\n[verify ] If summoned with {NoAI:1}, the guardian's eye still follows the player.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, guardians do not make the flopping sounds while on land.\n\nJeb 's Instagram mob reveal.\n\nThe inside of a guardian (with their spikes extended).\n\nA guardian's \"eye\" follows players at any position.\n\nA guardian attacking a squid.\n\nA group of guardians defending their monument.\n\nSize comparison between a guardian and its elder variant.\n\nA guardian in a boat.\n\nThe guardian texture, with \"jeb\" written in the corner.\n\nThe guardian face texture as revealed by Jeb on reddit.\n\nGuardians in promotional artwork for the Boss Update.\n\nLego Minecraft Guardian.\n\n\u2191 MC-57057 \u2014 Guardian laser attack sound ignores distance Meet the Guardian \u2013 Minecraft.net on September 25, 2017 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

[Java Edition only ] The 22 uniquely-named varieties of tropical fish in Java Edition.\n\nFrom top to bottom: Anemone, Black Tang, Blue Tang, Butterflyfish, Cichlid, Clownfish Cotton Candy Betta, Dottyback, Emperor Red Snapper, Goatfish, Moorish Idol, Ornate Butterflyfish Parrotfish, Queen Angelfish, Red Cichlid, Red Lipped Blenny, Red Snapper, Threadfin Tomato Clownfish, Triggerfish, Yellowtail Parrotfish, Yellow Tang All possible tropical fish variants.\n\nWhen tropical fish spawn in the wild, 90% of the time they appear as one of the 22 varieties seen on the right, and the other 10% of the time their patterns, size, and colors are completely random, drawn from any of 2 shapes, 6 patterns, 15 base colors, and 15 pattern colors.\n\nThe color black does not appear on any naturally-spawned tropical fish, since the eyes are usually hard to see.\n\n[3] These result in 2,700 naturally-occurring combinations.\n\nTropical fish can be summoned with black as one or both of their colors, and/or without any visible pattern, [more information needed ] though even without the pattern they can still have a pattern color, causing a further 884 possible combinations, 480 of which look the same due to the missing pattern.\n\nTropical fish do not have common varieties in Bedrock Edition.\n\nInstead, naturally spawned tropical fish have 2 spawn attempts, the first chooses one of the 21 preset variants, and the other will use randomly chosen patterns, sizes, shapes, and colors (except black) Tropical fish spawned from a spawn egg will use randomly chosen patterns, sizes, shapes, and colors (except black).\n\nBy using commands, tropical fish may be spawned as one of the 21 preset variants.\n\nTropical fish variants in buckets have names that are assigned based on their colors and type.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the names are in the name of the bucket, giving names like \"Bucket of Plum Blockfish\", \"Bucket of Sky-Orange Snooper\", or \"Bucket of Orange-Lime Dasher\".\n\nIn Java Edition, the type, and colors are displayed as item tooltips.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the following colors are renamed from their defaults when they refer to tropical fish.\n\nParentheses indicate default name and color id - see \u00a7 Entity data.\n\nSky (Light Blue; 3) Rose (Pink; 6) Silver (Light Gray; 8) Teal (Cyan; 9) Plum (Purple; 10) The base color is first, and the pattern color is next if it is different.\n\nThe fish type is determined according to the shape and pattern of the fish: Some varieties of tropical fish don't follow the normal naming system; instead, they reference real-life fish species.\n\nIn Java Edition, these unique fish are limited to the 22 common varieties.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, there are 21 uniquely-named tropical fish, though they are not all the same as in Java Edition.\n\nThese uniquely-named tropical fish aren't different from regular tropical fish in terms of design or behavior.\n\nBedrock edition does not have the Yellowtail Parrotfish.\n\nThese varieties are: \u2191 Sunstreak in Java Edition, SunStreak in Bedrock Edition.\n\nJava Edition: Tropical fish use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 The fish's momentum, with the horizontal axes' velocities multiplied by 0.2 (capped at 1.0) \u2191 a b MC-200508 Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Tropical fish have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs FromBucket: 1 or 0 (true/false) - Whether the fish had ever been released from a bucket.\n\nVariant: A 4-byte integer.\n\nThe least significant byte has a value of either 0 for a small fish, or 1 for a large fish.\n\nValues above 1 result in an invisible fish.\n\nThe next byte has a value from 0\u20135, representing the pattern on the fish.\n\nValues above 5 result in a fish with no pattern.\n\nThe next byte has a value from 0\u201315, representing the color of the fish's body.\n\nThe most significant byte has a value from 0\u201315, representing the color of the fish's pattern.\n\nMain article: Tropical Fish/DV [edit ] The fish sizes and patterns are depicted in the following table, with white body color and dark-gray pattern color.\n\nThe 22 varieties of tropical fish most commonly found throughout the world have Variant tag values from the following table, which also lists what color/shape/patterns come from that value.\n\nThe variant number is the sum of the most significant byte \u00d7 2 24 + second most significant byte \u00d7 2 16 + second least significant byte \u00d7 2 8 + least significant byte.\n\nIssues relating to \"Tropical fish\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nAn ocean with some fish visible.\n\nCod and tropical fish, along with a turtle and squid.\n\nA screenshot of tropical fish up close.\n\nSome tropical fish jumping on land.\n\nTropical Fish as shown in the Update Aquatic artwork.\n\nTropical Fish from Update Aquatic artwork.\n\nTropical Fish in promotional artwork for the first Caves & Cliffs update.\n\nTropical fish in official artwork for The Wild Update.\n\nTropical fish art.\n\nTropical fish art.\n\nTropical fish art.\n\nTropical fish art.\n\nTropical fish art.\n\nIn the texture files of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, there is a hidden texture of a clownfish mob.\n\nClownfish were food items that existed before Update Aquatic, which were replaced by Tropical Fish food items.\n\nIt is likely that clownfish were intended to become a mob before being expanded into over 2700 variants of tropical fish.\n\nCod Salmon Pufferfish \u2191 MC-212795 \u2014 Salmon & Fish mobs are not affected by Looting \u2191 MC-126819 \u2013 \"fish bouncing and suffocating on top of the cauldron which fills with water\" resolved as \"Won't Fix\" \u2191 MC-169763 Resolved as \"Works as Intended\" \u2191 MC-221656 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

Baby: Height: 0.032 Blocks Width: 0.096 Blocks A turtle (in Java Edition), also known as a sea turtle (in Bedrock Edition), is a common passive mob found in beach biomes.\n\nThey are the only source of scutes, which drop from baby turtles when they mature into adults.\n\nTurtles spawn on the sand in the Overworld on beaches with daylight, but not in its snowy variant or stony shores, occasionally in small groups of up to 5 individuals.\n\n10% of turtles spawned are babies.\n\nIn Java Edition, turtles spawn at light levels greater than 8, on sand blocks less than 4 blocks above sea level.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, turtles spawn in groups of 2\u20136, at light level 7 or higher, at Y=60\u201367.\n\nWhen turtles die, they drop: 0\u20132 seagrass.\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0\u20135 with Looting III.\n\n1\u20133, if killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\n1 bowl, if killed by lightning.\n\n[1] Baby turtles do not drop anything when they die.\n\nWhen a baby turtle grows up to an adult it drops: 1 scute Upon successful breeding, 1\u20137 is dropped.\n\nTurtles can both move around on land and swim in water.\n\nThey move slowly on land, but they can swim at a fast speed in the water.\n\nLike other passive mobs, they move around aimlessly and flee when attacked.\n\nWhen on land, they generally attempt to move to the nearest water source with direct sky access.\n\n[verify ] When in an enclosed area, such as a player-made enclosure, they generally swim in circles if the water is in the area, and rarely go on land to explore, if there is any.\n\nTurtles cannot be attached to leads, [2] but they can be led by a player holding seagrass within 10 blocks of the turtle.\n\nTurtles can be picked up by boats  [Java Edition only ] and minecarts.\n\nTurtles are killed instantly when struck by lightning.\n\nAs with other aquatic mobs, turtles suffer extra damage when hit by a trident with the Impaling enchantment, [Java Edition only ]  [until JE Edition Combat Tests ] and cannot drown, despite the fact that real-life turtles breathe air.\n\nTurtles and turtle eggs are attacked by the following mobs: Zombies and their variants deliberately trample on turtle eggs, causing them to break.\n\n\u2191 a b Unlike zombies, zombified piglins, and their variants, withers and ravagers do not intentionally break turtle eggs but are able to break turtle eggs if they are in its way.\n\nTurtles remember the block on which they hatch as their home beach.\n\nNo matter how far away the turtle is, it always attempts to return to its home beach to lay its eggs after breeding.\n\nIf the player uses a tool enchanted with Silk Touch to obtain and move turtle eggs to a new location before hatching, the baby turtles remember the new hatching location as their home beach.\n\nIf a turtle is spawned from a spawn egg, summoned with the / summon command, or spawned by mob spawners, it remembers the spawn location as its home beach.\n\nA turtle digs sand around the block on which it lays its eggs.\n\nA turtle lays eggs after digging.\n\nFeeding two turtles seagrass causes them to enter love mode, causing one of the turtles to have eggs in its inventory and appear a bit bigger (about 0.2 of a block) than normal turtles.\n\nThe pregnant turtle then travels back to its home beach, which is where it first spawned.\n\nUpon arrival, it seeks a nearby sand block on which to lay its eggs.\n\nA turtle always lays eggs within 9 blocks from where it was born.\n\nThe turtle digs vigorously while turning 360 degrees for several seconds a few times, and then lays 1\u20134 turtle eggs.\n\nTurtles have a 90-second cooldown after breeding in Bedrock Edition, and a five-minute cooldown in Java Edition.\n\nTurtle eggs can be placed on any block in clusters of up to 4, however, they hatch only on sand, red sand, or suspicious sand, above or below water.\n\nEggs can be broken without tools and can also be trampled by living entities falling or walking on them.\n\nWhen a multi-egg block is trampled, eggs are broken one at a time.\n\nA turtle can walk on the eggs without breaking them.\n\nHarvesting eggs with Silk Touch drops an egg, which the player can collect.\n\nMining an egg with Silk Touch resets the egg's growth.\n\nTurtle eggs progress toward hatching by cracking.\n\nCracking occurs during random ticks, and an egg hatches once it has cracked 3 times.\n\nWhen a multi-egg block hatches, all eggs within the block hatch simultaneously.\n\nEggs grow fastest during the night and typically take 4 to 5 in-game days to hatch.\n\nSee Turtle egg#Hatching for more details.\n\nWith a height of 0.12 blocks, baby turtles are among the smallest mobs in the game.\n\nBaby turtles are small enough that when they walk on soul sand, they are entirely within the space at the top of the block.\n\nUpon hatching, baby turtles search for the nearest water block within a 47\u00d71\u00d747 region two blocks below the turtle and attempt to approach it.\n\nBaby turtles take one Minecraft day to grow up (20 minutes).\n\nThe growth can be accelerated using seagrass.\n\nEach use reduces the remaining growth duration by 10%.\n\nUpon becoming an adult, the turtle drops a scute.\n\nJava Edition: Turtles use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b c d e f MC-98316 \u2014

there is a 1% chance for it to increase by 2.\n\nWhen the amount reaches 5, honey can be seen dripping from the bottom and front of the hive/nest.\n\nA hive/nest must have 5 honey inside before a player can collect honeycombs or honey bottles.\n\nA bee coming out of a bee nest.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Honey farming Bees live together in colonies and take any bee nest or beehive that has enough space as their home.\n\nOne bee nest or beehive can house up to 3 bees.\n\nHomeless bees wander around, searching for empty beehives.\n\nBees can enter a beehive from any side, but exit only from the front.\n\nOne-way bee-gates can be made in this way.\n\nBees return to their nest when it rains or when it is night.\n\nThey return even when in biomes that don't rain like desert.\n\nThey stay in their nest or hive for at least 2400 game ticks (2 minutes) before coming back out.\n\nThe bees that come out keep their data (health, name, etc.).\n\nBreaking a nest or hive that contains bees releases all the bees.\n\nIf a bee nest containing bees is harvested using a tool enchanted with Silk Touch, the bees inside are kept, with their corresponding data, in the hive.\n\nThey can exit the hive again when it is placed.\n\nWhen a bee that has pollen enters and then leaves its nest or hive, the honey level of the nest or hive is increased by one.\n\nWhen the honey level of that hive reaches 5, the player can harvest it, which then sets it back to 0.\n\nBecause there is neither daylight cycle nor weather in the Nether and the End, bees work without resting in these dimensions.\n\nThis behavior is distinct from that of the villagers, which follow their daily routine according to the time in the Overworld, regardless of which dimension they are in.\n\nMain article: Damage All bees nearby are angered when an individual bee is attacked (unless the bee attacked is killed in one hit [Java Edition only ]), honey or honeycombs are collected (unless a campfire is placed under the nest), or a beehive is destroyed.\n\nHitting or walking on a nest does not anger bees; it must be destroyed to anger them.\n\nWhen destroyed, a beehive releases any bees that it contained, and the bees will be angry.\n\nIf the beehive is destroyed with a Silk Touch tool, bees outside the hive become angry  [Bedrock Edition only ], [8] while those kept within it remain neutral even after the hive is placed again.\n\nThe Invisibility effect does not cause stingers in stung players to disappear.\n\nBees attack and swarm the player as a group when angered, and the eyes of angered bees turn blood red.\n\nCollecting a honeycomb or a honey bottle from a nest or hive causes the bees that are currently in that nest or hive to leave and swarm the player unless a campfire is placed below the hive.\n\nBees attack only once, similarly to llamas and non-aggressive pandas.\n\nBees do not deal any damage in Peaceful difficulty.\n\nIf the player deflects a bee's attack with a shield, the bee continues attacking until it succeeds in hitting the player.\n\nWhen a bee's attack on a player succeeds, the player is poisoned.\n\nA bee loses its stinger after a successful attack, cannot attack further, and dies approximately one minute later.\n\nThis can be delayed with potions (Regeneration / Resistance / Absorption) that have a 255 potency.\n\nIt is possible to (quickly) breed at least one angered bee with another, even if it or they had stung and lost the stinger.\n\nHowever, they remain angered and still die later due to having lost their stingers.\n\nBees also swarm and attack other mobs when damaged; for example, if a skeleton accidentally shoots a bee.\n\nBees become neutral if they fail to land a hit on their target within 25 seconds.\n\nThe stinging animation; the bee can remain upside down for longer periods of time if a distance is kept.\n\nPrior to stinging After stinging In Java Edition, a bee's stinger is visible on the player as a small black dot after the bee successfully attacked.\n\nMain article: Honey Block Bees attach themselves to honey blocks, as if they are \"eating\" the block.\n\nMain article: Breeding Bees follow players holding flowers, flowering azalea, cherry leaves, flowering azalea leaves and mangrove propagule.\n\nIf the player is standing still and being followed by bees, the bees go toward the player, face the player, and rest on the ground.\n\nThey do this until the player moves.\n\nIf bees are given a flower, they enter love mode and pair up to create baby bees, granting the player 1-7 experience.\n\nThe parent bees have a cooldown of 5 minutes (6000 ticks) before they can breed again.\n\nBabies take 20 minutes (1 in-game day) to grow up.\n\nThe growth of baby bees can be accelerated using flowers; each use reduces the remaining time by 10%.\n\nHowever, bees' growth timer and breeding cooldowns are frozen while working in a hive; thus, when rapidly growing a population, it may be desirable to temporarily remove the hives.\n\nAny of the 1- or 2-block flowers can be used for breeding, including the wither rose, [9] even though it usually harms bees that touch it.\n\nJava Edition: Bees use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 loop1 and 2 are multiplied by 0.6;

[Bedrock Edition only ] A spider jockey can also be spawned by the command / summon spider ~ ~ ~ {Passengers: [{id:skeleton}]}.\n\nThe spider controls how both mobs move.\n\nThe spider acts like a normal spider and the skeleton acts like a normal skeleton, except its movement is determined by the spider it rides upon.\n\nThe skeleton's arrows can sometimes damage the spider jockey itself, if the spider happens to be in the way of the shot.\n\nUpon death, a spider drops up to two string s.\n\nThe maximum is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for 0 to 5 strings with Looting III.\n\n5 experience orbs are dropped by a spider when it is killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nThere is also a 1 \u2044 3 chance of dropping a spider eye when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nThe maximum amount of spider eyes is increased by 1 per level of Looting.\n\nThe chance of a spider not dropping any spider eyes can be found using the formula 2 / (Looting Level + 3).\n\nFor example, Looting III gives a 1 \u2044 3 chance of not dropping any spider eyes.\n\nA spider stays hostile toward the player and an iron golem as long as the light level immediately around the spider is 11 or less; otherwise, it does not attack unless attacked first.\n\nHostile spiders see up to 16 blocks, continuing to chase even when exposed to well-lit locations.\n\nIf a spider sustains damage from a source other than a direct attack, such as falling, its hostility resets to a neutral state.\n\nIf shot with arrows when outside of the detection range, a spider turns and runs in the direction from which the arrow was fired.\n\nIf the player moves away, the spider continues following the same path unless the player enters the detection range, in which case the spider changes direction and attacks.\n\nAn aggressive spider pounces at close range.\n\nWhen it is swimming in 1-block-deep water it pounces upon touching the submerged floor.\n\nThey can attack when their Y-axis position is changed, biting in mid-air.\n\nSpiders can climb up over solid blocks that are not magma blocks  [Bedrock Edition only ], but do not climb on underside surfaces.\n\nA spider pursuing a player can detect a player through blocks.\n\nIf a spider cannot find an ideal path to the player due to a wall barring the way, it approaches as close as possible to the player's position and proceeds to climb the wall vertically until it gets to the top, even if it loses its aggression toward the player.\n\nWhen a spider loses its aggression, it continues moving forward blindly for 2 seconds; this behavior causes the spider to climb up any walls in its path.\n\nWhen climbing a wall a spider may sometimes reach a corner and become stuck in a climbing status, thus losing and becoming unable to be aggravated.\n\nSpiders gravitate towards cobwebs.\n\nIf a spider tries to go through the world border, it starts climbing the world border instead. [JE only ] Spider can also climb on full boats, full boats with chests and shulkers.\n\nEven though normal spiders do not inflict the Poison status effect, they are immune to it.\n\nThey are also immune to the slowing applied to most mobs when walking through cobwebs.\n\nSpiders flip onto their backs when they die, unlike all other mobs, which land on their sides.\n\nThe Bane of Arthropods enchantment inflicts Slowness IV and deals more damage to spiders.\n\nJava Edition: Spiders use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Spiders have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nThe original spider in 0.26 SURVIVAL TEST development because Markus Persson made it black with red eyes before releasing that version.\n\nA recreation of the original brown spider texture.\n\nA spider during late alpha.\n\nImage of a giant spider shared by Jeb.\n\nIssues relating to \"Spider\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nSpiders are able to climb walls because they are programmed by Jens Bergensten to treat the sides of blocks as ladders.\n\n[9] In normal conditions, spiders actually float above the ground, but this is often not noticeable due to the difference between the player's height and a spider's height.\n\nWhen a spider wanders inside an enclosed space, it often climbs up a wall until reaching the ceiling, after which it become stuck, unable to exit the climbing state even if it is attacked or becomes hostile to the player.\n\n[10] Hurt sound of spiders have the same sound as when a spider is ambient A spider.\n\nA spider spawning on a single block.\n\nWith the same amount of space given, these spiders can spawn under the bottom slabs, but not under the glass blocks, because glass is a full block, even though it is transparent, but slabs are not full blocks.\n\nA spider jockey.\n\nSpiders are one of the most visible mobs at night due to their glowing red eyes.\n\nSpiders climbing.\n\nA view of a spider from below.\n\nSpider shot by a skeleton.\n\nA spider and its monster spawner in a monster room.\n\nA spider in a 1.5\u00d71.5 space.\n\nA spider's vision when spectating it.\n\nThe bottom of a ravine through a spider's eyes.\n\nSpiders can even climb soul sand.\n\nA spider climbing a wall.\n\nA spider jockey spawning with skeleton's head in the glass.\n\nA spider with invisibility during the night.\n\nAnother spider with invisibility during the night.\n\nA spider with the swiftness effect.\n\nA spider with the strengh effect.\n\nA spider with the regenertion effect.\n\nA spider with the invisibility effect.\n\nSpiders in promotional artwork for the second Caves & Cliffs update.\n\nA spider artwork.\n\nA spider artwork.\n\nA spider artwork.\n\nA spider artwork.\n\nLEGO Minecraft Spider.\n\nThe spider plush made by JINX.\n\n\u2191 MCPE-94878 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 MC-188079 \u2191 http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=6273.msg276501#msg276501 \u2191 \"Changed so that wolves and spiders don't make step sounds, and don't destroy crops when they walk on them\" \u2013 @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X, March 30, 2011 \u2191 \"@C418 Sure, if you think it would be better\" \u2013 @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X, March 30, 2011 \u2191 MC-259637 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 MCPE-15 \u2014 resolved as \"Duplicate\".\n\n\u2191 MCPE-4736 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 \"(Official) Minecraft: The Story of Mojang (Pt.\n\n2/2) - Proof of Concept for Feature-Length\" \u2191 MC-154160 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

[Java Edition only ] She cannot be damaged at just any spot in this large volume: eight green sub- hitboxes are also shown, which indicate the locations where the dragon can take damage: The tail, body, head, and wings.\n\nThe ender dragon is a flying mob, which cannot actually stand on the ground.\n\nShe flies around the end main island while fighting the player.\n\nThe dragon can pass through all blocks, destroying almost all types, but can still be affected by flowing water, lava and bubble column.\n\nBlocks not destroyed are those that naturally generate on the central End island and those that are intended to be indestructible, such as end stone and respawn anchors: Barrier Bedrock Command Block Crying Obsidian End stone End portal (block) End portal frame End gateway (block) Fire Iron bars Light Block Obsidian Reinforced Deepslate Respawn Anchor Structure Block In Java Edition, these blocks are marked under the dragon_immune tag, with the exception of light blocks and fire, which are marked as dragon_transparent.\n\nDestroyed blocks are not dropped, although containers (such as chests and dispensers, but not shulker boxes) drop their contents.\n\nThe dragon \"bathing\" endermen with its toxic breath attack.\n\nThe dragon never targets any entity but the player, although other mobs may turn hostile to the dragon when hit, and the dragon may sometimes retaliate against other mobs if it takes damage to a projectile.\n\nAny entities hit by her wings are dealt 5 damage (or 10 damage if hit by her head), and in Java Edition, are thrown into the air, sometimes to fatal heights or even off the island.\n\nNeither of these effects is applied for 1 \u2044 2 second after the dragon takes damage.\n\nThe ender dragon has four main states of behavior: Guarding The dragon begins in this state, circling the ring of obsidian pillars on either the outside if there are still end crystals or the inside if the crystals are destroyed.\n\nWith each crystal's destruction, she takes damage and there is an increased chance of the dragon switching states.\n\nTargeting Whenever the dragon finds herself less than 10 blocks or more than 150 blocks from her current target, she attempts to choose a new target.\n\nWhen damaged she targets a point just behind herself, causing her to turn away and choose a new target.\n\nStrafing Upon the destruction of an end crystal, the dragon switches to strafing.\n\nAs soon as it is within 64 blocks, she shoots a fireball at the player.\n\nThe dragon resumes circling after this state.\n\nDiving The dragon dives onto the target player's position, taken at the start of the dive.\n\nThe dragon resumes circling after this state, whether or not she actually hit the player.\n\nPerching While Guarding and the dragon has reached the end of the path, she has 1 in (3 + crystals alive) chance (~7.7% up to 33%) to go to the exit portal structure (approaching from the side opposite the player if possible) and lands on the highest block of the coordinates (x=0, z=0), up to (y=101). [Bedrock Edition only ] If there is no block in (x=0, z=0) the dragon freezes right when she switches to perching. [Bedrock Edition only ] The dragon is immune to arrows in this state; they all catch fire and bounce off.\n\nIn Java Edition she is also immune to thrown tridents in this state.\n\nDragon's Breath Unless the player is in Peaceful difficulty, after 1.25 seconds, if a player is within 20 blocks of the exit portal structure, the dragon roars and use its 3-second breath attack, damaging players similarly to a lingering potion of Harming.\n\nAn area of visible particles in the shape of a horizontal disc one block tall and 5 to 6 blocks in diameter appears where the breath attack strikes, either on the ground or floating in the air, at whatever point the breath attack struck a block.\n\nThe harming effect zone where the player takes damage is confined to a smaller area in the center this visible cloud, covering about 3 to 4 blocks.\n\nThe harming effect portion of the purple clouds emitted from the dragon's breath attack can be collected in a glass bottle to obtain dragon's breath.\n\nEach bottle of dragon's breath collected removes one block from the lingering damage zone of the breath attack.\n\nThe visible clouds remain for 3 seconds whether the dragons breath is bottled or not.\n\nBy rapidly collecting all of the harmful blocks, usually around three, even a direct hit from the breath attack can be mostly and even entirely negated before the player suffers any damage.\n\nCharge If the player is not near the portal within 5 seconds of the dragon's landing, it charges at players within 150 blocks.\n\nTake-off After four consecutive breath attacks, or if the dragon fails to locate a player within 150 blocks, she takes off from her perch.\n\nShe always takes off in Peaceful difficulty, making it difficult to land melee hits.\n\nThe dragon resumes circling after this state.\n\nEscape If cumulative damage taken while perched exceeds 50 \u00d7 25, the dragon takes off and resets the damage accumulator.\n\nThe accumulator is not reset if she does not take enough damage.\n\nThe dragon resumes circling after this state.\n\nIn Java Edition, when the dragon finally takes a fatal blow, she flies toward the exit portal structure before dying, unless she cannot find it within 150 blocks, or it is inside blocks.\n\nDragon Fireball Dragon Fireball (JE) Dragon Fireball (BE) Behavior Does not exist Details Size Height: 1 Block Width: 1 Block Dragon fireballs are special fireballs that the ender dragon fires while strafing.\n\nThey cannot be deflected unlike ghast fireballs, and they do no impact damage.\n\nInstead, they deposit purple effect clouds across the ground that damages players the same way a lingering potion of Harming does.\n\nThis means that the ender dragon's fireballs deal magic damage, which ignores any damage reduction that comes from the player's armor.\n\nHowever its damage does get reduced by armor enchanted with the Protection enchantment.\n\nThe purple effect cloud's hitbox slowly grows larger in diameter until it disappears.\n\nAs with her close-ranged breath attack, the purple clouds can be bottled to obtain the dragon's breath.\n\nUnlike lingering potions of Harming, the effect cloud does not shrink when affecting mobs.\n\nJava Edition: Ender dragons use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nDragon fireballs use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 While the pillars are preparing to be resummoned, it occurs at 0 seconds, 2.5\u20132.6 seconds, and 4.75\u20135 seconds.\n\nWhen the ender dragon is about to be summoned, it occurs 5\u20134.75 seconds before and 2\u20130 seconds before.\n\n\u2191 Does not trigger at all if the gamerule globalSoundEvents is false Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock

landed state), 5=landed, performing breath attack, 6=landed, looking for a player for breath attack, 7=landed, roar before beginning breath attack, 8=charging player, 9=flying to portal to die, 10=hovering with no AI (default when using the / summon command).\n\nDragon fireballs have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nEntity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all fireballs Tags common to all projectiles A dragon fireball spawned by a command (left) and the damage and the explosion it caused (right).\n\nThe / summon ender_dragon command, by default, summons a harmless ender dragon that hovers in place  [JE only ].\n\nSetting the DragonPhase tag (by issuing either the / summon ender_dragon ~ ~ ~ {DragonPhase:0} or the / data merge entity <selector> {DragonPhase:0} commands) starts the ender dragon's ordinary behavior, although the health bar does not appear because it is managed by the ender dragon fight status rather than by the dragon entity itself  [JE only ].\n\nIf spawned away from the center of the map (x=0, z=0), it flies to the center then resumes normal behavior (see #Behavior).\n\nTarget selectors for the ender dragon target a total of 9 entities per dragon, as the ender dragon actually consists of 9 entities internally [Java Edition only ].\n\nSo executing at a dragon to summon an arrow summons 9 arrows.\n\nThis section would benefit from the addition of more images.\n\nPlease remove this notice once you've added suitable images to the article.\n\nThe specific instructions are: Ender dragon

The Void does not affect ender dragons.\n\nIf low enough on health, the ender dragon emits beams of light without dying, as if cracked.\n\nName tags cannot be used on an ender dragon.\n\nThe ender dragon's hitbox, especially her wings, is unexpected larger than the ender dragon itself, causing players to be pushed away from her from farther away than usual.\n\nIf the player kills a summoned dragon in the Overworld or Nether, it does not create a portal or an egg.\n\nIn Spectator mode, the player cannot view the perspective of the ender dragon, unlike any other mob.\n\nHowever, it is possible through the use of commands (like / spectate).\n\nWhen this happens, the player's camera appears about 1 block over the dragon's body.\n\nUsing F3 + B  [JE only ] to show hitboxes reveals that the ender dragon's head rotation faces in the opposite direction to where its real head faces.\n\nThis is also why the ender dragon faces the wrong way when set in a monster spawner.\n\nWhen an ender dragon is spawned in the Overworld, it flies to coordinates X=0 and Z=0 and dives at the ground or does the same behavior as if in the End.\n\nIf end crystals are placed in the Overworld, they heal the dragon as normal, but it does not perch anywhere, and continues to fly around forever.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, there is an unused texture file for a dragon fireball item.\n\nIn Super Smash Bros.\n\nUltimate, one of the spirits that comes with the Steve/Alex DLC is the ender dragon.\n\nIt appears as a Legend-class \"spirit\" that makes the user breathe fire for a long time at the start of each battle.\n\nA wither that is summoned to battle the ender dragon cannot deal damage because the ender dragon flies too fast, and she is immune to projectiles when perching.\n\nIf commands or Creative mode are used to get end portal frames and eyes of ender, a player can basically skip to the end poem.\n\nIf a player destroys ender crystals or even hurts the dragon and then uses a player-made portal, upon returning, the player retains their progress. [BE only ] The end dragon has the longest death sound She is clearly biologically female because she can lay eggs.\n\n(It\u2019s best not to think about this too much with chickens and cows) On Reddit, Notch suggested the ender dragon's name to be \"Jean?\" in the same manner he called the player \"Steve?\".\n\n[6] Dinnerbone later stated that he thinks the name is officially \"Jean?\".\n\n[7] Despite this, an article on Minecraft.net states that \"uttering its true name would unleash a destructive force that would obliterate not only the End, but the Nether and the Overworld at the same time.\" [8] Notch referred to the ender dragon as a she on Reddit [citation needed ], the Xbox avatar item Ender Dragon Pet has the description \"A cuter, friendlier version of his bigger, less playful Minecraft sister,\" and the encyclopedia in Bedrock Edition refers to the dragon with feminine pronouns.\n\nhowever, it has been later confirmed by Notch, [9] Brandon Pearce [10] and Jeb [11] that all mobs in Minecraft have no gender, which would include ender dragon unless they don\u2019t count bosses.\n\nBefore she was textured, Notch reported that he was afraid to texture the ender dragon as she was a complicated model.\n\n[12] In the end, the dragon model was so complex Notch stated that he gave up making the texture manually and wrote a texture packer tool to aid him in adding the texture to the model.\n\nNotch also uploaded the code for the tool so others could use the pack.\n\n(Link to the texture packer) [13] Notch joked about how Minecraft was \"going next-gen\" when deadmau5 mentioned this.\n\n[14] Notch has uploaded a video showing why ender dragons do not spawn in the main world, as they would destroy any block they touch.\n\n[15] On Reddit, Notch explained that ender dragons destroy Overworld matter because \"trying to make an AI to properly navigate arbitrary terrain before the code freeze next tuesday [sic ] isn't feasible\".\n\n[16]

freezing.\n\nLike other undead mobs, the wither is harmed by the Instant Health effect and healed by the Instant Damage effect as well as affected by weapons with the Smite enchantment.\n\nIt is immune to all other status effects, like the ender dragon.\n\nUpon taking damage, the wither breaks all blocks within a 3\u00d74\u00d73 area around it, including blast-resistant blocks like obsidian, crying obsidian, and ancient debris, dropping them as items if possible.\n\nThe wither is the only mob in the game that can destroy obsidian.\n\nThe wither cannot break the following blocks: Barrier Bedrock End Portal End Portal Frame End Gateway Command Block Structure Block Jigsaw Block Light Block Moving Piston Moving Block  [Bedrock Edition only ] Reinforced Deepslate In Java Edition, these blocks are listed under the wither_immune tag.\n\nThe wither attacking a villager.\n\nThe wither's block-breaking behavior makes suffocation ineffective under most circumstances.\n\nHowever, the blocks listed above, as well as some natural structures that include them, can be used to suffocate the wither due to their wither immunity.\n\nThe wither is hostile toward all mobs except: Undead mobs Zombies and their variants Skeletons and their variants Zombified piglin s Skeleton horse s and zombie horse s Phantom Zoglin Other withers Ghast s [2] Mobs with the Invulnerable NBT tag.\n\nIf the wither is idle, it simply hovers and is unable to gain altitude.\n\nOn Normal or Hard difficulty, it fires blue skulls in random directions until it finds a target.\n\nThe wither's boss health bar color depends on the edition: Dark purple on Java Edition, or pink on Bedrock Edition.\n\nIt appears only when a player is looking in the wither's direction, including through walls.\n\nAll withers display a boss bar on the screen.\n\nRenamed withers display the changed name above its boss bar.\n\nThe sky darkens when the wither spawns (a kind of fog).\n\nWither with 'wither armor' effect, after half health depleted.\n\nUpon noticing a mob, the wither hovers above it and rapidly shoots black wither skulls.\n\nEach head fires independently, allowing a wither to attack up to three different mobs/ players at the same time.\n\nThe main head controls the wither's movement and has a 0.1% chance to shoot a blue wither skull instead of the default black one.\n\nWhenever a wither kills another mob, a wither rose is planted if the ground is grass block, dirt, coarse dirt, moss block, mud, netherrack, soul sand, or soul soil on Java Edition, or otherwise dropped as an item at that mob's location; however, it may be destroyed by other wither skulls.\n\nWither roses are planted/dropped even when the game rule doMobLoot is set to false.\n\n[3] The wither has a passive regeneration rate of 1 every 20 ticks (1 second), and a direct killing blow on a target instantly heals 5.\n\nWhen its health drops below half (150 \u00d7 75), the wither gains a natural \"wither armor\" effect, which makes it immune to damage from arrows and thrown tridents and causes it to fly at the same height as the target.\n\nThe armor disappears if it regenerates above half health.\n\nUpon noticing a player or mob, the wither flies to a random location and hovers in place.\n\nIt shoots 3 black wither skulls and one blue wither skull before flying to another location.\n\nThe time between each shot decreases as the wither loses health.\n\nOn Normal difficulty or higher, if the wither has targeted an entity but cannot find a location to pathfind to, it shoots random blue skulls in a random direction along with the skulls directed toward the target.\n\nWhen a wither reaches halfway of its total health, it causes a large explosion that spawns 3 wither skeletons (except on Easy difficulty), as well as gaining wither armor.\n\nInstead of flying to a random location, it dashes toward its target, destroying blocks and damaging mobs in its path.\n\nIt also fires up to 4 skulls per burst: three black skulls followed by one blue skull.\n\nIt has different spawn and death animations, both of which involve the wither exploding.\n\nWither roses always drop as an item when the wither kills a mob.\n\nWither roses are dropped even when the game rule doMobLoot is set to false.\n\n[4] The wither rose inflicts the Wither effect for a couple of seconds when stepped on.\n\nThe sky light level drops to 11 and dark clouds appear from the moment the wither spawns until it is dead, preventing zombies, skeletons, and drowned from burning in sunlight.\n\nOn Easy difficulty, the wither does not inflict the wither effect or summon wither skeletons.\n\nWithers will retain their anti-projectile armor after healing it over 1/2 of its total HP (301 \u00d7 150.5), though it disappears after the game is restarted.\n\n[5] Not to be confused with Wither Skeleton Skull.\n\nWither Skull Normal Dangerous Behavior Does not exist Details Size Height: 0.3125 Blocks Width: 0.3125 Blocks When attacking, the wither rapidly fires explosive projectiles called wither skulls, which look like its own heads, at its target.\n\nThere are two types of wither skulls: a fast-moving black one, and a slower blue one.\n\nBlack wither skulls explode with a blast power of 1, the same as a ghast 's fireball, and cannot break blocks with a blast resistance above 4.\n\nBlue wither skulls have the same explosion strength, but move slower and are more destructive to terrain.\n\nBlue wither skulls break all breakable blocks (including obsidian, ancient debris, and blocks of netherite), but cannot break unbreakable blocks like bedrock, end portal frames, and reinforced deepslate.\n\nIn Minecraft Education, blue wither skulls deal increased damage, but with the same explosion radius.\n\nIf either type of wither skull hits a player or mob, it does 8 damage on Normal difficulty.\n\nIt also inflicts Wither II for 10 seconds on Normal difficulty and 40 seconds on Hard, which turns the player's hearts black () and drains health, similarly to Poison.\n\nHowever, unlike Poison, it can kill the player.\n\nLike other status effects, the Wither effect can be cured by drinking milk.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition and Legacy Console Edition, the blue skull can be deflected by hitting it with an empty hand, weapon, tool, or throwable projectiles such as tridents, arrows, snowballs, and throwable potions.\n\nJava Edition: Withers use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nWither skulls use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 MC-212623 \u2191 Does not trigger at all if the gamerule globalSoundEvents is false \u2191 MC-177741 Bedrock Edition: \u2191 Is normally 1.0, but can be 0.75

Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Wither\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe painting depicting how to spawn a wither According to Jeb, the wither was inspired by Terraria, which has a summonable boss mechanic.\n\nThe name itself is inspired by a poison spell in another game made by Jeb called Whispers in Akarra.\n\n[10] There is a painting showing the soul sand and wither skeleton skull formation needed to spawn a wither.\n\nIf the wither is damaged by the Void, it frantically attempts to fire blue skulls.\n\nAbove half health, the wither always attempts to stay a few blocks above the mob it is targeting.\n\nThis means that attempting to build or climb up to hit the wither using a sword is essentially impossible.\n\nIf the wither is after a blaze and the blaze tries to fly up to it, the wither attempts to keep rising above the blaze, thus making both of them rise higher until they hit a ceiling or until the blaze despawns or dies.\n\nAlthough the wither is 3.5 blocks tall, 3 blocks wide, and 1 block thick, its hitbox is only 3.5 blocks tall, 1 block wide, and 1 block thick.\n\nThe true dimensions of the wither are: 2.844 blocks tall (varies), 3 blocks wide, and 1.719 blocks long (also varies).\n\nThe wither appears on the four sides of chiseled red sandstone.\n\nThe wither's smaller heads shoot targets slightly slower than the main head.\n\nThe interval for smaller heads is 2\u20133 seconds, while the main head's always 2.\n\nAn enemy called the wither storm appears in Minecraft: Story Mode.\n\nIt was created by replacing the center block of soul sand with a command block.\n\nDespite not having visible feet, withers are still capable of making footstep sounds.\n\n[11] In Java Edition 3D Shareware v1.34, withers drop red keys.\n\nAccording to Quinn Richter, Marketplace Partner Manager, the wither's name is \"Simmons?\", similar to the ender dragon's name being \"Jean?\".\n\n[12] A wither skull can be deflected by shooting an arrow at it. [Bedrock Edition only ] If a deflected wither skull hits the wither, the wither takes damage. [Bedrock Edition only ] A wither and an ender dragon can engage in combat, but neither one damages the other.\n\nDespite being immune to projectiles when it has \"wither armor\", it is still able to be hit by the warden 's sonic boom attack.\n\nThis is because the warden's sonic boom attack is not a projectile, but an instant damage attack.\n\nTherefore, the wither is unable to defend against it with the \"armor\".\n\nThe withering effect after being damaged by a wither skull.\n\nThe \"wither armor\" that blocks arrows.\n\nThe wither and its armor.\n\nA larger image to show how to summon the wither.\n\nThe wither prepares for explosion with the invulnerable status after summoned.\n\nThe pit created after the wither has charged.\n\nThe wither attacking horses.\n\nThe wither's texture.\n\nWither attacking a sheep.\n\nWither attacking a village.\n\nA wither summoning setup.\n\nImage from Dinnerbone of a wither being built horizontally.\n\nA player avoiding a wither by using the Invisibility effect.\n\nFirst image of a wither being built in Bedrock Edition.\n\nWither in promotional artwork for the Pretty Scary Update.\n\nWither Storm, a variant of Wither as it appears on Minecraft: Story Mode.\n\nWither pictured in the Mobestiary.\n\nLEGO Minecraft wither.\n\n\"Acid Wither,\" an official T-Shirt design.\n\n\"Jolly Mobs Flying Head,\" another T-Shirt design.\n\nEnder dragon, the other boss mob in Minecraft Tutorials/Defeating the wither, a tutorial explaining different tactics to fight and kill the wither \u2191 MC-177741 \u2014 Wither sounds play for all players \u2191 MC-162557 \u2014 \"Withers no longer attack ghasts\" \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 MC-154922 \u2191 MCPE-73842 \u2191 MCPE-161643 \u2013 After healing a wither boss over 1/2 HP, it still retains its anti-projectile shield \u2191 \"Minecraft 1.4 - How to Spawn Wither Mob - Mojang PAX 2012 Live @ 3:07\" \u2013 Accelerated Ideas on YouTube \u2191 http://www.twitch.tv/pax2/b/330745811 (at 3:57:47) \u2191 MC-29274 \u2191 MC-189872 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 https://minecraft.net/article/meet-wither \u2191 MC-92623 \u2191 \"Ask Mojang #4: To The Moon!\n\n@ 3:40\" \u2013 Minecraft on YouTube, November 8, 2019 Meet the Wither \u2013 Minecraft.net on February 13, 2017 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

    "content": "This page would benefit from the addition of isometric renders.\n\nPlease remove this notice once you've added suitable isometric renders to the article.\n\nThe specific instructions are: Render with the model and texture of its fused and separated forms from the game Wither Storm Behavior Hostile Spawn Built by Ivor during Endercon in S1E1 The wither storm or witherstorm is an enormous, advanced, wither -like mob that served as the main antagonist for the first four episodes of Season 1 of Minecraft: Story Mode.\n\nIt was created by Ivor through the use of the command block, three wither skeleton skulls, and soul sand.\n\nIt was destroyed by Jesse's Gang in the conclusion of the fourth episode, \"A Block and a Hard Place.\" It was programmed to follow Gabriel the Warrior 's amulet.\n\nHowever, due to some mishaps, it became out of control and unstoppable, destroying everything in the way of the amulet.\n\nHow the wither storm was built.\n\nWhen created, the wither storm appeared to be a regular wither with a command block lodged within its ribcage.\n\nThough as it began to pull in the surrounding blocks, it quickly transformed into a gigantic, black creature with long, powerful tentacles along with three heads.\n\nEach head has one purple, glowing eye and a large set of mandibles.\n\nWhen it picks up blocks to build its body, they turn into an ash-like block that is absorbed into it.\n\nThe interior is similar with the exception of purple and gray variants of the blocks or mobs it has absorbed.\n\nWhile the Wither Storm still held some of the similarities as a normal wither, it contained a few enderman-esque qualities as well.\n\nThis is likely either due to the Command Block being used to erase the ender dragon out of existence or withering being similar to the corrupted-like state the End represents.\n\nSome examples being the tractor beam being able to pull blocks and objects towards itself which can be compared to the abilities of the endermen picking up blocks.\n\nBoth are able to manipulate a block's location without tools or breaking it.\n\nThe wither storm's tractor beam and certain absorbed objects were also purple; the associated color of the End and corruption.\n\nIt also has visual similarities to heart of ender from Minecraft Dungeons which was created after Minecraft: Story Mode.\n\nAt the end of \"The Last Place You Look\", the wither storm was split into three separate entities.\n\nThey all had only one head, but later in \"A Block and a Hard Place\" each of them grew two more heads.\n\nTwo of them were quite smaller than the main larger one who also had the command block within.\n\nThe wither storm is a very powerful creature.\n\nIt gained its extraordinary capabilities with the help of the Command Block.\n\nIts powers were: Wither Skulls: In its first form, the wither storm is able to shoot wither skulls the same way the ordinary wither does.\n\nSuction: In its first form, the wither storm is able to suck only objects while it didn't had its tractor beam.\n\nFlaming Wither Skulls: The wither storm in its final form was able to shoot a stronger, flaming variation of the wither skulls that the wither and itself used to shoot, their explosions are bigger and leave fire behind.\n\nTractor Beam: The wither storm was able to a create a tractor beam from each of it's head's eyes, Wither Sickness: The wither storm had an enhanced and more deadly variation of the wither (effect) that the ordinary wither has, The enhanced wither effect was called wither sickness.\n\nIt is believed that one of the ways of being infected is being too long in the creature's tractor beam.\n\nTentacles: The wither storm has several long tentacles that it uses to attack, capture preys and to destroy blocks around to help it get to its destinations.\n\nThese tentacles were strong enough to destroy even Obsidian.\n\nDurabilty: The wither storm had an absurd durability as it was able to survive the formidi-bomb even when it was exploded into pieces due to the command block withstanding it and getting the wither storm to wake up after a while.\n\nRegeneration: All the wither storm's wounds could be easily Regenerated by absorbing objects and creatures.\n\nSplitting: After the wither storm survived the formidi-bomb, it was able to make its three separated parts gain life on their own.\n\nThe bigger main one was the one who had the command block within, after it was killed with the command block 's destruction, the other two parts also died.\n\nLimbs' generation: The wither storm has the ability to grow tentacles and additional heads during its transformation while absorbing blocks and growing larger.\n\nIn \"A Block and a Hard Place\" it is shown that the wither storm is able to grow them even inside its own body so it can protect the Command Block.\n\nOrder of the Stone's Amulet's Tracking: The wither storm is able to track the Order's amulet as long it is not in the Nether or in the End.\n\nThe list below shows the victims the wither storm has killed: Magnus the Rogue (Determinant).\n\nEllegaard the Redstone Engineer (Determinant).\n\nReuben (Indirectly and Self Sacrifice).\n\nSeveral hostile mobs.\n\nPossibly a few humans (Indirectly).\n\nUsher Killed By: Jesse Reuben (assisted) The wither storm was powered by the Command Block, so to defeat it, Jesse used an enchanted weapon (with Command Block powers) to destroy the Command Block.\n\nReuben helped by retrieving the enchanted weapon for Jesse and bringing it to them, though endangering himself in the process.\n\nThis defeated the wither storm and assured it would never reanimate back to life.\n\nThe wither storm is the first major antagonist in the series and the first antagonist to be created by a person.\n\nThe second antagonist created by a person is PAMA.\n\nAlthough it's possible PAMA was the first one to be created chronologically.\n\nIt is also the first non-human major antagonist, the second being PAMA.\n\nInside the wither storm can be found withered citizens, some of them being named characters.\n\nThey are Jens, Lydia, Otis, Owen, Schoolboy, and Reuben (human).\n\nThe wither storm cannot be built in normal Minecraft, though all of the materials needed to build one exist.\n\nThe terms \"wither storm\" and \"witherstorm\" are interchangeable; in fact, both terms were used to refer to it in Minecraft: Story Mode.\n\nThe former was used in episodes 1 and 2, and the latter was used in episodes 3, 4, and 5.\n\nWhen the wither storm's middle head mutated, its eye color changed to cyan, in contrast to its main color, purple.\n\nInterestingly, at the end of episode 1 the wither storm is seen floating in the sky as if it was a light object in water.\n\nIn \"Hero in Residence\", several posters of the wither storm are seen throughout Beacontown.\n\nThe wither storm is the first antagonist to have an antagonistic role for more than one episode, the other being Romeo.\n\nIt is also the first main antagonist with no dialogue.\n\nThe wither storm after the Formidi-Bomb is used on it.",

[Java Edition only ] She cannot be damaged at just any spot in this large volume: eight green sub- hitboxes are also shown, which indicate the locations where the dragon can take damage: The tail, body, head, and wings.\n\nThe ender dragon is a flying mob, which cannot actually stand on the ground.\n\nShe flies around the end main island while fighting the player.\n\nThe dragon can pass through all blocks, destroying almost all types, but can still be affected by flowing water, lava and bubble column.\n\nBlocks not destroyed are those that naturally generate on the central End island and those that are intended to be indestructible, such as end stone and respawn anchors: Barrier Bedrock Command Block Crying Obsidian End stone End portal (block) End portal frame End gateway (block) Fire Iron bars Light Block Obsidian Reinforced Deepslate Respawn Anchor Structure Block In Java Edition, these blocks are marked under the dragon_immune tag, with the exception of light blocks and fire, which are marked as dragon_transparent.\n\nDestroyed blocks are not dropped, although containers (such as chests and dispensers, but not shulker boxes) drop their contents.\n\nThe dragon \"bathing\" endermen with its toxic breath attack.\n\nThe dragon never targets any entity but the player, although other mobs may turn hostile to the dragon when hit, and the dragon may sometimes retaliate against other mobs if it takes damage to a projectile.\n\nAny entities hit by her wings are dealt 5 damage (or 10 damage if hit by her head), and in Java Edition, are thrown into the air, sometimes to fatal heights or even off the island.\n\nNeither of these effects is applied for 1 \u2044 2 second after the dragon takes damage.\n\nThe ender dragon has four main states of behavior: Guarding The dragon begins in this state, circling the ring of obsidian pillars on either the outside if there are still end crystals or the inside if the crystals are destroyed.\n\nWith each crystal's destruction, she takes damage and there is an increased chance of the dragon switching states.\n\nTargeting Whenever the dragon finds herself less than 10 blocks or more than 150 blocks from her current target, she attempts to choose a new target.\n\nWhen damaged she targets a point just behind herself, causing her to turn away and choose a new target.\n\nStrafing Upon the destruction of an end crystal, the dragon switches to strafing.\n\nAs soon as it is within 64 blocks, she shoots a fireball at the player.\n\nThe dragon resumes circling after this state.\n\nDiving The dragon dives onto the target player's position, taken at the start of the dive.\n\nThe dragon resumes circling after this state, whether or not she actually hit the player.\n\nPerching While Guarding and the dragon has reached the end of the path, she has 1 in (3 + crystals alive) chance (~7.7% up to 33%) to go to the exit portal structure (approaching from the side opposite the player if possible) and lands on the highest block of the coordinates (x=0, z=0), up to (y=101). [Bedrock Edition only ] If there is no block in (x=0, z=0) the dragon freezes right when she switches to perching. [Bedrock Edition only ] The dragon is immune to arrows in this state; they all catch fire and bounce off.\n\nIn Java Edition she is also immune to thrown tridents in this state.\n\nDragon's Breath Unless the player is in Peaceful difficulty, after 1.25 seconds, if a player is within 20 blocks of the exit portal structure, the dragon roars and use its 3-second breath attack, damaging players similarly to a lingering potion of Harming.\n\nAn area of visible particles in the shape of a horizontal disc one block tall and 5 to 6 blocks in diameter appears where the breath attack strikes, either on the ground or floating in the air, at whatever point the breath attack struck a block.\n\nThe harming effect zone where the player takes damage is confined to a smaller area in the center this visible cloud, covering about 3 to 4 blocks.\n\nThe harming effect portion of the purple clouds emitted from the dragon's breath attack can be collected in a glass bottle to obtain dragon's breath.\n\nEach bottle of dragon's breath collected removes one block from the lingering damage zone of the breath attack.\n\nThe visible clouds remain for 3 seconds whether the dragons breath is bottled or not.\n\nBy rapidly collecting all of the harmful blocks, usually around three, even a direct hit from the breath attack can be mostly and even entirely negated before the player suffers any damage.\n\nCharge If the player is not near the portal within 5 seconds of the dragon's landing, it charges at players within 150 blocks.\n\nTake-off After four consecutive breath attacks, or if the dragon fails to locate a player within 150 blocks, she takes off from her perch.\n\nShe always takes off in Peaceful difficulty, making it difficult to land melee hits.\n\nThe dragon resumes circling after this state.\n\nEscape If cumulative damage taken while perched exceeds 50 \u00d7 25, the dragon takes off and resets the damage accumulator.\n\nThe accumulator is not reset if she does not take enough damage.\n\nThe dragon resumes circling after this state.\n\nIn Java Edition, when the dragon finally takes a fatal blow, she flies toward the exit portal structure before dying, unless she cannot find it within 150 blocks, or it is inside blocks.\n\nDragon Fireball Dragon Fireball (JE) Dragon Fireball (BE) Behavior Does not exist Details Size Height: 1 Block Width: 1 Block Dragon fireballs are special fireballs that the ender dragon fires while strafing.\n\nThey cannot be deflected unlike ghast fireballs, and they do no impact damage.\n\nInstead, they deposit purple effect clouds across the ground that damages players the same way a lingering potion of Harming does.\n\nThis means that the ender dragon's fireballs deal magic damage, which ignores any damage reduction that comes from the player's armor.\n\nHowever its damage does get reduced by armor enchanted with the Protection enchantment.\n\nThe purple effect cloud's hitbox slowly grows larger in diameter until it disappears.\n\nAs with her close-ranged breath attack, the purple clouds can be bottled to obtain the dragon's breath.\n\nUnlike lingering potions of Harming, the effect cloud does not shrink when affecting mobs.\n\nJava Edition: Ender dragons use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nDragon fireballs use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 While the pillars are preparing to be resummoned, it occurs at 0 seconds, 2.5\u20132.6 seconds, and 4.75\u20135 seconds.\n\nWhen the ender dragon is about to be summoned, it occurs 5\u20134.75 seconds before and 2\u20130 seconds before.\n\n\u2191 Does not trigger at all if the gamerule globalSoundEvents is false Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Ender dragons have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs DragonPhase: A number indicating the dragon's current state.\n\nValid values are: 0=circling, 1=strafing (preparing to shoot a fireball), 2=flying to the portal to land (part of transition to landed state), 3=landing on the portal (part of transition to landed state), 4=taking off from the portal (part of transition out of landed state), 5=landed, performing breath attack, 6=landed, looking for a player for breath attack, 7=landed, roar before beginning breath attack, 8=charging player, 9=flying to portal to die, 10=hovering with no AI (default when using the / summon command).\n\nDragon fireballs have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nEntity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all fireballs Tags common to all projectiles A dragon fireball spawned by a command (left) and the damage and the explosion it caused (right).\n\nThe / summon ender_dragon command, by default, summons a harmless ender dragon that hovers in place  [JE only ].\n\nSetting the DragonPhase tag (by issuing either the / summon ender_dragon ~ ~ ~ {DragonPhase:0} or the / data merge entity <selector> {DragonPhase:0} commands) starts the ender dragon's ordinary behavior, although the health bar does not appear because it is managed by the ender dragon fight status rather than by the dragon entity itself  [JE only ].\n\nIf spawned away from the center of the map (x=0, z=0), it flies to the center then resumes normal behavior (see #Behavior).\n\nTarget selectors for the ender dragon target a total of 9 entities per dragon, as the ender dragon actually consists of 9 entities internally [Java Edition only ].\n\nSo executing at a dragon to summon an arrow summons 9 arrows.\n\nThis section would benefit from the addition of more images.\n\nPlease remove this notice once you've added suitable images to the article.\n\nThe specific instructions are: Ender dragon

The Void does not affect ender dragons.\n\nIf low enough on health, the ender dragon emits beams of light without dying, as if cracked.\n\nName tags cannot be used on an ender dragon.\n\nThe ender dragon's hitbox, especially her wings, is unexpected larger than the ender dragon itself, causing players to be pushed away from her from farther away than usual.\n\nIf the player kills a summoned dragon in the Overworld or Nether, it does not create a portal or an egg.\n\nIn Spectator mode, the player cannot view the perspective of the ender dragon, unlike any other mob.\n\nHowever, it is possible through the use of commands (like / spectate).\n\nWhen this happens, the player's camera appears about 1 block over the dragon's body.\n\nUsing F3 + B  [JE only ] to show hitboxes reveals that the ender dragon's head rotation faces in the opposite direction to where its real head faces.\n\nThis is also why the ender dragon faces the wrong way when set in a monster spawner.\n\nWhen an ender dragon is spawned in the Overworld, it flies to coordinates X=0 and Z=0 and dives at the ground or does the same behavior as if in the End.\n\nIf end crystals are placed in the Overworld, they heal the dragon as normal, but it does not perch anywhere, and continues to fly around forever.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, there is an unused texture file for a dragon fireball item.\n\nIn Super Smash Bros.\n\nUltimate, one of the spirits that comes with the Steve/Alex DLC is the ender dragon.\n\nIt appears as a Legend-class \"spirit\" that makes the user breathe fire for a long time at the start of each battle.\n\nA wither that is summoned to battle the ender dragon cannot deal damage because the ender dragon flies too fast, and she is immune to projectiles when perching.\n\nIf commands or Creative mode are used to get end portal frames and eyes of ender, a player can basically skip to the end poem.\n\nIf a player destroys ender crystals or even hurts the dragon and then uses a player-made portal, upon returning, the player retains their progress. [BE only ] The end dragon has the longest death sound She is clearly biologically female because she can lay eggs.\n\n(It\u2019s best not to think about this too much with chickens and cows) On Reddit, Notch suggested the ender dragon's name to be \"Jean?\" in the same manner he called the player \"Steve?\".\n\n[6] Dinnerbone later stated that he thinks the name is officially \"Jean?\".\n\n[7] Despite this, an article on Minecraft.net states that \"uttering its true name would unleash a destructive force that would obliterate not only the End, but the Nether and the Overworld at the same time.\" [8] Notch referred to the ender dragon as a she on Reddit [citation needed ], the Xbox avatar item Ender Dragon Pet has the description \"A cuter, friendlier version of his bigger, less playful Minecraft sister,\" and the encyclopedia in Bedrock Edition refers to the dragon with feminine pronouns.\n\nhowever, it has been later confirmed by Notch, [9] Brandon Pearce [10] and Jeb [11] that all mobs in Minecraft have no gender, which would include ender dragon unless they don\u2019t count bosses.\n\nBefore she was textured, Notch reported that he was afraid to texture the ender dragon as she was a complicated model.\n\n[12] In the end, the dragon model was so complex Notch stated that he gave up making the texture manually and wrote a texture packer tool to aid him in adding the texture to the model.\n\nNotch also uploaded the code for the tool so others could use the pack.\n\n(Link to the texture packer) [13] Notch joked about how Minecraft was \"going next-gen\" when deadmau5 mentioned this.\n\n[14] Notch has uploaded a video showing why ender dragons do not spawn in the main world, as they would destroy any block they touch.\n\n[15] On Reddit, Notch explained that ender dragons destroy Overworld matter because \"trying to make an AI to properly navigate arbitrary terrain before the code freeze next tuesday [sic ] isn't feasible\".\n\n[16]

they also make loud and lengthy sounds while being stared at.\n\nIf the player continues to maintain eye contact, the enderman does not move [Java Edition only ], although it may teleport away.\n\nOnce the player stops looking at the enderman, it runs toward the back of the player to attack, although it ceases if hit by another player or mob.\n\n[2] An aggravated enderman runs fast and often teleports to the location of a player or mob up to 32 blocks away (orthogonally).\n\nEndermen are not provoked by a player viewing it through a transparent block or while wearing a carved pumpkin.\n\nAn aggravated enderman pursues the player until it is either killed or distracted by external elements, such as rain or fire.\n\nThey do not take damage from sunlight like undead mobs, but when at a sufficient light level under the sky during the day they teleport randomly, typically winding up in caves (although certain non-full blocks, such as soul sand and mud, also register as \"dark\" when the enderman is standing in them).\n\nEndermen can be harmed by melee attacks, water, lava, fire, splash water bottles, or rain.\n\nThey are not damaged when standing in a filled cauldron  [Java Edition only ].\n\n[3] Endermen teleport away when they take damage from any of natural sources (1), continuing to do so until they find a safe location.\n\nThey also teleport while taking damage from other sources, such as suffocation, Poison, or Wither.\n\nRanged attacks are largely ineffective against endermen, as they teleport when hit by a projectile instead of taking damage.\n\nEndermen that are hit by projectiles do not become hostile.\n\n[4] Arrows  [Java Edition only ] and tridents appear to bounce off an enderman who is unable to teleport.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, arrows go straight through endermen that are unable to teleport (but the effect still goes through if it's a tipped arrow).\n\n[needs in-game testing ].\n\nRocket crossbows do affect endermen and can trigger endermen hostility toward the shooter.\n\nEndermen can step up one full block without having to jump.\n\nEndermen are hostile to endermites within 64 blocks but are passive to other mobs unless provoked.\n\nAn enderman in a player's vicinity prevents the player from sleeping in a bed at night as if any hostile mob were nearby.\n\nIf the player is already asleep in a bed, it is possible for an enderman to teleport on it and wake players by pushing them off.\n\nThe endermen's aggression range for being looked at is reduced when the player is sneaking, or under the Invisibility effect depending on the number of armor pieces currently worn.\n\nThe detection range in blocks for invisible players is shown in the following table: They play a sound exclusively at the teleportation destination.\n\n[5] Each teleportation attempt chooses a random destination 32 blocks along each axis (i.e.\n\na 64\u00d764\u00d764 cube centered on the current position).\n\nIt then applies the following checks: As long as the selected block is not a made of a movement-blocking material, seek downwards.\n\nIf the found block is waterlogged, the teleportation attempt fails.\n\nStarting again with the originally selected target, seek downwards as long as the block below is not a made of a movement-blocking material.\n\nThe teleportation attempt succeeds if no liquid or solid blocks prevent them from standing at the destination.\n\nThus, endermen need at least three non-solid blocks above the destination to successfully teleport, and do not teleport to waterlogged blocks unless the ceiling above is made of a non-waterlogged movement-blocking material.\n\n[6] Blocks that have a large enough collision box but are not made of a movement-blocking material, such as carpet that is not above a block made of a movement-blocking material, snow layers 10 or more deep, and azalea, can be used to prevent teleportation.\n\nEndermen always teleport an integer Y distance, so an enderman at Y=70.0 cannot teleport onto a movement-blocking block covered by a single carpet, snow layers only 2 deep, or many other short blocks, while an enderman at Y=70.99 could teleport onto snow layers 8 or 9 deep.\n\nEndermen always attempt to teleport upon taking damage.\n\nMost melee attacks are successful, but the enderman usually teleports a few blocks behind the player when hit, if there is space behind the player.\n\nEndermen can be attacked with projectiles if they are in a boat or minecart. [Java Edition only ] If all available blocks within teleport distance are removed or unavailable as a destination, it is possible to hit endermen in Java Edition with a projectile, although arrows may simply bounce off, dealing no damage.\n\n[7] When teleporting due to damage, it makes 64 attempts to teleport.\n\nIn Java Edition, an enderman cannot teleport while it is in a minecart or boat, although in rain and water it attempts to do so, always teleporting back repeatedly until death.\n\nThis does not occur in Bedrock Edition.\n\n[8] Unlike any other mobs, which cannot hold blocks except as items, endermen have a unique ability to pick up, carry and set down certain blocks.\n\nThey silently [9] pick up blocks in a 4\u00d73\u00d74 (xyz) region horizontally centered on the enderman and vertically encompassing it.\n\nAn enderman cannot pick up blocks in a completely flat area.\n\nEndermen drop the block they are holding upon death as an item, although they do not visually let go of the block when dying.\n\n[10] [11] It does not despawn while holding a block.\n\nEndermen cannot place blocks onto bedrock or entities.\n\nEndermen can pick up the following blocks: Cactus Clay Coarse Dirt Rooted Dirt Dirt Flowers (short) Fungi Roots Grass Block Gravel Melon Moss Block Mud Muddy Mangrove Roots Mushrooms Mycelium Nylium Podzol Pumpkins Red Sand Sand TNT Data packs from Java Edition can change this list by modifying the minecraft:enderman_holdable block tag.\n\nBedrock Edition behavior packs can not modify these as the list is hard-coded behind the minecraft:behavior.enderman_take_block method.\n\nWhile carrying a block, the enderman sometimes silently [12] places it in a 2\u00d72\u00d72 region horizontally centered on the enderman and

maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe developers have stated that the belief that enderman sounds are backward distortions is just speculation.\n\n[21] Notch claimed in public that the enderman is a \"subtle reference\" to the Slenderman, a similar-looking monster with a similar name.\n\nGiven the later development of the End, it is possible he already had the name in mind, and did not choose it because of the Reddit thread in which their name was revealed.\n\n[22] According to Burnie Burns, former CEO of Rooster Teeth, the idea for endermen's weakness to water came from his son JD during a visit to Mojang's headquarters.\n\n[23] Dinnerbone suggested \"a haunting of endermen\" as the collective noun for Endermen.\n\n[24] Additionally, in the third episode of Minecraft: Story Mode, The Last Place You Look, a player is given the option to correct the grammar of other characters by specifying that the collective noun for a group of endermen is \"a haunting of Endermen\".\n\nIn the fourth Minecraft novel Minecraft: The End, the collective term used by endermen themselves is \"an End of Endermen\".\n\nSwitching to spectator mode and taking an enderman's point of view adds a shader that inverts colors, suggesting that they see the End as an island of blue cobblestone (as end stone is a yellowish version of cobblestone with inverted colors) in a white sky, with white pillars, white endermen with green eyes and a white ender dragon, also with green eyes.\n\nThey also see cobblestone as end stone.\n\nThe texture for an enderman's eyes is located in a different texture file than the body, allowing their eyes to glow.\n\nBecause the two textures do not line up perfectly, forcing an enderman to look straight up causes its eyes to turn blank white.\n\nThis also causes the enderman's eyes to be visible even when under the Invisibility effect.\n\nThe enderman teleportation sound also plays when a player teleports using an ender pearl  [Bedrock Edition only ] or chorus fruit.\n\nThe enderman is a playable DLC character in the crossover fighting game Super Smash Bros.\n\nUltimate as an alternate costume for Steve, though with altered proportions to be at Steve's height.\n\nAdditionally, there is an enderman \"spirit\" that makes the user vulnerable to damage by water, as are regular endermen.\n\nEndermen are trying to bring about the collapse to all dimensions, as revealed in the 2019 book Minecraft Game Design.\n\n[25] Enderman holding a grass block Enderman holding sand Enderman holding a cactus Enderman holding TNT Enderman

    "content": "This article is about the mob.\n\nFor the block, see Shulker Box.\n\nFor the item, see Shulker Shell.\n\nShulker Open Closed View all renders Health 30 \u00d7 15 Behavior Hostile Passive (Peaceful difficulty) Spawn End city Damage 4 Levitation: Levitation for 10 seconds Usable items Dye  [Bedrock Edition only ] Details Size Closed: Height: 1 Block Width: 1 Block Peeking: Height: 1.2 Blocks Width: 1 Block Open: Height: 2 Blocks Width: 1 Block Armor 20 (\u00d7 10) when closed, 0 () when opened A shulker is a box-shaped hostile mob found in end cities.\n\nIt hides in its shell to protect itself and blend in with its surroundings.\n\nIt attacks by shooting homing bullets at the player which inflict Levitation.\n\nIt is the only source of shulker shells, which are used to craft shulker boxes.\n\nShulkers spawn during the generation of end cities, which are located on the outer islands of the End.\n\nThey usually spawn on the walls of the city and on end ships.\n\nThey do not despawn naturally, even in Peaceful difficulty.\n\nThere is a chance that a new shulker of the same color will spawn when a shulker is hit with a shulker bullet (including one of its own).\n\nThe following conditions need to be met: When the shulker gets hit and then has less than half its health remaining, there is a 25% chance it will try to teleport without spawning a new shulker instead of checking the conditions below.\n\nThe hit shulker must have its lid open.\n\nThe hit shulker needs to find somewhere to teleport.\n\nFor this, it takes a random block in a 17\u00d717\u00d717 cuboid centered on the shulker and then checks if the block has a valid face to teleport to.\n\nIf not it proceeds to try this up to 4 more times.\n\nIf no valid face is found, the attempt fails.\n\nEach other shulker within 8 blocks of the hit shulker decreases the odds of success by 20%.\n\nWhen five or more other shulkers are nearby, no shulkers will spawn, but the hit shulker still teleports.\n\nIf the attempt succeeds a new shulker spawns where the old shulker was before it teleported.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, shulkers drop 0\u20131 shulker shells.\n\nThe maximum can be increased by 1 per level of Looting, which is 0\u20134 shells with Looting III.\n\nIn Java Edition, shulkers have a 50% chance of dropping a shulker shell when killed.\n\nThis is increased by 6.25% per level of Looting, for a maximum of 68.75% with Looting III.\n\nShulkers also drop 5 when killed by a player or a tamed wolf.\n\nThe shell of the mob looks similar to a purpur block, blending in to its natural surroundings.\n\nInside the shell of the mob is a small yellow head with two eyes.\n\nShulkers are uncolored by default when using spawn eggs, while white is the default when using / summon or spawners.\n\nSpawning shulkers with other colors can be done using the / summon command, as detailed below.\n\nShulkers generally remain stationary, attached to an adjacent block with a full face.\n\n[1] However, if the block the shulker occupies becomes something other than air or the shulker finds itself not adjacent to any full face, or the shell cannot fully open (due to solid blocks or entities such as boats or other shulkers), it attempts to teleport (5 attempts per tick) to an air block within a 17\u00d717\u00d717 cube centered on the shulker where the shulker can attach to a full face and open.\n\nIf it finds no valid position to teleport onto it does not move.\n\nShulkers evaluate the collision box of scaffolding based on their current position, [2] which can result in the shulker teleporting to a position only to find it invalid and teleport again.\n\nShulkers occasionally open their shell for 1\u20133 seconds.\n\nWhen a target comes within about 16 blocks, it opens fully and shoots guided projectiles that follow the player, called shulker bullets, moving only along the X, Y, or Z axes and leaving trails of white particles.\n\nThe projectiles can be destroyed by attacking them or blocked with a shield.\n\nIf the projectile hits an entity, it does 4 of damage and inflicts the Levitation status effect for 10 seconds, this status effect has no effect underwater [3]  [Java Edition only ], or while riding a mob.\n\nThe shulker continues firing every 1\u20135.5 seconds while the target remains in range.\n\nIf the shulker's target dies with projectiles still in flight, they fall to the ground.\n\nShulkers can attack each other, in which case they shoot fully guided bullets at each other, but are unaffected by Levitation when hit.\n\nThe normal teleportation habits apply during these battles, and is likely to result in the duplication of more shulkers.\n\nWhen its shell is closed, a shulker has 20 (\u00d7 10) armor points and deflects arrows.\n\nWhen the shell opens, it loses this natural armor and takes damage as normal.\n\nWhen at less than half health, a shulker has a 25% chance of teleporting (as described above) after taking damage.\n\nWhen a shulker is attacked, other shulkers in the area target the attacker as well.\n\nShulkers don't take burning damage from lava or fire.\n\nThey drown in water, but try to teleport away when water or lava flows into the block they occupy.\n\nIn Peaceful difficulty, shulkers exist within the world, but do not attack, [4] like vindicators, evokers and piglin brutes in Bedrock Edition.\n\nShulkers are treated differently than true blocks.\n\nFor example, mobs are unable to pathfind around [5] or jump over them, [6] and falling on them from a height does not produce particles.\n\n[7] Their spawn egg also does not destroy blocks such as grass.\n\n[8] In Bedrock Edition, they apply Levitation II instead of I.\n\nShulkers spawned as part of a team using / summon attack most hostile mobs without provocation.\n\nThey never attack their teammates intentionally and do not retaliate even when being hit, however the shulkers will still target players without a team or in another team.\n\nShulker bullet Behavior Does not exist Details Size Height: 0.3125 Blocks Width: 0.3125 Blocks A shulker bullet is a guided projectile that is shot from shulkers, and they follow the targeted entity along the X, Y, or Z axis and leave trails of white particles.\n\nA shulker bullet that hits a mob or player deals damage and affects them with Levitation for ten seconds.\n\nThe shulker's projectiles also have entity data that control its movement.\n\nThe bullet can be destroyed by hitting it with any item, shooting it with an arrow, or blocking it with a shield.\n\nIt explodes upon contact with a block.\n\nThe explosion does not destroy any blocks and does not damage nearby mobs or players.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, shulkers can be dyed in a similar fashion to sheep.\n\nUsing a dye on a shulker gives it the color of the dye.\n\nIn Java Edition, the color of a shulker is changed through commands using the color byte tag.\n\nA shulker is transported in the Overworld by boat.\n\nPistons raise the boat uphill.\n\nShulkers can be moved by boats or minecarts; pushing a boat/cart into a shulker causes it to board.\n\nA boat's sides block some of a shulkers projectiles.\n\nA shulker pushed through the exit portal gets transported to the world spawn point in the Overworld.\n\nSince shulkers teleport when not adjacent to a solid block, they must be pushed down the central pillar of the exit portal (or a manually placed block directly above the portal) with a piston.\n\nJava Edition: Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Shulker bullets use

    "content": "This article is about the Minecraft passive mob that collects items.\n\nFor the hostile mob summoned by evokers, see Vex.\n\nFor the mob in Minecraft Dungeons that inspired the allay, see MCD:Wisp.\n\nFor the mob in Minecraft Legends, see MCL:Allay.\n\nAllay Health 20 \u00d7 10 Behavior Passive Spawn Pillager Outpost Woodland Mansion Usable items Any item Details Size Height: 0.6 Blocks Width: 0.6 Blocks The allay (https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:AllayPronunciation.mp3 /\u0259\u02c8le\u026a/ uh-\u029f\u1d00\u028f) is a flying passive mob that collects and delivers items for any player that gives it something or any note block it hears recently playing.\n\nAllays can be found surrounding pillager outposts, confined inside dark oak cages.\n\nOne to three allays can spawn in each cage.\n\nThey have a 50% chance of spawning here.\n\nTwo allays inside a woodland mansion cell.\n\nAllays can also spawn inside jail cells within woodland mansions.\n\nOne to three allays can spawn in each cell.\n\nThey have a 50% chance of spawning here.\n\nAllay can be duplicated/bred by playing a Music Disk in a Jukebox with Allay nearby and then clicking the Allay with a Amethyst Shard while they are dancing.\n\nUnlike other mobs only 1 allay is needed for breeding/duplication and they have no baby variant.\n\nThe allay's luminous texture allows it to be seen clearly in the dark, although it doesn't illuminate its surroundings.\n\nThe allay is small, peaceful and flies aimlessly until a player gives it an item with their use key.\n\nThe allay starts following the player and seeks out dropped versions of the same item to deliver them to its player.\n\nThe allay returns to wandering around if any player takes its item back by using an empty hand on it.\n\nThe allay locks onto the player that last gave it an item.\n\nThis allay follows the player from up to a 64-block cubic area away and seeks items up to a 32-block cubic area away from the player.\n\nAfter delivering items, the allay has a delay of three seconds until it can seek items again.\n\nAn allay has a single inventory slot to hold a stack of items (usually 64 items) in addition to the item it got from the player.\n\nWhile the allay does not discern enchantments, special item names or items in shulker boxes when it seeks, it still carries such items in separate trips.\n\nAllays don't pick up any items if the game rule / gamerule mobGriefing is set to false, but the player can still give the allay items with the use key.\n\nIf the allay hears a note block play within 16 blocks of its location while delivering items, it will instead deliver its items to the note block and then spend 30 seconds around that particular note block, seeking items around it and returning them to it instead of its player.\n\nThe allay returns to targeting its player after 30 seconds.\n\nA vibration particle emanates from the note block and reaches the allay to indicate the allay has locked on to the note block.\n\nBecause the allay and the note block interact via a vibration particle, placing wool between the note block and the allay can prevent this sound interaction.\n\nThe allay can pick up items within a radius of about 1.3 blocks from itself and drop items up to 3 blocks away from its player or note block.\n\nAn allay performs a dance animation when there is a nearby jukebox playing.\n\nIf the jukebox stops playing or if the allay gets too far away from the jukebox, it stops dancing.\n\nIf the allay is given an amethyst shard while dancing, it plays a small amethyst sound, makes a heart animation and duplicates into another allay.\n\nAfter that duplication, both allays have a five minute cooldown before being able to duplicate again.\n\nThe allay cannot enter water, although it attempts to gather items that are under water.\n\nThe allay will, however, seek out water when on fire and douse itself [1].\n\nAllays cannot be harmed by their interacted owners.\n\nIf they are harmed by another source, they fly away for a few seconds.\n\nWhen killed, allays drop the items they were holding.\n\nIf an allay dies while holding a totem of undying, it instead returns to full health and the totem is destroyed, as with any mob holding a totem of undying.\n\nAllays naturally regenerate 2 per second if damaged.\n\nIn Java Edition, using a lead or a named name tag performs the item's normal function, instead of giving it to the allay.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition.\n\nAllays in the End.\n\nWhen a player teleports through a nether portal, the player's allay teleports also, even if it does not enter the portal.\n\nWhen a player teleports through an end portal, the allay teleports to the End only if a player gives the

originally planned for the Nether Update.\n\n[4] Some previous names considered for the allay were the wisp and the pixie.\n\n[4] The allays were created to solve the problem of how players would build structures and collect resources in Minecraft Legends while focusing on defending the overworld.\n\n[5] The reason why allay duplication uses amethyst shards is because the item is renewable, has a musical sound that fits with the allay, and it adds more value to amethyst geodes.\n\n[6] [7] According to the \"meet the allay\" article on Minecraft.net, the reason why allays can be tamed by players is because they form a \"magical connection\" when that player gives it an item.\n\nThis bond is what prevents players from accidentally harming their allay.\n\n[8] Originally, Mojang considered having allays naturally spawn within forest biomes.\n\nHowever, the reason they went with pillager outposts and woodland mansions, was because they wanted to highlight the companionship aspect.\n\n[9] It has also been theorized that the reason for why Illagers capture Allays in the first place is likely because of their connection with the Vexes.\n\nDespite that they are flying mobs, allays can destroy turtle eggs when on top of them.\n\n[10] An allay holding an item.\n\nAn allay idling.\n\nAn allay flying.\n\nAn allay flying in a different angle.\n\nAn allay dancing.\n\nAn allay

there is a 1% chance for it to increase by 2.\n\nWhen the amount reaches 5, honey can be seen dripping from the bottom and front of the hive/nest.\n\nA hive/nest must have 5 honey inside before a player can collect honeycombs or honey bottles.\n\nA bee coming out of a bee nest.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Honey farming Bees live together in colonies and take any bee nest or beehive that has enough space as their home.\n\nOne bee nest or beehive can house up to 3 bees.\n\nHomeless bees wander around, searching for empty beehives.\n\nBees can enter a beehive from any side, but exit only from the front.\n\nOne-way bee-gates can be made in this way.\n\nBees return to their nest when it rains or when it is night.\n\nThey return even when in biomes that don't rain like desert.\n\nThey stay in their nest or hive for at least 2400 game ticks (2 minutes) before coming back out.\n\nThe bees that come out keep their data (health, name, etc.).\n\nBreaking a nest or hive that contains bees releases all the bees.\n\nIf a bee nest containing bees is harvested using a tool enchanted with Silk Touch, the bees inside are kept, with their corresponding data, in the hive.\n\nThey can exit the hive again when it is placed.\n\nWhen a bee that has pollen enters and then leaves its nest or hive, the honey level of the nest or hive is increased by one.\n\nWhen the honey level of that hive reaches 5, the player can harvest it, which then sets it back to 0.\n\nBecause there is neither daylight cycle nor weather in the Nether and the End, bees work without resting in these dimensions.\n\nThis behavior is distinct from that of the villagers, which follow their daily routine according to the time in the Overworld, regardless of which dimension they are in.\n\nMain article: Damage All bees nearby are angered when an individual bee is attacked (unless the bee attacked is killed in one hit [Java Edition only ]), honey or honeycombs are collected (unless a campfire is placed under the nest), or a beehive is destroyed.\n\nHitting or walking on a nest does not anger bees; it must be destroyed to anger them.\n\nWhen destroyed, a beehive releases any bees that it contained, and the bees will be angry.\n\nIf the beehive is destroyed with a Silk Touch tool, bees outside the hive become angry  [Bedrock Edition only ], [8] while those kept within it remain neutral even after the hive is placed again.\n\nThe Invisibility effect does not cause stingers in stung players to disappear.\n\nBees attack and swarm the player as a group when angered, and the eyes of angered bees turn blood red.\n\nCollecting a honeycomb or a honey bottle from a nest or hive causes the bees that are currently in that nest or hive to leave and swarm the player unless a campfire is placed below the hive.\n\nBees attack only once, similarly to llamas and non-aggressive pandas.\n\nBees do not deal any damage in Peaceful difficulty.\n\nIf the player deflects a bee's attack with a shield, the bee continues attacking until it succeeds in hitting the player.\n\nWhen a bee's attack on a player succeeds, the player is poisoned.\n\nA bee loses its stinger after a successful attack, cannot attack further, and dies approximately one minute later.\n\nThis can be delayed with potions (Regeneration / Resistance / Absorption) that have a 255 potency.\n\nIt is possible to (quickly) breed at least one angered bee with another, even if it or they had stung and lost the stinger.\n\nHowever, they remain angered and still die later due to having lost their stingers.\n\nBees also swarm and attack other mobs when damaged; for example, if a skeleton accidentally shoots a bee.\n\nBees become neutral if they fail to land a hit on their target within 25 seconds.\n\nThe stinging animation; the bee can remain upside down for longer periods of time if a distance is kept.\n\nPrior to stinging After stinging In Java Edition, a bee's stinger is visible on the player as a small black dot after the bee successfully attacked.\n\nMain article: Honey Block Bees attach themselves to honey blocks, as if they are \"eating\" the block.\n\nMain article: Breeding Bees follow players holding flowers, flowering azalea, cherry leaves, flowering azalea leaves and mangrove propagule.\n\nIf the player is standing still and being followed by bees, the bees go toward the player, face the player, and rest on the ground.\n\nThey do this until the player moves.\n\nIf bees are given a flower, they enter love mode and pair up to create baby bees, granting the player 1-7 experience.\n\nThe parent bees have a cooldown of 5 minutes (6000 ticks) before they can breed again.\n\nBabies take 20 minutes (1 in-game day) to grow up.\n\nThe growth of baby bees can be accelerated using flowers; each use reduces the remaining time by 10%.\n\nHowever, bees' growth timer and breeding cooldowns are frozen while working in a hive; thus, when rapidly growing a population, it may be desirable to temporarily remove the hives.\n\nAny of the 1- or 2-block flowers can be used for breeding, including the wither rose, [9] even though it usually harms bees that touch it.\n\nJava Edition: Bees use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 loop1 and 2 are multiplied by 0.6;

[Bedrock Edition only ] A blaze shoots only when it has a clear line of sight to its target.\n\nIf line of sight is broken in the middle of its volley, the blaze suspends the remainder of its volley until line of sight returns.\n\nWhen using this attack, the blaze burns with fire for 3 seconds, shoots three small fireballs over the course of 0.9 seconds, then extinguishes its flames and waits for 5 seconds before attacking again.\n\nA blaze shoots its small fireballs with roughly the same lack of accuracy as a dispenser; however, the blaze's shots maintain the same speed all the way to the target, unlike the dispenser's, which start slow and accelerate.\n\nA blaze that touches its target performs a melee attack that does 6 damage on normal difficulty, once per second.\n\nThis attack is not considered fire damage and does not ignite the target.\n\nThis cannot be prevented by the Fire Resistance status effect.\n\nJava Edition: Blazes use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Main article: Entity format Blazes have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nEntity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nFor information specifically pertaining to small fireballs, see Small Fireball \u00a7 History.\n\nIssues relating to \"Blaze\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nBlazes can see the player through walls.\n\nWhen throwing a potion of Invisibility on a blaze, the smoke remains visible.\n\nAccording to Jens Bergensten, blazes look the way they do because all mobs in Minecraft are cuboid-shape, so to make them flame-like and magical, he created them as a core surrounded by rotating rods.\n\n[3] Blazes originally didn't have eyes when Jens Bergensten was first creating them and \"just looked like a yellow rock\".\n\nEyes were added to \"give it more personality\".\n\n[4] Despite not having visible feet, blazes are still capable of making footstep sounds.\n\n[5] According to Minecraft's \"Visit the Nether!\" blazes are sentient beings made of pure lava.\n\nThe article theorizes they were created by the original inhabitants of nether fortresses to serve as guards, but their creators lost control over the blazes and were subsequently destroyed by them.\n\n[6] On the official T-shirt \"Alchemy\" by JINX, the blaze is in the form of the Vitruvian Man and the text uses the Standard Galactic Alphabet.\n\nThe words on the outside of the ring translate to: \"nigredo\", \"albedo\", \"citrinitas\", and \"rubedo\" [note 1] which are all relating to magnum opus.\n\nThe words on the ring translate to (starting from the top): \"B * Crowmer\", \"poison * speed\", \"strenth * resist\" [sic ], \"vision * heal\", and \"regeneration\" relating to potions and probably the artist's name.\n\nOn the connecting lines the words translate to: \"potln of thickness\" [sic ], \"potln of awkward\" [sic ], \"weakness potion\" and \"mundane potion\" relating to base potions.\n\nAs part of an official collaboration, blazes are included as monsters in a free add-on for the roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n[7] In the game, they are \"Elementals\" and have the alignment \"Typically Neutral Evil\".\n\nA close up look at a blaze spawner in a Nether fortress.\n\nZoomed out view of the blaze spawner, showing the spawner area and a spawned blaze.\n\nMultiple blazes shooting small fireballs at the player as they hover around their spawner.\n\nA Blaze that was spawned in the Overworld is taking damage from snowy weather.\n\n(Before 20w06a) Disabling a blaze spawner with 9 glowstone blocks.\n\nGlowstone can be replaced with other light sources of light level 15.\n\nA triggered blaze preparing to attack who still hasn't flown.\n\nA triggered blaze preparing to attack with fire around it, floating on the wall of a Nether fortress.\n\nA blaze and a wither skeleton idling in a Nether fortress.\n\nTwo blazes spawned near a blaze spawner and a wither skeleton.\n\nBlazes spawned by a spawner.\n\nA blaze spawner platform with blazes.\n\nA blaze without particles.\n\nThe Blaze as it appears in Minecraft: Story Mode.\n\nThe Blaze as it appears in Minecraft Dungeons.\n\nOfficial LEGO Blaze minifigure.\n\nOfficial T-shirt artwork \"Alchemy\" featuring a blaze.\n\nMade by JINX.\n\nOfficial blaze statistics for D&D.\n\n\u2191 There is a nether track titled Rubedo.\n\n\u2191 https://youtu.be/enIW9AJ1Zxk \u2191 MC-194697 \u2191 https://minecraft.net/en-us/article/meet-blaze \u2191 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3TXUTLClb0&t=0s \u2191 MC-92623 \u2191 \"Visit the Nether!\" by Duncan Geere.\n\nMinecraft.net, November 10, 2019 \u2191 https://www.dndbeyond.com/claim/source/minecraft-creatures-monstrous-compendium Meet the Blaze \u2013 Minecraft.net on December 20, 2016 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

    "content": "\"Dragon\" redirects here.\n\nFor the mentioned feature, see Red Dragon.\n\nFor the rendering engine, see RenderDragon.\n\nFor other uses, see Dragon (disambiguation).\n\nEnder Dragon Health 200 \u00d7 100 Classification Animal Behavior Hostile Spawn The End Damage Melee: Peaceful: 0 (but still performs attack animation) Easy: 6 Normal: 10 Hard: 15 \u00d7 7.5 Wings: Easy: 3 Normal: 5 Hard: 7 Dragon's Breath: 3 per second Dragon Fireball: 6 per second Details Size Height: 8 Blocks Width: 16 Blocks Length: 16 Blocks The ender dragon is a giant flying hostile boss mob found when first entering the End.\n\nShe is the largest naturally spawning mob in the game.\n\nShe guards access to the end gateways that provide entry to the outer end islands in addition to the exit portal that allows return to the Overworld as well as access to the end credits of Minecraft.\n\nBecause of this, she is known by most Minecraft fans as the 'final boss' of the game.\n\nHer attacks involve charging at the player and her unique dragon acid attacks.\n\nThe ender dragon spawns 20 game ticks (1 second) after an entity first arrives in the End, along with the bedrock frame for the exit portal.\n\nThis image shows how the player can arrange end crystals to respawn the ender dragon.\n\nPlayers can re-summon the dragon by placing four end crystals on the edges of the exit portal, one on each side.\n\nWhen it is re-summoned, the four end crystals point to the tops of each pillar setting off a series of explosions that resets the obsidian pillars, iron bars, and end crystals.\n\nThe top of each pillar explodes, destroying any player-placed blocks.\n\nEventually, all of the end crystals point at the coordinates of (0.0, 128, 0.0) and the ender dragon spawns there.\n\nThe four crystals placed around the exit portal then explode.\n\nIf the player does not pick up the dragon egg and starts to re-summon the dragon, the dragon egg disappears.\n\nIf the dragon goes through an end gateway, another immediately spawns at (0, 128, 0) while the other dragon flies to (0, 128, 0).\n\nAfter the ender dragon is slain for the first time, the following events take place: She slowly ascends, her wings and body becoming more tattered until she disappears in beams of light erupting from her center.\n\nThere's an explosion of 12000 experience points (ten drops of 960 and one drop of 2400) \u2014 enough to bring a player from level 0 to level 68.\n\nIf killed on top of the bedrock structure, some of the experience orbs can drop into the exit portal.\n\nThe experience orbs can then be retrieved in the overworld.\n\nThe bedrock structure fills in with an end portal interface to become the exit portal, enabling the player to transport back to the Overworld and respawn at their spawn point.\n\nA dragon egg appears above the island's central bedrock structure.\n\nIf a block exists right above the center of the central bedrock structure, then the dragon egg spawns 1 block above the highest block at (0,0).\n\nIf the highest block is at the height limit, then the dragon egg does not spawn.\n\nAn end gateway portal is generated floating within 75\u2013100 blocks of the exit portal.\n\nWhen a re-summoned ender dragon is slain, the same events occur except that only 500 experience points are dropped [Java Edition only ] and no more than 20 gateway portals are generated.\n\nThe dragon egg appears the first time the ender dragon is slain in Java Edition, and the first and second time in Bedrock Edition; it does not appear after any subsequent dragon slaying.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Defeating the ender dragon During the battle with the ender dragon, unique music called \" Boss \" plays, the edges of the screen darkens and black fog appears, and chunks around the exit portal are constantly loaded regardless of render distance.\n\nThese happen as long as there is at least one player within a Euclidean distance of 192 blocks from (0.0, 128, 0.0).\n\nThe ender dragon has a light purple health bar that appears at the top of the player 's screen.\n\nHer health is frequently restored by nearby end crystals, indicated by a magical white beam connecting the dragon and the crystal.\n\nDestroying an end crystal that is actively healing the dragon causes 10 damage to her.\n\nThe dragon can take damage only from explosions and player-based damage, and takes damage of (1 \u2044 4 \u00d7 normal damage + 1) when hit on any part that is not her head, making it the most resilient mob in the game.\n\nSuffocation is completely non-applicable, as she either phases through or immediately destroys any block she touches.\n\nThe dragon is immune to all status effects.\n\nThe green hitboxes of the ender Dragon.\n\nBy using the F3 + B shortcut, the dragon's bounding box appears. [Java Edition only ] She cannot be damaged at just any spot in this large volume: eight green sub- hitboxes are also shown, which indicate the locations where the dragon can take damage: The tail, body, head, and wings.\n\nThe ender dragon is a flying mob, which cannot actually stand on the ground.\n\nShe flies around the end main island while fighting the player.\n\nThe dragon can pass through all blocks, destroying almost all types, but can still be affected by flowing water, lava and bubble column.\n\nBlocks not destroyed are those that naturally generate on the central End island and those that are intended to be indestructible, such as end stone and respawn anchors: Barrier Bedrock Command Block Crying Obsidian End stone End portal (block) End portal frame End gateway (block) Fire Iron bars Light Block Obsidian Reinforced Deepslate Respawn Anchor Structure Block In Java Edition, these blocks are marked under the dragon_immune tag, with the exception of light blocks and fire, which are marked as dragon_transparent.\n\nDestroyed blocks are not dropped, although containers (such as chests and dispensers, but not shulker boxes) drop their contents.\n\nThe dragon \"bathing\" endermen with its toxic breath attack.\n\nThe dragon never targets any entity but the player, although other mobs may turn hostile to the dragon when hit, and the dragon may sometimes retaliate against other mobs if it takes damage to a projectile.\n\nAny entities hit by her wings are dealt 5 damage (or 10 damage if hit by her head), and in Java Edition, are thrown into the air, sometimes to fatal heights or even off the island.\n\nNeither of these effects is applied for 1 \u2044 2 second after the dragon takes damage.\n\nThe ender dragon has four main states of behavior: Guarding The dragon begins in this state, circling the ring of obsidian pillars on either the outside if there are still end crystals or the inside if the crystals are destroyed.\n\nWith each crystal's destruction, she takes damage and there is an increased chance of the dragon switching states.\n\nTargeting Whenever the dragon finds herself less than 10 blocks or more than 150 blocks from her current target, she attempts to choose a new target.\n\nWhen damaged she targets a point just behind herself, causing her to turn away and choose a new target.\n\nStrafing Upon the destruction of an end crystal, the dragon switches to strafing.\n\nAs soon as it is within 64 blocks, she shoots a fireball at the player.\n\nThe dragon resumes circling after this state.\n\nDiving The dragon dives onto the target player's position, taken at the start of the dive.\n\nThe dragon resumes circling after this state, whether or not she actually hit the player.\n\nPerching While Guarding and the dragon has reached the end of the path, she has 1 in (3 + crystals alive) chance (~7.7% up to 33%) to go to the exit portal structure (approaching from the side opposite the player if possible) and lands on the highest block of the coordinates (x=0, z=0), up to (y=101). [Bedrock Edition only ] If there is no block in (x=0, z=0) the dragon freezes right when she switches to perching. [Bedrock Edition only ] The dragon is immune to arrows in this state; they all catch fire and bounce off.\n\nIn Java Edition she is also immune to thrown tridents in this state.\n\nDragon's Breath Unless the player is in Peaceful difficulty, after 1.25 seconds, if a player is within 20 blocks of the exit portal structure, the dragon roars and use its 3-second breath attack, damaging players similarly to a lingering potion of Harming.\n\nAn area of visible particles in the shape of a horizontal disc one block tall and 5 to 6 blocks in diameter appears where the breath attack strikes, either on the ground or floating in the air, at whatever point the breath attack struck a block.\n\nThe harming effect zone where the player takes damage is confined to a smaller area in the center this visible cloud, covering about 3 to 4 blocks.\n\nThe harming effect portion of the purple clouds emitted from the dragon's breath attack can be collected in a glass bottle to obtain dragon's breath.\n\nEach bottle of dragon's breath collected removes one block from the lingering damage zone of the breath attack.\n\nThe visible clouds remain for 3 seconds whether the dragons breath is bottled or not.\n\nBy rapidly collecting all of the harmful blocks, usually around three, even a direct hit from the breath attack can be mostly and even entirely negated before the player suffers any damage.\n\nCharge If the player is not near the portal within 5 seconds of the dragon's landing, it charges at players within 150 blocks.\n\nTake-off After four consecutive breath attacks, or if the dragon fails to locate a player within 150 blocks, she takes off from her perch.\n\nShe always takes off in Peaceful difficulty, making it difficult to land melee hits.\n\nThe dragon resumes circling after this state.\n\nEscape If cumulative damage taken while perched exceeds 50 \u00d7 25, the dragon takes off and resets the damage accumulator.\n\nThe accumulator is not reset if she does not take enough damage.\n\nThe dragon resumes circling after this state.\n\nIn Java Edition, when the dragon finally takes a fatal blow, she flies toward the exit portal structure before dying, unless she cannot find it within 150 blocks, or it is inside blocks.\n\nDragon Fireball Dragon Fireball (JE) Dragon Fireball (BE) Behavior Does not exist Details Size Height: 1 Block Width: 1 Block Dragon fireballs are special fireballs that the ender dragon fires while strafing.\n\nThey cannot be deflected unlike ghast fireballs, and they do no impact damage.\n\nInstead, they deposit purple effect clouds across the ground that damages players the same way a lingering potion of Harming does.\n\nThis means that the ender dragon's fireballs deal magic damage, which ignores any damage reduction that comes from the player's armor.\n\nHowever its damage does get reduced by armor enchanted with the Protection enchantment.\n\nThe purple effect cloud's hitbox slowly grows larger in diameter until it disappears.\n\nAs with her close-ranged breath attack, the purple clouds can be bottled to obtain the dragon's breath.\n\nUnlike lingering potions of Harming, the effect cloud does not shrink when affecting mobs.\n\nJava Edition: Ender dragons use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nDragon fireballs use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 While the pillars are preparing to be resummoned, it occurs at 0 seconds, 2.5\u20132.6 seconds, and 4.75\u20135 seconds.\n\nWhen the ender dragon is about to be summoned, it occurs 5\u20134.75 seconds before and 2\u20130 seconds before.\n\n\u2191 Does not trigger at all if the gamerule globalSoundEvents is false Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Ender dragons have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs DragonPhase: A number indicating the dragon's current state.\n\nValid values are: 0=circling, 1=strafing (preparing to shoot a fireball), 2=flying to the portal to land (part of transition to landed state), 3=landing on the portal (part of transition to landed state), 4=taking off from the portal (part of transition out of landed state), 5=landed, performing breath attack, 6=landed, looking for a player for breath attack, 7=landed, roar before beginning breath attack, 8=charging player, 9=flying to portal to die, 10=hovering with no AI (default when using the / summon command).\n\nDragon fireballs have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nEntity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all fireballs Tags common to all projectiles A dragon fireball spawned by a command (left) and the damage and the explosion it caused (right).\n\nThe / summon ender_dragon command, by default, summons a harmless ender dragon that hovers in place  [JE only ].\n\nSetting the DragonPhase tag (by issuing either the / summon ender_dragon ~ ~ ~ {DragonPhase:0} or the / data merge entity <selector> {DragonPhase:0} commands) starts the ender dragon's ordinary behavior, although the health bar does not appear because it is managed by the ender dragon fight status rather than by the dragon entity itself  [JE only ].\n\nIf spawned away from the center of the map (x=0, z=0), it flies to the center then resumes normal behavior (see #Behavior).\n\nTarget selectors for the ender dragon target a total of 9 entities per dragon, as the ender dragon actually consists of 9 entities internally [Java Edition only ].\n\nSo executing at a dragon to summon an arrow summons 9 arrows.\n\nThis section would benefit from the addition of more images.\n\nPlease remove this notice once you've added suitable images to the article.\n\nThe specific instructions are: Ender dragon

The Void does not affect ender dragons.\n\nIf low enough on health, the ender dragon emits beams of light without dying, as if cracked.\n\nName tags cannot be used on an ender dragon.\n\nThe ender dragon's hitbox, especially her wings, is unexpected larger than the ender dragon itself, causing players to be pushed away from her from farther away than usual.\n\nIf the player kills a summoned dragon in the Overworld or Nether, it does not create a portal or an egg.\n\nIn Spectator mode, the player cannot view the perspective of the ender dragon, unlike any other mob.\n\nHowever, it is possible through the use of commands (like / spectate).\n\nWhen this happens, the player's camera appears about 1 block over the dragon's body.\n\nUsing F3 + B  [JE only ] to show hitboxes reveals that the ender dragon's head rotation faces in the opposite direction to where its real head faces.\n\nThis is also why the ender dragon faces the wrong way when set in a monster spawner.\n\nWhen an ender dragon is spawned in the Overworld, it flies to coordinates X=0 and Z=0 and dives at the ground or does the same behavior as if in the End.\n\nIf end crystals are placed in the Overworld, they heal the dragon as normal, but it does not perch anywhere, and continues to fly around forever.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, there is an unused texture file for a dragon fireball item.\n\nIn Super Smash Bros.\n\nUltimate, one of the spirits that comes with the Steve/Alex DLC is the ender dragon.\n\nIt appears as a Legend-class \"spirit\" that makes the user breathe fire for a long time at the start of each battle.\n\nA wither that is summoned to battle the ender dragon cannot deal damage because the ender dragon flies too fast, and she is immune to projectiles when perching.\n\nIf commands or Creative mode are used to get end portal frames and eyes of ender, a player can basically skip to the end poem.\n\nIf a player destroys ender crystals or even hurts the dragon and then uses a player-made portal, upon returning, the player retains their progress. [BE only ] The end dragon has the longest death sound She is clearly biologically female because she can lay eggs.\n\n(It\u2019s best not to think about this too much with chickens and cows) On Reddit, Notch suggested the ender dragon's name to be \"Jean?\" in the same manner he called the player \"Steve?\".\n\n[6] Dinnerbone later stated that he thinks the name is officially \"Jean?\".\n\n[7] Despite this, an article on Minecraft.net states that \"uttering its true name would unleash a destructive force that would obliterate not only the End, but the Nether and the Overworld at the same time.\" [8] Notch referred to the ender dragon as a she on Reddit [citation needed ], the Xbox avatar item Ender Dragon Pet has the description \"A cuter, friendlier version of his bigger, less playful Minecraft sister,\" and the encyclopedia in Bedrock Edition refers to the dragon with feminine pronouns.\n\nhowever, it has been later confirmed by Notch, [9] Brandon Pearce [10] and Jeb [11] that all mobs in Minecraft have no gender, which would include ender dragon unless they don\u2019t count bosses.\n\nBefore she was textured, Notch reported that he was afraid to texture the ender dragon as she was a complicated model.\n\n[12] In the end, the dragon model was so complex Notch stated that he gave up making the texture manually and wrote a texture packer tool to aid him in adding the texture to the model.\n\nNotch also uploaded the code for the tool so others could use the pack.\n\n(Link to the texture packer) [13] Notch joked about how Minecraft was \"going next-gen\" when deadmau5 mentioned this.\n\n[14] Notch has uploaded a video showing why ender dragons do not spawn in the main world, as they would destroy any block they touch.\n\n[15] On Reddit, Notch explained that ender dragons destroy Overworld matter because \"trying to make an AI to properly navigate arbitrary terrain before the code freeze next tuesday [sic ] isn't feasible\".\n\n[16]

In Bedrock Edition, two ghasts can spawn within any 4 chunk span.\n\nGhasts do not spawn in nether fortresses, but they can wander nearby.\n\nGhast tear (0\u20131).\n\nLooting increases the maximum ghast tears dropped by one per level, for a maximum of 4 ghast tears with Looting III.\n\nGunpowder (0\u20132).\n\nLooting increases the maximum gunpowder dropped by one per level, for a maximum of 5 gunpowder with Looting III.\n\n5 when killed by the player.\n\nGhasts float around the Nether with their eyes and mouth closed and periodically make crying sounds, which can be heard from up to 80 blocks away.\n\nThey have a hitbox of 4\u00d74\u00d74 blocks, as well as nine tentacles that are not included in the hitbox.\n\nWhen within range, a ghast faces the player and shoots a fireball every 3 seconds, opening its eyes and mouth and making a screeching sound.\n\nA ghast requires a line of sight to the player before firing, which can be blocked by any solid block including transparent blocks.\n\nIn Java Edition, they target players within 64 blocks horizontally and 4 blocks vertically [1], and continue attacking as long as they are within a 64 block sphere and have line of sight.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a ghast normally targets a player within a sphere of 28 blocks, increasing to 64 blocks if the player damages it.\n\nGhasts can cause other mobs to attack them, but in Java Edition they never target other mobs, only the player.\n\nUnlike most other hostile mobs, ghasts do not attempt to approach the player once aggravated, but instead fire at the player from their position within firing range.\n\nWhen at close range, ghasts may take damage and die from their own fireball explosions.\n\nGhasts can be set on fire, but fire or lava does not harm them.\n\nWhen a ghast sinks into lava, or crosses a lava fall, its speed drops and it is immobilized for a while, making it more vulnerable to arrow shots.\n\nDespite their ghostly appearance, ghasts are not considered undead mobs.\n\n[2] This means they can drown, [3] are damaged by Instant Damage [4] and healed by Instant Health, are affected by Poison, [5] and are not affected by Smite.\n\n[6] Although they are not undead mobs, ghasts are never targeted by withers deliberately.\n\n[7] Despite that they are flying mobs, ghasts can destroy turtle eggs when on top of them.\n\n[8] Fireball Behavior Does not exist Details Size Height: JE: 1 Block BE: 0.31 blocks Width: JE: 1 Block BE: 0.31 blocks Main article: Fireball Ghasts shoot fireballs at players, dealing damage to nearby blocks and entities.\n\nJava Edition: Ghasts use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b c d MC-218108 \u2191 a b MC-177079 Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Main article: Entity format Ghasts have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nEntity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs ExplosionPower: The radius of the explosion created by the fireballs the ghast fires.\n\nDefault value is 1.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nFor historical information specifically pertaining to fireballs, see Fireball \u00a7 History.\n\nIssues relating to \"Ghast\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nIn English, \" ghast \" is an archaic word meaning \"ghastly\".\n\n[13] H.P.\n\nLovecraft first coined its use as the name for a monster (a vaguely humanoid one, in The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath), but \"ghasts\" have appeared in many other fantasy stories and games.\n\nThe player can go inside of a ghast by falling through the top of it or flying (or jumping while attacking) up underneath it.\n\nIf the player stands on top of the head, the player sees inside of it.\n\nIf a ghast is trapped in a 1-thick cube, it shoots fireballs through the cube.\n\nThis is because all mobs that shoot spawn the projectile one block in front of it to prevent the projectile from hitting the mob.\n\nOn rare occasions, ghasts spawn in such a way as to see through blocks (usually trapped on all sides in a tight area).\n\nWhen this happens and the ghast has a \"line of sight\" through those blocks, it launches a fireball in the player's direction.\n\nThis is reminiscent of a blaze but with explosive addition.\n\nC418 revealed in an AMA on Reddit that ghast sounds are taken from his pet cat, who makes them when disturbed while sleeping.\n\n[14] Two ghasts are featured in the LEGO set \"Minecraft Micro World - The Nether\", along with a Zombified Piglin.\n\nWhen killed with its own fireball, a ghast turns orange rather than red. [Bedrock Edition only ] Splash potions affect ghasts only when hitting their lower half.\n\nDespite not having visible feet, ghasts are still capable of making footstep sounds.\n\n[15] There is an unused ghast sound called \"affectionatescream.ogg\" in the game files.\n\nIt can be heard in the last scene of the Nether Update trailer.\n\nGhasts use different models between the Java Edition and Bedrock Edition, and some of their tentacles are different lengths.\n\nThey are one of the only mobs that the Zoglin does not attack.\n\nA ghast up close, shooting a fireball (with the old snowball texture) at the player.\n\nA ghast opens its red eyes when it spits out fireballs (note old \"expansion\" effect).\n\nAnother image of a shooting ghast (with the current textures).\n\nGhasts (note old snowball texture).\n\nA ghast that is in a nether fortress.\n\nA preview of three ghasts in the soul sand valley.\n\nA spawner programmed to spawn ghasts.\n\nPrior to 1.3, ghasts would slightly expand when shooting a fireball.\n\nA ghast flying through falling lava.\n\nA ghast in Pocket Edition.\n\nA ghast close to Sunny, showing how large they are compared to players.\n\nThe Secret Ghast, featured in the Trails & Tales Event.\n\nA Ghast in promotional artwork for the Nether Update.\n\nOfficial Ghast artwork.\n\nA Ghast, as it appears in Minecraft Story Mode.\n\nThe Giant Ghast, a unique variation featured in Minecraft Story Mode.\n\nA baby Ghast, as it appears in Minecraft Dungeons.\n\nGhast Spirit from Super Smash Bros.\n\nUltimate.\n\nGhast micromobs from LEGO Minecraft.\n\nLEGO Minecraft Ghast minifigure.\n\nOfficial T-shirt artwork \"Ghastbusters\" made by JINX.\n\nOfficial T-shirt artwork \"Glimpse\" made by JINX.\n\nOfficial T-shirt artwork \"Postcard\" made by JINX.\n\nOfficial T-shirt artwork \"Rumor Has It\" made by JINX.\n\nA glow in the dark Ghast T-Shirt.\n\nAn officially licensed Ghast hoodie.\n\nGhast plush made by JINX.\n\nAn official Ghast action figure.\n\n\"Never Trick or Treat in the Nether,\" an official tote bag sold for Halloween.\n\nA Ghast pictured in the Mobestiary.\n\nAn officially licensed Nerf Ghast gun.\n\n\u2191 a b MC-49640 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 MC-190140 \u2014 resolved as \"Invalid\".\n\n\u2191 MC-238622 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 MC-200929 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 MC-238623 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 MC-200937 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 MC-162557 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 MC-248332 \u2191 \"No it doesn't\" \u2013 @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X, April 1, 2011 \u2191 Minecraft Halloween Update hands-on; PC Gamer - October 29, 2010 \u2191 Hands-On With the Minecraft Halloween Update; Indie Games Plus - October 29, 2010 \u2191 Minecraft Halloween Update - Slipgate Adventures 2.avi; PC Gamer - October 29, 2010 \u2191 https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ghast \u2191 http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/nbe2h/i_am_the_composer_and_sound_designer_of_minecraft/c37sjyb \u2191 MC-92623 Meet the Ghast \u2013 Minecraft.net on May 22, 2017 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

[BE only ] This is a reference to the Party Parrot meme.\n\n[5] The game does not seem to have any real way to determine when the music ends, though; as long as the disc remains in the jukebox, the parrot continues dancing even after the music stops.\n\n[6] The dancing radius is 3 blocks from the jukebox.\n\nIf they dance and then fly beyond this radius, they stop dancing.\n\nA parrot does not dance if the music disc was inserted prior to it spawning, dismounting or being within the 3 blocks range.\n\n[7] Java Edition: Parrots use the \"friendly creatures\" sound category for

    "content": "For the mob in Minecraft Dungeons, see MCD:Phantom.\n\nPhantom Phantom Phantom (BE) Health 20 \u00d7 10 Classification Undead Behavior Hostile Spawn In the Overworld at nighttime or during thunderstorms, when player has not entered a bed for at least 3 ingame days.\n\nDamage Java Edition: Easy & Normal: 2 Hard: 3 Bedrock Edition: Easy: 4 Normal: 6 Hard: 9 Details Size Height: 0.5 Blocks Width: 0.9 Blocks Phantoms are flying undead hostile mobs that spawn in the night sky when the player has not laid in a bed or died for three or more in-game days.\n\nThey attack by diving at the player from the sky to bite them.\n\nUsually, they appear in trios.\n\nTwo phantoms at night.\n\nPhantoms spawn unless the game rule doInsomnia is set to false.\n\nThe spawning mechanics differ between Java and Bedrock editions.\n\nIn both editions, they spawn in the Overworld above the player if the \"Time Since Last Rest\" statistic is at least 1 hour (72000 ticks or 3 in-game days).\n\n[verify ] This statistic is reset when the player dies or enters a bed.\n\nFurthermore, the player must not have a block overhead that blocks light in any way; for example, leaves prevent phantoms from spawning as they have a light opacity of 2, but glass does not, as its light opacity is 0.\n\nPhantoms do not spawn in Spectator mode, [JE only ] but they do spawn in Creative mode.\n\n[1] Phantom spawning is similar to other monsters spawning: the spawn location must have a light level of 7 or less, and spawns are limited by the monster population cap.\n\nPhantoms are also subject to a density cap of 5.\n\nPhantom spawn attempts are made on surface blocks throughout the same spawn radius as other monsters.\n\nHowever, when a phantom spawn attempt succeeds the phantom appears somewhere in a 21\u00d715\u00d721 cube centered 28 blocks above the player instead of at the block where the spawn attempt occurred.\n\nPhantoms attempt to spawn every 1\u20132 minutes.\n\nThey spawn only if it is night or a thunderstorm is happening, the player is above sea level (y=64) with sky access, and the local difficulty is greater than a randomly chosen value between 0.0 and 3.0.\n\nThe chance of a successful spawn is x \u221272000 \u2044 x, where x is the number of ticks since the player last entered a bed or died.\n\nThis roughly comes to a 1 \u2044 4 (25.0%) chance on day 4, a 2 \u2044 5 (40.0%) chance on day 5, a 3 \u2044 6 (1 \u2044 2) (50.0%) chance on day 6, 4 \u2044 7 (about 57.1%) chance on day 7, and so on.\n\nIf all conditions are met, a group of phantoms attempt to spawn 20\u201334 blocks above the player, and off to the side by a taxicab distance of up to 10 blocks.\n\nThe number of phantoms spawned is 1-2 in Easy difficulty, 1-3 in Normal, and 1-4 in Hard.\n\nPhantoms can spawn inside buildings, if the player is outside and the building is both near enough and the building has a large enough cavity for them to spawn inside.\n\nPhantoms are counted toward the hostile mob cap, but they don't adhere to it when spawning.\n\n[2] Their spawning mechanic is based on the location of players in the world rather than by chance, unlike regular mob spawning.\n\nPhantom spawning is completely independent of the biome, meaning they can spawn in biomes that normally prevent hostile mob spawning such as mushroom fields [3] and the void [4].\n\nPhantoms increase in number every consecutive night a player hasn't entered a bed and stop spawning when the player lies down in bed.\n\nPhantoms drop when killed: 0\u20131 phantom membrane s when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nLooting increases the maximum drops by 1 per level, for a maximum of 4 with Looting III.\n\n5 when killed by the player or a tamed wolf.\n\nA phantom swooping at the player.\n\nWhen idle, phantoms fly around in a roughly circular pattern within 15 to 25 blocks of a player horizontally and within 24 to 35 blocks of a player vertically, leaving a trail of gray smoke while doing so.\n\nTheir movement speed is one of the fastest of any mob, up to 20 blocks per second.\n\nThey have a large search radius, targeting and following players from 64 blocks away [BE only ] [more information needed ].\n\nOnce every 10-20 seconds [BE only ] [more information needed ] they swoop down or up quickly to attack.\n\nIf stopped or hurt during this action, the phantom retreats back to its original elevation.\n\nWhen a path to its original elevation is obstructed by a block, the phantom continues attempting to return to its original elevation until it either attacks or moves out from under the block.\n\nPhantoms do not attack an exposed player sleeping in a bed.\n\nPhantoms can move through water at their normal speed.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a phantom underwater attempts to fly to the surface, and dies from drowning after 20 seconds if trapped underwater.\n\nPhantoms do not drown in Java Edition.\n\nA phantom's body disappears when under the Invisibility effect, but its eyes and smoke particles are still visible.\n\nCats hiss at phantoms that are currently attacking players, and phantoms try to stay at least 64 blocks away from them.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, phantoms also avoid ocelots in the same manner.\n\nLike other undead mobs, phantoms are harmed by the Instant Health effect, healed by the Instant Damage effect, immune to the Poison and Regeneration effects, ignored by the wither, and affected by the Smite enchantment.\n\nLike zombies and skeletons, phantoms burn in sunlight.\n\nThey burn even when equipped with helmets through commands.\n\n[5] Java Edition: Phantoms use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition:

always have a constant 20 \u00d7 10 HP, and deal 6 + Size damage.\n\nNaturally spawned phantoms are always size 0.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Phantom\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe red phantom design was scrapped because it looked like a Nether mob.\n\nAt one point before the release of 18w10a, the phantom texture was made red, but it was decided that it appeared too much like a Nether mob.\n\n[8] The phantom was originally going to have a mouth, like the drawing shown during MINECON Earth, but it was eventually scrapped because \"it looked so much like a muppet\".\n\n[8] Earlier designs can be seen on Minecraft 's Instagram account.\n\n[9] The sounds of the phantom were taken from Samuel \u00c5berg 's baby son screaming.\n\n[10] Despite that they are flying mobs, phantoms can destroy turtle eggs when on top of them.\n\n[11] The game rule that modify Phantom spawning

[Java Edition only ] When spawned, the wither grows larger in size as its health bar fills up.\n\nWhile in this state, the wither is invulnerable, and neither moves nor attacks.\n\nWhen this state ends (after 11 seconds), the wither creates a large explosion centered on itself, destroying nearby blocks and dealing up to 68 \u00d7 34 damage to nearby mobs and players, depending on difficulty.\n\nThis explosion has a blast power of 7, more than that of a charged creeper or an end crystal.\n\nIt is accompanied by a loud gruesome sound that can be heard equally from across the map and in all dimensions [JE only ].\n\n[1] After this, the wither attacks nearby mobs and can take damage.\n\nThe wither has the greatest natural health of all mobs in Minecraft (exceeded by the warden, while Bedrock Edition 's wither still has the highest health), at 300 \u00d7 150 in Java Edition or 600 \u00d7 300 in Bedrock Edition.\n\nThe wither is immune to fire, lava, drowning damage, and freezing.\n\nLike other undead mobs, the wither is harmed by the Instant Health effect and healed by the Instant Damage effect as well as affected by weapons with the Smite enchantment.\n\nIt is immune to all other status effects, like the ender dragon.\n\nUpon taking damage, the wither breaks all blocks within a 3\u00d74\u00d73 area around it, including blast-resistant blocks like obsidian, crying obsidian, and ancient debris, dropping them as items if possible.\n\nThe wither is the only mob in the game that can destroy obsidian.\n\nThe wither cannot break the following blocks: Barrier Bedrock End Portal End Portal Frame End Gateway Command Block Structure Block Jigsaw Block Light Block Moving Piston Moving Block  [Bedrock Edition only ] Reinforced Deepslate In Java Edition, these blocks are listed under the wither_immune tag.\n\nThe wither attacking a villager.\n\nThe wither's block-breaking behavior makes suffocation ineffective under most circumstances.\n\nHowever, the blocks listed above, as well as some natural structures that include them, can be used to suffocate the wither due to their wither immunity.\n\nThe wither is hostile toward all mobs except: Undead mobs Zombies and their variants Skeletons and their variants Zombified piglin s Skeleton horse s and zombie horse s Phantom Zoglin Other withers Ghast s [2] Mobs with the Invulnerable NBT tag.\n\nIf the wither is idle, it simply hovers and is unable to gain altitude.\n\nOn Normal or Hard difficulty, it fires blue skulls in random directions until it finds a target.\n\nThe wither's boss health bar color depends on the edition: Dark purple on Java Edition, or pink on Bedrock Edition.\n\nIt appears only when a player is looking in the wither's direction, including through walls.\n\nAll withers display a boss bar on the screen.\n\nRenamed withers display the changed name above its boss bar.\n\nThe sky darkens when the wither spawns (a kind of fog).\n\nWither with 'wither armor' effect, after half health depleted.\n\nUpon noticing a mob, the wither hovers above it and rapidly shoots black wither skulls.\n\nEach head fires independently, allowing a wither to attack up to three different mobs/ players at the same time.\n\nThe main head controls the wither's movement and has a 0.1% chance to shoot a blue wither skull instead of the default black one.\n\nWhenever a wither kills another mob, a wither rose is planted if the ground is grass block, dirt, coarse dirt, moss block, mud, netherrack, soul sand, or soul soil on Java Edition, or otherwise dropped as an item at that mob's location; however, it may be destroyed by other wither skulls.\n\nWither roses are planted/dropped even when the game rule doMobLoot is set to false.\n\n[3] The wither has a passive regeneration rate of 1 every 20 ticks (1 second), and a direct killing blow on a target instantly heals 5.\n\nWhen its health drops below half (150 \u00d7 75), the wither gains a natural \"wither armor\" effect, which makes it immune to damage from arrows and thrown tridents and causes it to fly at the same height as the target.\n\nThe armor disappears if it regenerates above half health.\n\nUpon noticing a player or mob, the wither flies to a random location and hovers in place.\n\nIt shoots 3 black wither skulls and one blue wither skull before flying to another location.\n\nThe time between each shot decreases as the wither loses health.\n\nOn Normal difficulty or higher, if the wither has targeted an entity but cannot find a location to pathfind to, it shoots random blue skulls in a random direction along with the skulls directed toward the target.\n\nWhen a wither reaches halfway of its total health, it causes a large explosion that spawns 3 wither skeletons (except on Easy difficulty), as well as gaining wither armor.\n\nInstead of flying to a random location, it dashes toward its target, destroying blocks and damaging mobs in its path.\n\nIt also fires up to 4 skulls per burst: three black skulls followed by one blue skull.\n\nIt has different spawn and death animations, both of which involve the wither exploding.\n\nWither roses always drop as an item when the wither kills a mob.\n\nWither roses are dropped even when the game rule doMobLoot is set to false.\n\n[4] The wither rose inflicts the Wither effect for a couple of seconds when stepped on.\n\nThe sky light level drops to 11 and dark clouds appear from the moment the wither spawns until it is dead, preventing zombies, skeletons, and drowned from burning in sunlight.\n\nOn Easy difficulty, the wither does not inflict the wither effect or summon wither skeletons.\n\nWithers will retain their anti-projectile armor after healing it over 1/2 of its total HP (301 \u00d7 150.5), though it disappears after the game is restarted.\n\n[5] Not to be confused with Wither Skeleton Skull.\n\nWither Skull Normal Dangerous Behavior Does not exist Details Size Height: 0.3125 Blocks Width: 0.3125 Blocks When attacking, the wither rapidly fires explosive projectiles called wither skulls, which look like its own heads, at its target.\n\nThere are two types of wither skulls: a fast-moving black one, and a slower blue one.\n\nBlack wither skulls explode with a blast power of 1, the same as a ghast 's fireball, and cannot break blocks with a blast resistance above 4.\n\nBlue wither skulls have the same explosion strength, but move slower and are more destructive to terrain.\n\nBlue wither skulls break all breakable blocks (including obsidian, ancient debris, and blocks of netherite), but cannot break unbreakable blocks like bedrock, end portal frames, and reinforced deepslate.\n\nIn Minecraft Education, blue wither skulls deal increased damage, but with the same explosion radius.\n\nIf either type of wither skull hits a player or mob, it does 8 damage on Normal difficulty.\n\nIt also inflicts Wither II for 10 seconds on Normal difficulty and 40 seconds on Hard, which turns the player's hearts black () and drains health, similarly to Poison.\n\nHowever, unlike Poison, it can kill the player.\n\nLike other status effects, the Wither effect can be cured by drinking milk.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition and Legacy Console Edition, the blue skull can be deflected by hitting it with an empty hand, weapon, tool, or throwable projectiles such as tridents, arrows, snowballs, and throwable potions.\n\nJava Edition: Withers use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nWither skulls use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 MC-212623 \u2191 Does not trigger at all if the gamerule globalSoundEvents is false \u2191 MC-177741 Bedrock Edition: \u2191 Is normally 1.0, but can be 0.75

Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Wither\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe painting depicting how to spawn a wither According to Jeb, the wither was inspired by Terraria, which has a summonable boss mechanic.\n\nThe name itself is inspired by a poison spell in another game made by Jeb called Whispers in Akarra.\n\n[10] There is a painting showing the soul sand and wither skeleton skull formation needed to spawn a wither.\n\nIf the wither is damaged by the Void, it frantically attempts to fire blue skulls.\n\nAbove half health, the wither always attempts to stay a few blocks above the mob it is targeting.\n\nThis means that attempting to build or climb up to hit the wither using a sword is essentially impossible.\n\nIf the wither is after a blaze and the blaze tries to fly up to it, the wither attempts to keep rising above the blaze, thus making both of them rise higher until they hit a ceiling or until the blaze despawns or dies.\n\nAlthough the wither is 3.5 blocks tall, 3 blocks wide, and 1 block thick, its hitbox is only 3.5 blocks tall, 1 block wide, and 1 block thick.\n\nThe true dimensions of the wither are: 2.844 blocks tall (varies), 3 blocks wide, and 1.719 blocks long (also varies).\n\nThe wither appears on the four sides of chiseled red sandstone.\n\nThe wither's smaller heads shoot targets slightly slower than the main head.\n\nThe interval for smaller heads is 2\u20133 seconds, while the main head's always 2.\n\nAn enemy called the wither storm appears in Minecraft: Story Mode.\n\nIt was created by replacing the center block of soul sand with a command block.\n\nDespite not having visible feet, withers are still capable of making footstep sounds.\n\n[11] In Java Edition 3D Shareware v1.34, withers drop red keys.\n\nAccording to Quinn Richter, Marketplace Partner Manager, the wither's name is \"Simmons?\", similar to the ender dragon's name being \"Jean?\".\n\n[12] A wither skull can be deflected by shooting an arrow at it. [Bedrock Edition only ] If a deflected wither skull hits the wither, the wither takes damage. [Bedrock Edition only ] A wither and an ender dragon can engage in combat, but neither one damages the other.\n\nDespite being immune to projectiles when it has \"wither armor\", it is still able to be hit by the warden 's sonic boom attack.\n\nThis is because the warden's sonic boom attack is not a projectile, but an instant damage attack.\n\nTherefore, the wither is unable to defend against it with the \"armor\".\n\nThe withering effect after being damaged by a wither skull.\n\nThe \"wither armor\" that blocks arrows.\n\nThe wither and its armor.\n\nA larger image to show how to summon the wither.\n\nThe wither prepares for explosion with the invulnerable status after summoned.\n\nThe pit created after the wither has charged.\n\nThe wither attacking horses.\n\nThe wither's texture.\n\nWither attacking a sheep.\n\nWither attacking a village.\n\nA wither summoning setup.\n\nImage from Dinnerbone of a wither being built horizontally.\n\nA player avoiding a wither by using the Invisibility effect.\n\nFirst image of a wither being built in Bedrock Edition.\n\nWither in promotional artwork for the Pretty Scary Update.\n\nWither Storm, a variant of Wither as it appears on Minecraft: Story Mode.\n\nWither pictured in the Mobestiary.\n\nLEGO Minecraft wither.\n\n\"Acid Wither,\" an official T-Shirt design.\n\n\"Jolly Mobs Flying Head,\" another T-Shirt design.\n\nEnder dragon, the other boss mob in Minecraft Tutorials/Defeating the wither, a tutorial explaining different tactics to fight and kill the wither \u2191 MC-177741 \u2014 Wither sounds play for all players \u2191 MC-162557 \u2014 \"Withers no longer attack ghasts\" \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 MC-154922 \u2191 MCPE-73842 \u2191 MCPE-161643 \u2013 After healing a wither boss over 1/2 HP, it still retains its anti-projectile shield \u2191 \"Minecraft 1.4 - How to Spawn Wither Mob - Mojang PAX 2012 Live @ 3:07\" \u2013 Accelerated Ideas on YouTube \u2191 http://www.twitch.tv/pax2/b/330745811 (at 3:57:47) \u2191 MC-29274 \u2191 MC-189872 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 https://minecraft.net/article/meet-wither \u2191 MC-92623 \u2191 \"Ask Mojang #4: To The Moon!\n\n@ 3:40\" \u2013 Minecraft on YouTube, November 8, 2019 Meet the Wither \u2013 Minecraft.net on February 13, 2017 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

[Java Edition only ] A blaze flies when it acquires a target, slowly approaching while attempting to remain from 0.5 to 3.5 blocks above the target.\n\nA blaze's normal attack is a trio of small fireballs, shot from up to 48 blocks [Java Edition only ] or 16 blocks. [Bedrock Edition only ] A blaze shoots only when it has a clear line of sight to its target.\n\nIf line of sight is broken in the middle of its volley, the blaze suspends the remainder of its volley until line of sight returns.\n\nWhen using this attack, the blaze burns with fire for 3 seconds, shoots three small fireballs over the course of 0.9 seconds, then extinguishes its flames and waits for 5 seconds before attacking again.\n\nA blaze shoots its small fireballs with roughly the same lack of accuracy as a dispenser; however, the blaze's shots maintain the same speed all the way to the target, unlike the dispenser's, which start slow and accelerate.\n\nA blaze that touches its target performs a melee attack that does 6 damage on normal difficulty, once per second.\n\nThis attack is not considered fire damage and does not ignite the target.\n\nThis cannot be prevented by the Fire Resistance status effect.\n\nJava Edition: Blazes use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Main article: Entity format Blazes have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nEntity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nFor information specifically pertaining to small fireballs, see Small Fireball \u00a7 History.\n\nIssues relating to \"Blaze\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nBlazes can see the player through walls.\n\nWhen throwing a potion of Invisibility on a blaze, the smoke remains visible.\n\nAccording to Jens Bergensten, blazes look the way they do because all mobs in Minecraft are cuboid-shape, so to make them flame-like and magical, he created them as a core surrounded by rotating rods.\n\n[3] Blazes originally didn't have eyes when Jens Bergensten was first creating them and \"just looked like a yellow rock\".\n\nEyes were added to \"give it more personality\".\n\n[4] Despite not having visible feet, blazes are still capable of making footstep sounds.\n\n[5] According to Minecraft's \"Visit the Nether!\" blazes are sentient beings made of pure lava.\n\nThe article theorizes they were created by the original inhabitants of nether fortresses to serve as guards, but their creators lost control over the blazes and were subsequently destroyed by them.\n\n[6] On the official T-shirt \"Alchemy\" by JINX, the blaze is in the form of the Vitruvian Man and the text uses the Standard Galactic Alphabet.\n\nThe words on the outside of the ring translate to: \"nigredo\", \"albedo\", \"citrinitas\", and \"rubedo\" [note 1] which are all relating to magnum opus.\n\nThe words on the ring translate to (starting from the top): \"B * Crowmer\", \"poison * speed\", \"strenth * resist\" [sic ], \"vision * heal\", and \"regeneration\" relating to potions and probably the artist's name.\n\nOn the connecting lines the words translate to: \"potln of thickness\" [sic ], \"potln of awkward\" [sic ], \"weakness potion\" and \"mundane potion\" relating to base potions.\n\nAs part of an official collaboration, blazes are included as monsters in a free add-on for the roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n[7] In the game, they are \"Elementals\" and have the alignment \"Typically Neutral Evil\".\n\nA close up look at a blaze spawner in a Nether fortress.\n\nZoomed out view of the blaze spawner, showing the spawner area and a spawned blaze.\n\nMultiple blazes shooting small fireballs at the player as they hover around their spawner.\n\nA Blaze that was spawned in the Overworld is taking damage from snowy weather.\n\n(Before 20w06a) Disabling a blaze spawner with 9 glowstone blocks.\n\nGlowstone can be replaced with other light sources of light level 15.\n\nA triggered blaze preparing to attack who still hasn't flown.\n\nA triggered blaze preparing to attack with fire around it, floating on the wall of a Nether fortress.\n\nA blaze and a wither skeleton idling in a Nether fortress.\n\nTwo blazes spawned near a blaze spawner and a wither skeleton.\n\nBlazes spawned by a spawner.\n\nA blaze spawner platform with blazes.\n\nA blaze without particles.\n\nThe Blaze as it appears in Minecraft: Story Mode.\n\nThe Blaze as it appears in Minecraft Dungeons.\n\nOfficial LEGO Blaze minifigure.\n\nOfficial T-shirt artwork \"Alchemy\" featuring a blaze.\n\nMade by JINX.\n\nOfficial blaze statistics for D&D.\n\n\u2191 There is a nether track titled Rubedo.\n\n\u2191 https://youtu.be/enIW9AJ1Zxk \u2191 MC-194697 \u2191 https://minecraft.net/en-us/article/meet-blaze \u2191 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3TXUTLClb0&t=0s \u2191 MC-92623 \u2191 \"Visit the Nether!\" by Duncan Geere.\n\nMinecraft.net, November 10, 2019 \u2191 https://www.dndbeyond.com/claim/source/minecraft-creatures-monstrous-compendium Meet the Blaze \u2013 Minecraft.net on December 20, 2016 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

[JE only ] Creepers flee from ocelots and cats within a 6-block radius, with faster movement than when pursuing a player.\n\nCats and ocelots do not attack creepers.\n\nA creeper that has begun a detonation does not flee unless the player leaves its blast radius.\n\nCreepers are not targeted by tamed wolves, iron golems or zoglins.\n\nHowever, they are still attacked by withers, snow golems, [2] vindicators named \"Johnny\", wardens and goats.\n\nWhen hit by a stray projectile (like a drowned 's trident), a creeper retaliates if not already chasing a player, unless said projectile is a skeleton's arrow.\n\nWhen attacked by a goat, or poisoned by a pufferfish, a creeper does not retaliate.\n\nIf a creeper is attacked by any other mob, the creeper moves toward the mob that attacked it and explodes.\n\nWhen a creeper is inflicted with a status effect, its explosion creates an area effect cloud of the effect. [JE only ] Two creepers' explosion damage radius in the dirt.\n\nComparison between a charged creeper's (left) and a normal creeper's (right).\n\nNotice that the charged creeper's explosion is much bigger than the normal creeper's explosion.\n\nA charged creeper has a significantly increased explosion power.\n\nA charged creeper is created only when lightning strikes within four blocks of a normal creeper.\n\nThe lightning can be created in any way, including naturally, with the / summon command, by a trident with the Channeling enchantment, or attracted to a lightning rod.\n\nCharged creepers are distinguished from normal creepers by the blue aura surrounding them.\n\nIn Java Edition, a charged creeper can be summoned with the following command: /summon creeper ~ ~ ~ {powered:1} In Bedrock Edition, a charged creeper can be summoned by: /summon creeper ~ ~ ~ minecraft:become_charged Their countdown timers are the same as normal creepers, both in terms of range and time.\n\nWith a power of 6, an explosion caused by a charged creeper is twice as powerful as the explosion caused by a creeper.\n\nCharged creepers' explosions are 50% more powerful than an explosion of TNT.\n\nHow close the creeper was to the lightning strike does not affect the size or power of the explosion.\n\nCharged creepers have the same entity ID as normal creepers.\n\nThe only difference is that the value of the boolean powered tag is set to 1 (true).\n\nIn Java Edition, a charged creeper explosion that kills zombies, skeletons, wither skeletons, piglins, or other creepers causes one [3] of those mobs to drop its corresponding mob head.\n\nIf multiple valid mobs are killed in the explosion, the one that drops a head is chosen at random.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a charged creeper explosion that kills zombies, skeletons, wither skeletons, or other creepers causes all the killed mobs to drop their corresponding heads.\n\nA charged creeper does not drop its own head when it

which were bright shades of green, but has since been changed.\n\nIn multiplayer, if a creeper is attacked by another player, and the other player runs out of sight, it does not attack any other players.\n\nWhen asked how creepers trigger their explosive nature, Dinnerbone said \"They're so nervous that they shake a lot, and then this sets them off the same way as how rubbing two sticks makes fire\".\n\n[11] If a charged creeper is given Invisibility, the \"aura\" effect is still visible.\n\nA charged creeper explosion can inflict the greatest amount of damage any mob in the game can do at one time.\n\nThe creeper hiss sound uses the same sound file as when a block of TNT is primed but played at a lower pitch.\n\nCreepers have a formidable reputation in the community because of their potential to hurt or kill even veteran players and destroy structures.\n\nTheir distinct appearance and destructive abilities have made them a widely recognizable Minecraft icon.\n\nCreepers are referenced in several of the items available at the Minecraft merchandise depot, [12] and have become an internet meme complete with fan art, webcomic references, and demotivational posters.\n\nA central part of the meme is the creeper's unofficial catchphrase derived from the mob's tendency to sneak up on the player and hiss before detonating: \" That'sssss a very nice <random valuable object> you've got there...\n\nIt'd be a ssssshame if anything were to happen to it...\n\n\" [13] Moe Szyslak took the appearance of a creeper and exploded in the Simpsons\u2019 home within the 17th episode of season 25.\n\nCreepers have been portrayed in many Minecraft products including but not limited to: The letter \"A\" in the Minecraft logo after Java Edition Beta 1.4 (The previous logo was

is seen on a shelf in the grocery store along with 2 Pickaxes and some grass blocks.\n\nIt is part of a collection known as \"Mintcraft\".\n\nIn Awesomenauts, one of the playable characters (Clunk) has a \"skin\" referencing the creeper, complete with hissing and exploding sound effects.\n\nA creeper can be seen and interacted with in a level from the game McPixel.\n\nSeen as a Halloween costume in the 2D action-adventure, open-world sandbox / platformer game, Terraria.\n\nIn Evoland 2, a game designed as a tribute to many classic games, \"Dreaded Creepers\" can be found as a mob in The Mine, present era.\n\nIf the player gets killed by a Dreaded Creeper, they unlock the sssSSSSSss BOOM!\n\nachievement.\n\nThe Creeper makes various appearances in the crossover fighting game Super Smash Bros.\n\nUltimate, as it appears as a DLC costume for the Mii Brawler, It also appears as a \"spirit\", and they also appear in Steve's Final Smash, the House of Boom.\n\nFlash games In Stealing the Diamond (The Henry Stickmin Collection), when Henry Stickmin sneaks up to the museum's outer wall and attempts to mine it with a pickaxe, a creeper suddenly comes up behind him and explodes,

    "content": "This article is a work in progress.\n\nPlease help in the expansion or creation of this article by expanding or improving it.\n\nThe talk page may contain suggestions.\n\nNote: Add the Elder Guardian Ghost render.\n\nThis article is about the mob in the base game.\n\nFor the mob in Minecraft Dungeons, see:MCD:Elder Guardian.\n\nElder Guardian Elder Guardian Retracted Health 80 \u00d7 40 Classification Aquatic Behavior Hostile Damage Laser: Easy: 5 Normal: 8 Hard: 12 \u00d7 6 Spikes: Easy and Normal: 2 Hard: 3 Details Size Height: 1.9975 Blocks Width: 1.9975 Blocks An elder guardian is a stronger and larger variant of the guardian, and the largest aquatic mob.\n\nIt attacks the same way as a normal guardian, but also applies Mining Fatigue to players in a large radius around itself.\n\nThey are only found in ocean monuments; three of them generate in each one.\n\nThree elder guardians spawn naturally during the generation of each ocean monument: one in the top room of the monument and the other two in each wing section of the monument.\n\nThey do not respawn after their initial spawn, thus there are a limited number of them per world.\n\nHowever, they may be squished to death for some reasons, reducing the number available on the monument Elder guardians drop the following items: 0\u20132 prismarine shard s \u2013 always.\n\nAffected by Looting: 1 more drop per level, for a maximum of 5.\n\n1 wet sponge \u2013 when killed by the player.\n\nNot affected by Looting.\n\n20% chance to drop a tide armor trim smithing template, unaffected by Looting.\n\nOne of the following: 1 \u2044 2 chance: a raw cod (cooked cod if killed by fire [JE only ]).\n\nAffected by Looting: 0\u20131 more drops per level, for a maximum of 4.\n\n1 \u2044 3 chance: prismarine crystals.\n\nAffected by Looting: 0\u20131 more drops per level, for a maximum of 4.\n\n1 \u2044 6 chance: no drop.\n\n2.5% chance: a random fish.\n\nAffected by Looting: 1% more chance per level, for a maximum of 5.5% with Looting III.\n\nThis drop uses the same chances that fishing uses, resulting in a 60% chance for raw cod, a 25% chance for raw salmon, a 13% chance for pufferfish, and a 2% chance for tropical fish.\n\n10 \u2013 when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nThis section would benefit from the addition of more images.\n\nPlease remove this notice once you've added suitable images to the article.\n\nThe specific instructions are: Animated images of the elder guardian cursing effect, distinct ones for java and bedrock due to animation differences Elder guardians do not swim around as much as normal guardians.\n\nElder guardians do not swim away when approached by a player it is targeting, unlike regular guardians.\n\nLike normal guardians, elder guardians attempt to attack both the player and squid.\n\nThe elder guardian's eye follows and stares at any nearby players, and always looks directly at its target.\n\nThe eye still follows a player under the effects of Invisibility or in Spectator mode, but doesn't attack.\n\nElder guardian are considered aquatic mobs, and thus are affected by the Impaling enchantment.\n\n [Java Edition only ]  [until JE Combat Tests ] The elder guardian has three methods of attacking, including firing its laser, inflicting Mining Fatigue, and a defensive thorn-like attack.\n\nThe elder guardian pathfinds toward an ocean monument if it is not within one.\n\nAn elder guardian attacks axolotls that are not playing dead.\n\nOtherwise, an elder guardian does not attack mobs (such as iron golems) that attack it, although the attacking mob takes damage from the elder guardian's natural spikes defense.\n\nLaser The laser takes several seconds to charge, doing no damage and allowing the player to move away in the meantime.\n\nAs it charges it turns from purple to bright yellow (thus acting as a warning indicator).\n\nOnce charged, the beam flashes green, abruptly ends, and deals 12 \u00d7 6 damage on Hard difficulty.\n\nThe elder guardian swims around for a few seconds before firing again.\n\nThe beam cannot be dodged and has a maximum range of approximately 14 blocks.\n\nOnce the player is out of range, if the beam is obstructed by solid blocks, or if the player has a shield, the guardian's beam disengages from the player and deals no damage.\n\n[more information needed ] In Java Edition, immediately after spawning and once each minute thereafter, the elder guardian searches for any player within a spherical radius of 50 blocks to afflict with Mining Fatigue III.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition the elder guardian inflicts any unafflicted player within range immediately.\n\nWhen afflicted, the player sees a ghostly image of the elder guardian and hears a ghostly noise.\n\nThe effect decreases a player's attack speed by 30% and decreases mining speed even more for 5 minutes.\n\nThe attack targets players through blocks, even underground, and a potion of Invisibility offers no defense.\n\nThis is not considered an attack in regards to the Thorns enchantment.\n\nThe image of the elder guardian is a particle effect that can be recreated by issuing the command / particle minecraft:elder_guardian. [Java Edition only ] An elder guardian deals 2 (3 on Hard mode) of damage every time it is hit while its spikes are extended, similar to the Thorns enchantment on armor.\n\nIf cornered by a player or axolotl, the elder guardian usually extends its spikes and fires at point-blank range.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition.\n\nThe elder guardian ghost flying.\n\nThe elder guardian ghost is an unused mob added in beta 1.13.0.4.\n\nIts file isn't included in the behavior pack, and it can be spawned only by using the command / summon elder_guardian_ghost ~ ~ ~.\n\nThe elder guardian ghost has defensive spikes.\n\nThe elder guardian ghost has the same model and texture as the elder guardian, but uses the player hurt sound, has less health, and is missing the back tail model.\n\nWhen spawned outside of water, it floats upward until it despawns, similar to a mob tied to a balloon, or under a high level of levitation effect, but it passes through blocks.\n\nThe elder guardian ghost itself isn't immune to suffocation damage, and drops only experience.\n\nIt behaves similar to custom mobs added in behavior packs with broken AI; the mobs float upward and pass through blocks when hit.\n\nIf an elder guardian ghost is spawned underwater, it slowly sinks downward, passing through all blocks (including bedrock), until it eventually it falls into the void and dies.\n\nWhen underwater, the elder guardian ghost can rotate its body, look at players, and swim while slowly sinking downward.\n\nJava Edition: Elder guardians use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 Increases quadratically from minimum to maximum as the attack goes on \u2191 Increases linearly from minimum to maximum as the attack goes on Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Elder guardians have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Elder Guardian\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe elder guardian's eye is the \"head\" part of the mob 's model, giving the illusion of a dynamic eye.\n\nThe elder guardian texture has the name \"jeb\" on it.\n\nAccording to Jeb, elder guardians were introduced to encourage players to solve the temple maze rather than dig through it easily.\n\nHe acknowledges there are ways around it, but players still have to solve the challenge in a different way.\n\n[4] Also according to Jeb, the \"jump scare\" by an elder guardian is unintentional, instead, he added it to provide a visual cue as to why players get slowed down by Mining Fatigue.\n\n[4] In Java Edition 3D Shareware v1.34, elder guardians drop blue keys.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, elder guardians make their underwater death sounds if killed on land.\n\nThey also, like guardians, don't make flopping sounds on Bedrock Edition.\n\nThe elder guardian was once referred to as a \u201cboss\u201d by Mojang.\n\nThis means depending on how you see it, it could be the third boss as well as the two official bosses.\n\nA special effect of the elder guardian, which gives Mining Fatigue III for 5 minutes.\n\nThe elder guardian's Mining Fatigue effect.\n\nAn elder guardian spawned inside an ocean monument.\n\nAn elder guardian spreading its spikes.\n\nAn elder guardian's laser.\n\nAn elder guardian in full view.\n\nThe inside of an elder guardian (spikes retracted).\n\nSize comparison between an elder and a normal guardian.\n\nThe elder guardian curse ghastly image shows the elder guardian's full model.\n\nA group of axolotls attacking an elder guardian.\n\nA player avoiding an elder guardian by using the Invisibility effect.\n\nA player avoiding an elder guardian by using the Invisibility effect.\n\nAn elder guardian in promotional artwork for the Boss Update.\n\nMinecraft Mobestiary 's page about elder guardians.\n\nLego Minecraft elder guardian.\n\nNarrator and MARILLA attempting to battle an Elder Guardian.\n\n\u2191 MC-57057 \u2014 Guardian laser attack sound ignores distance \u2191 MC-92294 \u2191 http://www.mojang.com/2016/08/sneak-peek-boss-update-is-coming-to-pocket-and-windows-10/ [dead link ] \u2191 a b https://minecraft.net/en-us/article/block-week-prismarine Meet the Elder Guardian \u2013 Minecraft.net on November 6, 2017 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

[Java Edition only ] She cannot be damaged at just any spot in this large volume: eight green sub- hitboxes are also shown, which indicate the locations where the dragon can take damage: The tail, body, head, and wings.\n\nThe ender dragon is a flying mob, which cannot actually stand on the ground.\n\nShe flies around the end main island while fighting the player.\n\nThe dragon can pass through all blocks, destroying almost all types, but can still be affected by flowing water, lava and bubble column.\n\nBlocks not destroyed are those that naturally generate on the central End island and those that are intended to be indestructible, such as end stone and respawn anchors: Barrier Bedrock Command Block Crying Obsidian End stone End portal (block) End portal frame End gateway (block) Fire Iron bars Light Block Obsidian Reinforced Deepslate Respawn Anchor Structure Block In Java Edition, these blocks are marked under the dragon_immune tag, with the exception of light blocks and fire, which are marked as dragon_transparent.\n\nDestroyed blocks are not dropped, although containers (such as chests and dispensers, but not shulker boxes) drop their contents.\n\nThe dragon \"bathing\" endermen with its toxic breath attack.\n\nThe dragon never targets any entity but the player, although other mobs may turn hostile to the dragon when hit, and the dragon may sometimes retaliate against other mobs if it takes damage to a projectile.\n\nAny entities hit by her wings are dealt 5 damage (or 10 damage if hit by her head), and in Java Edition, are thrown into the air, sometimes to fatal heights or even off the island.\n\nNeither of these effects is applied for 1 \u2044 2 second after the dragon takes damage.\n\nThe ender dragon has four main states of behavior: Guarding The dragon begins in this state, circling the ring of obsidian pillars on either the outside if there are still end crystals or the inside if the crystals are destroyed.\n\nWith each crystal's destruction, she takes damage and there is an increased chance of the dragon switching states.\n\nTargeting Whenever the dragon finds herself less than 10 blocks or more than 150 blocks from her current target, she attempts to choose a new target.\n\nWhen damaged she targets a point just behind herself, causing her to turn away and choose a new target.\n\nStrafing Upon the destruction of an end crystal, the dragon switches to strafing.\n\nAs soon as it is within 64 blocks, she shoots a fireball at the player.\n\nThe dragon resumes circling after this state.\n\nDiving The dragon dives onto the target player's position, taken at the start of the dive.\n\nThe dragon resumes circling after this state, whether or not she actually hit the player.\n\nPerching While Guarding and the dragon has reached the end of the path, she has 1 in (3 + crystals alive) chance (~7.7% up to 33%) to go to the exit portal structure (approaching from the side opposite the player if possible) and lands on the highest block of the coordinates (x=0, z=0), up to (y=101). [Bedrock Edition only ] If there is no block in (x=0, z=0) the dragon freezes right when she switches to perching. [Bedrock Edition only ] The dragon is immune to arrows in this state; they all catch fire and bounce off.\n\nIn Java Edition she is also immune to thrown tridents in this state.\n\nDragon's Breath Unless the player is in Peaceful difficulty, after 1.25 seconds, if a player is within 20 blocks of the exit portal structure, the dragon roars and use its 3-second breath attack, damaging players similarly to a lingering potion of Harming.\n\nAn area of visible particles in the shape of a horizontal disc one block tall and 5 to 6 blocks in diameter appears where the breath attack strikes, either on the ground or floating in the air, at whatever point the breath attack struck a block.\n\nThe harming effect zone where the player takes damage is confined to a smaller area in the center this visible cloud, covering about 3 to 4 blocks.\n\nThe harming effect portion of the purple clouds emitted from the dragon's breath attack can be collected in a glass bottle to obtain dragon's breath.\n\nEach bottle of dragon's breath collected removes one block from the lingering damage zone of the breath attack.\n\nThe visible clouds remain for 3 seconds whether the dragons breath is bottled or not.\n\nBy rapidly collecting all of the harmful blocks, usually around three, even a direct hit from the breath attack can be mostly and even entirely negated before the player suffers any damage.\n\nCharge If the player is not near the portal within 5 seconds of the dragon's landing, it charges at players within 150 blocks.\n\nTake-off After four consecutive breath attacks, or if the dragon fails to locate a player within 150 blocks, she takes off from her perch.\n\nShe always takes off in Peaceful difficulty, making it difficult to land melee hits.\n\nThe dragon resumes circling after this state.\n\nEscape If cumulative damage taken while perched exceeds 50 \u00d7 25, the dragon takes off and resets the damage accumulator.\n\nThe accumulator is not reset if she does not take enough damage.\n\nThe dragon resumes circling after this state.\n\nIn Java Edition, when the dragon finally takes a fatal blow, she flies toward the exit portal structure before dying, unless she cannot find it within 150 blocks, or it is inside blocks.\n\nDragon Fireball Dragon Fireball (JE) Dragon Fireball (BE) Behavior Does not exist Details Size Height: 1 Block Width: 1 Block Dragon fireballs are special fireballs that the ender dragon fires while strafing.\n\nThey cannot be deflected unlike ghast fireballs, and they do no impact damage.\n\nInstead, they deposit purple effect clouds across the ground that damages players the same way a lingering potion of Harming does.\n\nThis means that the ender dragon's fireballs deal magic damage, which ignores any damage reduction that comes from the player's armor.\n\nHowever its damage does get reduced by armor enchanted with the Protection enchantment.\n\nThe purple effect cloud's hitbox slowly grows larger in diameter until it disappears.\n\nAs with her close-ranged breath attack, the purple clouds can be bottled to obtain the dragon's breath.\n\nUnlike lingering potions of Harming, the effect cloud does not shrink when affecting mobs.\n\nJava Edition: Ender dragons use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nDragon fireballs use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 While the pillars are preparing to be resummoned, it occurs at 0 seconds, 2.5\u20132.6 seconds, and 4.75\u20135 seconds.\n\nWhen the ender dragon is about to be summoned, it occurs 5\u20134.75 seconds before and 2\u20130 seconds before.\n\n\u2191 Does not trigger at all if the gamerule globalSoundEvents is false Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Ender dragons have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity

landed state), 5=landed, performing breath attack, 6=landed, looking for a player for breath attack, 7=landed, roar before beginning breath attack, 8=charging player, 9=flying to portal to die, 10=hovering with no AI (default when using the / summon command).\n\nDragon fireballs have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nEntity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all fireballs Tags common to all projectiles A dragon fireball spawned by a command (left) and the damage and the explosion it caused (right).\n\nThe / summon ender_dragon command, by default, summons a harmless ender dragon that hovers in place  [JE only ].\n\nSetting the DragonPhase tag (by issuing either the / summon ender_dragon ~ ~ ~ {DragonPhase:0} or the / data merge entity <selector> {DragonPhase:0} commands) starts the ender dragon's ordinary behavior, although the health bar does not appear because it is managed by the ender dragon fight status rather than by the dragon entity itself  [JE only ].\n\nIf spawned away from the center of the map (x=0, z=0), it flies to the center then resumes normal behavior (see #Behavior).\n\nTarget selectors for the ender dragon target a total of 9 entities per dragon, as the ender dragon actually consists of 9 entities internally [Java Edition only ].\n\nSo executing at a dragon to summon an arrow summons 9 arrows.\n\nThis section would benefit from the addition of more images.\n\nPlease remove this notice once you've added suitable images to the article.\n\nThe specific instructions are: Ender dragon

The Void does not affect ender dragons.\n\nIf low enough on health, the ender dragon emits beams of light without dying, as if cracked.\n\nName tags cannot be used on an ender dragon.\n\nThe ender dragon's hitbox, especially her wings, is unexpected larger than the ender dragon itself, causing players to be pushed away from her from farther away than usual.\n\nIf the player kills a summoned dragon in the Overworld or Nether, it does not create a portal or an egg.\n\nIn Spectator mode, the player cannot view the perspective of the ender dragon, unlike any other mob.\n\nHowever, it is possible through the use of commands (like / spectate).\n\nWhen this happens, the player's camera appears about 1 block over the dragon's body.\n\nUsing F3 + B  [JE only ] to show hitboxes reveals that the ender dragon's head rotation faces in the opposite direction to where its real head faces.\n\nThis is also why the ender dragon faces the wrong way when set in a monster spawner.\n\nWhen an ender dragon is spawned in the Overworld, it flies to coordinates X=0 and Z=0 and dives at the ground or does the same behavior as if in the End.\n\nIf end crystals are placed in the Overworld, they heal the dragon as normal, but it does not perch anywhere, and continues to fly around forever.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, there is an unused texture file for a dragon fireball item.\n\nIn Super Smash Bros.\n\nUltimate, one of the spirits that comes with the Steve/Alex DLC is the ender dragon.\n\nIt appears as a Legend-class \"spirit\" that makes the user breathe fire for a long time at the start of each battle.\n\nA wither that is summoned to battle the ender dragon cannot deal damage because the ender dragon flies too fast, and she is immune to projectiles when perching.\n\nIf commands or Creative mode are used to get end portal frames and eyes of ender, a player can basically skip to the end poem.\n\nIf a player destroys ender crystals or even hurts the dragon and then uses a player-made portal, upon returning, the player retains their progress. [BE only ] The end dragon has the longest death sound She is clearly biologically female because she can lay eggs.\n\n(It\u2019s best not to think about this too much with chickens and cows) On Reddit, Notch suggested the ender dragon's name to be \"Jean?\" in the same manner he called the player \"Steve?\".\n\n[6] Dinnerbone later stated that he thinks the name is officially \"Jean?\".\n\n[7] Despite this, an article on Minecraft.net states that \"uttering its true name would unleash a destructive force that would obliterate not only the End, but the Nether and the Overworld at the same time.\" [8] Notch referred to the ender dragon as a she on Reddit [citation needed ], the Xbox avatar item Ender Dragon Pet has the description \"A cuter, friendlier version of his bigger, less playful Minecraft sister,\" and the encyclopedia in Bedrock Edition refers to the dragon with feminine pronouns.\n\nhowever, it has been later confirmed by Notch, [9] Brandon Pearce [10] and Jeb [11] that all mobs in Minecraft have no gender, which would include ender dragon unless they don\u2019t count bosses.\n\nBefore she was textured, Notch reported that he was afraid to texture the ender dragon as she was a complicated model.\n\n[12] In the end, the dragon model was so complex Notch stated that he gave up making the texture manually and wrote a texture packer tool to aid him in adding the texture to the model.\n\nNotch also uploaded the code for the tool so others could use the pack.\n\n(Link to the texture packer) [13] Notch joked about how Minecraft was \"going next-gen\" when deadmau5 mentioned this.\n\n[14] Notch has uploaded a video showing why ender dragons do not spawn in the main world, as they would destroy any block they touch.\n\n[15] On Reddit, Notch explained that ender dragons destroy Overworld matter because \"trying to make an AI to properly navigate arbitrary terrain before the code freeze next tuesday [sic ] isn't feasible\".\n\n[16]

[JE only ]) In Bedrock Edition, evokers can spawn in peaceful difficulty, and will not attack the player.\n\nEvokers can spawn during raids by themselves or riding ravagers.\n\nEvokers cannot spawn in raids in easy difficulty, because such raids have only three waves, while evokers appear in the fifth wave and above.\n\nEvokers spawn during raids starting at wave 5.\n\nUp to 5 evokers spawn on hard difficulty.\n\nDuring these events, they can be a raid captain.\n\nOn hard difficulty, evokers can also spawn riding a ravager at wave 7.\n\nThey may also rarely spawn as a raid captain.\n\nUp to 5

player or tamed wolf.\n\nAn evoker moves at the player's sprinting speed, crosses its arms and does not show its hands.\n\nAn evoker visually does not sit down when sitting in a boat or minecart.\n\nIf an evoker is riding a ravager, its legs appear to sink in the ravager's body.\n\nThis only happens in Bedrock Edition, as evokers put their legs in front of them while sitting on any entity in Java Edition.\n\nAn evoker attacking with its fangs.\n\nEvokers attack players, adult villagers, iron golems, snow golems  [BE only ] and wandering traders within 12 blocks by rising and waving both of their arms while looking at their target and summoning magical fangs or vexes, creating different colored particles for the different attacks.\n\nIf the player is within a 10 block radius and the evoker is not in the middle of summoning an attack, the evoker flees from the player to avoid being attacked.\n\nAn evoker summoning fangs in two circles around it.\n\nEvokers are passive in Peaceful difficulty  [BE only ].\n\nThey will still attack any adult villagers, iron golems, wandering traders, or snow golems in the Peaceful difficulty.\n\nIf an evoker is attacked, all nearby [needs testing ] evokers become alerted and start attacking the player, even if they are behind walls.\n\nIn Java Edition, the alerted evokers can attack the player from an infinite distance away, even if the player switches to Creative or Spectator mode [1]; this can be fixed by relogging the world, or by setting the game rule universalAnger to True [needs testing ].\n\nIn Java Edition, an evoker is passive to other illagers even if it is harmed.\n\nAny evoker can search for and join a patrol if sufficiently near a patrol captain.\n\nIn Java Edition, evokers and illusioners are faster without any effects during raids.\n\nIn Java Edition, evokers are given 3 seconds of the Glowing effect if a bell is rung within 32 blocks of them.\n\nThis applies to both evokers spawned in raids and evokers spawned in woodland mansions.\n\nEvokers flee from creakings when within 8 blocks of them.\n\nThe evoker signals this attack by producing purple particles () and a low-pitched sound.\n\nA number of fangs rise out of the ground around the player, then snap shut and vanish.\n\nPlayers or mobs caught in the attack are dealt 6 damage, regardless of difficulty.\n\nThis harm is not mitigated by armor but is mitigated by enchantments such as Protection.\n\nAny evoker-summoned fangs do not deal damage to any illagers (witches are not illagers, so can be damaged and will retaliate [other than in a raid, in which case the witch will drink a beneficial potion and ignore [needs testing ] ]), although fangs summoned or spawned by the player do.\n\nFangs appear no lower than the feet of the lowest combatant and no higher than one block above the feet of the highest combatant.\n\nFangs attempt to appear on the highest opaque block between those two extremes, but fail to spawn if they are obstructed by a solid block.\n\nIn practice, this means that fangs cannot spawn inside deep pits or on top of high walls, but may, for example, go up a staircase if the target is at the top and the evoker at the bottom, or vice versa.\n\nLikewise, an evoker floating in a boat on water cannot summon fangs against a player swimming or floating in a boat because there are no opaque blocks from which the fangs can appear.\n\nThe evoker typically summons 16 fangs in a straight line toward the target.\n\nHowever, if the target is within 3 blocks of the evoker, the evoker summons the fangs in two circles around itself: the smaller circle has 5 fangs and the larger has 8.\n\nThe fangs do not seek the player, thus the player is able to dodge them.\n\nSummoning fangs

gamerule mobGriefing is set to false.\n\nThis section of the article is empty.\n\nYou can help by adding to it.\n\nThis article is about the evoker fangs in Minecraft.\n\nFor evoker fangs in Minecraft Dungeons, see MCD:Evoker \u00a7 Evoker fang.\n\nEvoker Fangs Behavior Does not exist Details Size Height: 0.8 Blocks Width: 0.5 Blocks Evoker fangs are the entities that evokers use to attack the player with their fang attack.\n\nEvoker fangs are not affected by the peaceful difficulty.\n\nThe individual fangs in an evoker's fang attacks each have a delay.\n\nBefore the delay is over, the fangs cannot be seen, although unlike truly invisible entities, fangs in warmup still have a visible debug hitbox.\n\nAfter the delay, the fangs expand into existence, snap shut, make critical hit particles and shrink out of sight again, dealing 6 magic damage to all mobs standing on the spot.\n\nKilling an evoker fang does not contribute to the Monster Hunter advancement or

\"Evoker\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe sheep color conversion spell is a reference to the priest units from Age of Empires, where they can turn enemy units into friendly units (changing the unit's color in the process) after making a \"wololo\" sound.\n\nBecause Microsoft controls the copyrights for both Age of Empires and Minecraft, Mojang was able to get the actual \"wololo\" sound effect to use in the conversion sound effect.\n\nEvokers are referred to as 'evocation illagers' in the code for pre-1.13 and Bedrock Edition code.\n\nHitting an evoker in

[JE only ] See also: Tutorials/Combat \u00a7 Guardians Guardians have two methods of attack: a laser and a defensive attack analogous to the Thorns enchantment.\n\nUnlike most other hostile mobs, a guardian does not follow a player who moves out of sight.\n\nInstead, it simply continues swimming until the player becomes visible again to start charging its laser.\n\nGuardians attack players, axolotls, and squid.\n\nOtherwise, a guardian does not retaliate against mobs (such as iron golems) that attack it, other than damaging the attacking mob with its natural thorns defense.\n\nLaser The laser takes 2 seconds to charge, doing no damage in the meantime.\n\nIt starts out purple and fades to yellow.\n\nOnce charged, the laser flashes green and deals 6 regular damage and additional 1 magical damage on normal difficulty.\n\nThe latter bypasses armor.\n\nGuardians swim around for 3 seconds before firing again.\n\nIf the target approaches while the guardian is loading its laser, it stops firing and swims away until it is at a comfortable range, at which point it continues attacking.\n\nThe laser cannot be dodged or blocked by a shield and has a maximum range of 15 blocks.\n\nOnce the target is out of range, or if the laser is obstructed by solid blocks (including transparent blocks like glass), the guardian's laser disengages.\n\nSpikes defense Guardians deal damage each time it is hit with a melee attack while its spikes are extended, similar to the Thorns armor enchantment.\n\nIf cornered, the guardian usually extends its spikes and fires at the player, even at point-blank range.\n\nJava Edition: Guardians use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 Increases quadratically from minimum to maximum as the attack goes on \u2191 Increases linearly from minimum to maximum as the attack goes on Bedrock Edition: \u2191 MCPE-26929 Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Guardians have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nNote: This video is outdated in Java Edition, as raw fish, cooked fish and clownfish are now called raw cod, cooked cod, and tropical fish as of 1.13.\n\nIssues relating to \"Guardian\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nA guardian's eye is actually the \"head\" part of the mob 's model.\n\nThis gives the illusion of a dynamic eye.\n\nGuardians' laser-beam attacks are affected by the potion of strength, which normally affects only melee attacks.\n\nWhen placed or spawned on a slime block, guardians start bouncing and continue and each bounce higher than the last, until each bounce brings the guardian to 17 blocks height.\n\nIn the texture file for the guardian, \"jeb\" is written in the bottom right corner.\n\n[verify ] If summoned with {NoAI:1}, the guardian's eye still follows the player.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, guardians do not make the flopping sounds while on land.\n\nJeb 's Instagram mob reveal.\n\nThe inside of a guardian (with their spikes extended).\n\nA guardian's \"eye\" follows players at any position.\n\nA guardian attacking a squid.\n\nA group of guardians defending their monument.\n\nSize comparison between a guardian and its elder variant.\n\nA guardian in a boat.\n\nThe guardian texture, with \"jeb\" written in the corner.\n\nThe guardian face texture as revealed by Jeb on reddit.\n\nGuardians in promotional artwork for the Boss Update.\n\nLego Minecraft Guardian.\n\n\u2191 MC-57057 \u2014 Guardian laser attack sound ignores distance Meet the Guardian \u2013 Minecraft.net on September 25, 2017 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

players.\n\nAdult hoglins drop when killed: 2\u20134 raw porkchop (cooked porkchop while on fire).\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 7 with Looting III.\n\n0\u20131 leather.\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 4 with Looting III.\n\n5 [JE only ] or 1\u20133 [BE only ] if killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nBaby hoglins drop only experience when killed, at the same rate as adult hoglins.\n\nThey are also the only mobs that both grow up and also drop experience.\n\nHoglins avoid warped fungi (including in a flower pot), nether portals and respawn anchors, and will run away from them when within 7 blocks of them.\n\nThey naturally sink in water and eventually drown.\n\n[1] They also sink in lava and are vulnerable to fire damage.\n\n[2] Hoglins can be led with a lead despite the fact they are hostile.\n\nHoglins attack any player within 16 blocks with a reach of 1.9 blocks.\n\nAn adult knocks its target upward.\n\nPlayers can still be flung even if they block with a shield.\n\nHoglins do not attack a player standing near a block that repels them, but run away from the block unless they have already chosen to attack.\n\nHoglins are 60% resistant to knockback.\n\nUnlike other hostile mobs, they do not prevent a player from sleeping.\n\nSimilarly to piglins and zombified piglins, a player or mob attacking a hoglin provokes all nearby hoglins.\n\nAttacking a baby hoglin does not trigger this behavior.\n\nIf a piglin attacks a hoglin, all the hoglins in the area retaliate.\n\nHoglins also flee if outnumbered and make retreating sounds.\n\nIf the piglins are outnumbered by hoglins, they flee and make retreating sounds.\n\nHoglins that spawn upon generation of bastion remnants are not hunted by piglins.\n\nBaby hoglins also attack the player, dealing much less damage and normal knockback.\n\nIf the player attacks a baby hoglin, it temporarily flees.\n\nBaby piglins run near and ride baby hoglins.\n\nIf there are more baby piglins than baby hoglins, the baby piglins occasionally jump on other baby piglins already riding a baby hoglin, with a maximum of 3 stacked on a single baby hoglin.\n\nA hoglin turning into a zoglin.\n\nNotice the hair is flattened down.\n\nIf a hoglin spawns in or moves to the Overworld or the End, it shakes and then transforms into a zoglin after 15 seconds.\n\nThe newly-created zoglin gets Nausea I for 10 seconds.\n\nThis Nausea effect is only decorative and has no effect on the zoglin's behavior.\n\nIn Java Edition, any lead attached to the hoglin breaks when it converts, even though zoglins can have leads attached to them.\n\n[3] Main article: Breeding Other than the killer bunny  [Java Edition only ], the hoglin is the only hostile mob that can be bred.\n\nHoglins can be bred using crimson fungi.\n\nIt takes 5 minutes before the parents can be bred again, and it takes 20 minutes for baby hoglins to mature.\n\nBaby hoglins stay near their parents unless they see a player or get attacked, in which case they attack or run away.\n\nFeeding a crimson fungus to a baby hoglin reduces the remaining time for it to mature by 10%.\n\nHoglins cannot be bred when they are running away from warped fungi, respawn anchors or nether portals.\n\nFeeding crimson fungi to a hoglin prevents it from despawning, regardless of whether the breeding is successful or not.\n\nThe baby hoglin produced by breeding does not despawn either.\n\nJava Edition: Hoglins use the Hostile Creatures sound category for

warped fungi is because they dislike their smell.\n\n[7] Similarly, when asked if nether portals smell bad to Hoglins, Henrik responded saying that the reason Hoglins run away from Nether Portals is because they find the sound annoying.\n\n[8] Similar to the ravager originally being called \" illager beast\" before its official name was chosen by the community, the Hoglin's name was also chosen by the community.\n\nIts initial placeholder name was \"piglin beast\".\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, there are unused texture files named hoglin_meat_raw and hoglin_meat_cooked that are textured identically to raw and cooked beef, respectively.\n\nHenrik Kniberg released a video [9] of a group of hoglins killing a piglin, then \"celebrating\" by bobbing their heads, then getting on their hind legs and

Illager hostile mob Behavior Hostile Damage Easy and normal: 2 \u2013 5 Hard: 3 \u2013 5 The illusioner is an unused illager armed with a bow.\n\nIt attacks using illusions and can also fire arrows.\n\nAn illusioner has no spawn egg in the Creative mode inventory.\n\nAn illusioner can be spawned only using data packs or the / summon illusioner in-game command.\n\nIllusioners do not spawn in woodland mansions or pillager outposts, nor at raids or patrols.\n\nSimilarly to the other unused giant and zombie horse mobs, illusioners do not spawn in any biome, monster spawner or world -generated structure.\n\nWhen an illusioner is killed by a player or a tamed wolf, any naturally spawned equipment, including its unenchanted bow, has an 8.5% chance of dropping (or 9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) and drops with a random item durability.\n\nIn addition, 5 experience orbs are dropped on player or tamed wolf kills.\n\nAn invisible illusioner captain and its four copies strafing.\n\nThe real banner is invisible.\n\nThe illusioner also drops one illager ominous banner if it is a raid captain.\n\nAlthough they do not naturally spawn in raids, illusioners spawned by the player attack players, adult villagers, iron golems and wandering traders within a 16*4*16 cubic area.\n\nAn illusioner joins a nearby raid if it occurs or joins a patrol if sufficiently near a patrol captain.\n\nThe illusioner attacks with its spells and its bow, firing an arrow every second.\n\nUnless the illusioner is summoned using commands, it cannot attack with a non-bow item in its hand, cannot use tipped arrows in its offhand slot (but can use spectral arrows) and cannot use enchanted bows.\n\nAlso, it is the only illager that can see its target through walls.\n\nThe Illusioner moves quickly on a semi-circular fashion and always tries to maintain a consistent distance between itself and the player, strafing from left to right and vice-versa, retreating if the player gets too close or advancing if the player retreats.\n\nFinally, the illusioner has two spells: a spell that blinds its opponent and a spell that summons visual pseudo-duplicates and makes the illusioner invisible.\n\nThe illusioner casts its blindness spell only if the regional difficulty is greater than 2.\n\nAs result, the world difficulty setting, the inhabited time of a chunk, the total daytime in the world and the phase of the moon from the day-night cycle affects its ability.\n\nAn illusioner's four false duplicates.\n\nThe real illusioner is invisible.\n\nAn illusioner casts a Blindness effect that lasts for 20 seconds upon first engaging a new player opponent.\n\nIt signals this attack by raising its arms during a short-timed animation, making a low pitched sound and producing a black mist of particles ().\n\nOther entities (typically a wolf, a snow golem or an iron golem) do not trigger this magic.\n\nThe illusioner does not cast this spell more than once on the same player opponent, unless it has first shifted its attention to another opponent and then back to that original opponent.\n\nThis spell resets the illusioner's spell cooldown to 1 second and resets the cooldown for the blinding spell to 9 seconds.\n\nAs long as an illusioner is engaged in combat, it casts an Invisibility status effect on itself that lasts 60 seconds and refreshes the effect whenever the Invisibility's time runs out.\n\nThe illusioner signals this spell by raising its arms, making a strange high pitched sound and producing a blue mist of particles called \"mirror\" ().\n\nWhen an illusioner becomes invisible through this or another method, it creates four false duplicates of itself.\n\nThese hover and waver at short distances from the actually invisible illusioner, though they do not space themselves out until the first time the illusioner is attacked.\n\nThey face in exactly the same direction as the illusioner and move somewhat in step with the original, appearing to no-clip through blocks like a vex does.\n\nDespite using the shooting animation whenever the original uses its bow, only the real illusioner can shoot and be damaged.\n\nThe clones move to new positions if they were not triggered and are still bunched together.\n\nThe Illusioner can also do this once in a while to \"refresh\" the clones' positions.\n\nWhen the real illusioner is damaged, its duplicates all snap back to where the real illusioner is, then quickly snap back out to new positions, making a teleporting sound, signaling the hit.\n\nIf an invisible illusioner receives the Glowing effect, all of the duplicates glow, while the true illusioner remains invisible.\n\nMoreover, only the invisible illusioner burns when catching fire.\n\nThe duplicates dissipate once the illusioner's Invisibility effect ends.\n\nThis spell resets the illusioner's spell cooldown to 1 second and resets the cooldown for the invisibility spell to 17 seconds.\n\nIllusioners use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b c MC-98316 See also: Entity format Illusioners have entity data associated with them

by teleportation via an ender pearl or chorus fruit, endermen or shulkers, albeit with a slight distortion at the end.\n\nIllusioners shoot backward when they are in a boat.\n\n[2] Illusioners hold bows in a different direction compared to skeletons or players, a little more diagonally.\n\nThe illusioner's second death sound is the same as the evoker's second death sound.\n\nIn a video titled ' Easter Eggs behind the...\n\nSick villagers???\n\n' that was recently posted on the official Minecraft YouTube channel, not only do they mention the Illusioner, but Jens also says 'You will definitely

magma cube is a hostile mob found in the Nether.\n\nA magma cube behaves similarly to a slime, but is fireproof, jumps higher and less often, and deals more damage.\n\nSee also: Spawn \u00a7 Spawn cycle Magma cubes spawn in areas of the Nether at all light levels.\n\nThe space they spawn in must be clear of solid obstructions and liquids.\n\nDue to being inherently fireproof, magma cubes can spawn on magma blocks.\n\nOnly sizes 1, 2 and 4 (NBT Size tag values 0, 1 and 3 respectively) spawn naturally.\n\nWith use of / summon, magma cubes can potentially range from size 1 to 127 (NBT Size tag 0\u2013126).\n\n[verify ] This large magma cube attempts to spawn on the basalt, but because there is a piece of iron bar intersecting its hitbox, it is unable to spawn.\n\nThis check is performed before the size of the magma cube is determined, meaning no magma cubes can spawn at that location.\n\nA magma cube needs roughly a 3\u00d72.1x3 free space to spawn.\n\nThe area in which they spawn must be clear of solid or liquid obstructions.\n\nWhen a magma cube attempts to spawn, the game checks for the space requirement of a large magma cube, and the size is determined later.\n\nTherefore, since large magma cubes are slightly taller than 2 blocks, no magma cubes, regardless of size, are able to spawn at all in 2-block-high areas.\n\nAlso, since large magma cubes are slightly wider than 2 blocks, and mobs spawn at the center of a block, having any block within the 3\u00d72.1x3 area, even as thin as a glass pane, can prevent a magma cube of any size from spawning.\n\nMagma cubes' size is affected by regional difficulty: chances range from 33% for each size at the low difficulty to 16% small, 33% medium, and 50% big with higher difficulty.\n\nMagma cubes spawn uncommonly in nether wastes in groups of 1 to 4.\n\nMagma cubes spawn commonly in nether fortresses in groups of 4.\n\nMagma cubes spawn commonly in basalt deltas, in groups of 2 to 5.\n\nMagma cube monster spawners generate in the treasure room of bastions.\n\nLarge magma cube: 0\u20131 magma cream (0.25 average) and 4 experience Medium magma cube: 0\u20131 magma cream (0.25 average) and 2 experience Small magma cube: 1 experience (or 1 froglight if killed by a frog).\n\nThe maximum of magma cream can be increased by 1 per level of Looting.\n\nLooting 1 averages 0.5 per kill, Looting 2 averages ~0.81 per kill, and Looting 3 averages ~1.21 per kill.\n\nUnlike a lot of common loot which picks a random number between 0 and 1 for its drop, the magma cube's drop ranges between -2 and 1 instead.\n\nThis leads to the 25% drop chance from an unenchanted kill, as well as the relatively low averages with the Looting enchantment since a negative base roll can cancel out the bonus roll made by Looting.\n\nMagma cube jumping.\n\nA magma cube seeks out any player or an iron golem within a spherical distance of 16 blocks.\n\nIf it finds no enemy, it changes direction every 40 to 100 ticks (2 to 5 seconds) and jumps forward every 40 to 120 ticks (2 to 6 seconds).\n\nIf it finds a target, the delay before jumping is 1 \u2044 3 as long (13 to 40 ticks), and the magma cube changes direction directly toward the target before jumping.\n\nMagma cubes cannot be hurt by fall damage or burning, and are not slowed down by lava.\n\nThey can swim upward in lava and leap above its surface.\n\nTheir jump height depends on their size.\n\nTheir forward speed is twice that of most other mobs.\n\nThey always make a distinct sound upon jumping up and landing, but no idle sounds.\n\nWhen a magma cube is killed, it splits into 2-4 smaller magma cubes.\n\nTiny magma cubes disappear when killed, like other mobs.\n\nThey can swim in water and attempt to stay on the surface.\n\nLike slimes, magma cubes starts taking drowning damage if submerged in water for 15 seconds, splitting into smaller cubes if possible.\n\nMagma cubes take extra damage from powder snow, taking 5 every two seconds, unlike 1 for other mobs.\n\nUnlike most mobs, magma cubes have no pathfinding ability, meaning that they do not avoid falling off cliffs and cannot go around walls, even when chasing a player.\n\nThis behavior is shared by slimes.\n\nWhen they are in lava, they hover and try to move to nearby land.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Combat \u00a7 Magma Cubes Magma cubes attack by jumping and attempting to land on the player, and cause damage when touched anywhere.\n\nAs their jump rate is random, magma cubes can be hard to fight.\n\nThe health of a magma cube is its size squared; the attack strength is its size + 2, and the armor points are its size tripled.\n\nA magma cube jumps a distance of approximately its length times 1.5 and a height equivalent to its size in blocks.\n\nThis means that a large magma cube jumps 4 blocks in height and moves significantly quicker than a small magma cube, which jumps 2 blocks in height; while a tiny magma cube moves slowly and jumps 1 block in height.\n\nMagma cubes continuously damage all players and iron golems [JE only ] they collide with (although damage immunity reduces the actual damage to 2 attacks per second), unlike other mobs that damage only those targets they specifically attack.\n\n[1] This means that a large magma cube deals 12 \u00d7 6 of damage per second on normal difficulty.\n\nUnlike slimes, tiny magma cubes can deal damage to the player.\n\nJava Edition: Magma cubes use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b c MC-98316 \u2014 Wrong subtitles

    "content": "For the mob in Minecraft Dungeons, see MCD:Phantom.\n\nPhantom Phantom Phantom (BE) Health 20 \u00d7 10 Classification Undead Behavior Hostile Spawn In the Overworld at nighttime or during thunderstorms, when player has not entered a bed for at least 3 ingame days.\n\nDamage Java Edition: Easy & Normal: 2 Hard: 3 Bedrock Edition: Easy: 4 Normal: 6 Hard: 9 Details Size Height: 0.5 Blocks Width: 0.9 Blocks Phantoms are flying undead hostile mobs that spawn in the night sky when the player has not laid in a bed or died for three or more in-game days.\n\nThey attack by diving at the player from the sky to bite them.\n\nUsually, they appear in trios.\n\nTwo phantoms at night.\n\nPhantoms spawn unless the game rule doInsomnia is set to false.\n\nThe spawning mechanics differ between Java and Bedrock editions.\n\nIn both editions, they spawn in the Overworld above the player if the \"Time Since Last Rest\" statistic is at least 1 hour (72000 ticks or 3 in-game days).\n\n[verify ] This statistic is reset when the player dies or enters a bed.\n\nFurthermore, the player must not have a block overhead that blocks light in any way; for example, leaves prevent phantoms from spawning as they have a light opacity of 2, but glass does not, as its light opacity is 0.\n\nPhantoms do not spawn in Spectator mode, [JE only ] but they do spawn in Creative mode.\n\n[1] Phantom spawning is similar to other monsters spawning: the spawn location must have a light level of 7 or less, and spawns are limited by the monster population cap.\n\nPhantoms are also subject to a density cap of 5.\n\nPhantom spawn attempts are made on surface blocks throughout the same spawn radius as other monsters.\n\nHowever, when a phantom spawn attempt succeeds the phantom appears somewhere in a 21\u00d715\u00d721 cube centered 28 blocks above the player instead of at the block where the spawn attempt occurred.\n\nPhantoms attempt to spawn every 1\u20132 minutes.\n\nThey spawn only if it is night or a thunderstorm is happening, the player is above sea level (y=64) with sky access, and the local difficulty is greater than a randomly chosen value between 0.0 and 3.0.\n\nThe chance of a successful spawn is x \u221272000 \u2044 x, where x is the number of ticks since the player last entered a bed or died.\n\nThis roughly comes to a 1 \u2044 4 (25.0%) chance on day 4, a 2 \u2044 5 (40.0%) chance on day 5, a 3 \u2044 6 (1 \u2044 2) (50.0%) chance on day 6, 4 \u2044 7 (about 57.1%) chance on day 7, and so on.\n\nIf all conditions are met, a group of phantoms attempt to spawn 20\u201334 blocks above the player, and off to the side by a taxicab distance of up to 10 blocks.\n\nThe number of phantoms spawned is 1-2 in Easy difficulty, 1-3 in Normal, and 1-4 in Hard.\n\nPhantoms can spawn inside buildings, if the player is outside and the building is both near enough and the building has a large enough cavity for them to spawn inside.\n\nPhantoms are counted toward the hostile mob cap, but they don't adhere to it when spawning.\n\n[2] Their spawning mechanic is based on the location of players in the world rather than by chance, unlike regular mob spawning.\n\nPhantom spawning is completely independent of the biome, meaning they can spawn in biomes that normally prevent hostile mob spawning such as mushroom fields [3] and the void [4].\n\nPhantoms increase in number every consecutive night a player hasn't entered a bed and stop spawning when the player lies down in bed.\n\nPhantoms drop when killed: 0\u20131 phantom membrane s when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nLooting increases the maximum drops by 1 per level, for a maximum of 4 with Looting III.\n\n5 when killed by the player or a tamed wolf.\n\nA phantom swooping at the player.\n\nWhen idle, phantoms fly around in a roughly circular pattern within 15 to 25 blocks of a player horizontally and within 24 to 35 blocks of a player vertically, leaving a trail of gray smoke while doing so.\n\nTheir movement speed is one of the fastest of any mob, up to 20 blocks per second.\n\nThey have a large search radius, targeting and following players from 64 blocks away [BE only ] [more information needed ].\n\nOnce every 10-20 seconds [BE only ] [more information needed ] they swoop down or up quickly to attack.\n\nIf stopped or hurt during this action, the phantom retreats back to its original elevation.\n\nWhen a path to its original elevation is obstructed by a block, the phantom continues attempting to return to its original elevation until it either attacks or moves out from under the block.\n\nPhantoms do not attack an exposed player sleeping in a bed.\n\nPhantoms can move through water at their normal speed.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a phantom underwater attempts to fly to the surface, and dies from drowning after 20 seconds if trapped underwater.\n\nPhantoms do not drown in Java Edition.\n\nA phantom's body disappears when under the Invisibility effect, but its eyes and smoke particles are still visible.\n\nCats hiss at phantoms that are currently attacking players, and phantoms try to stay at least 64 blocks away from them.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, phantoms also avoid ocelots in the same manner.\n\nLike other undead mobs, phantoms are harmed by the Instant Health effect, healed by the Instant Damage effect, immune to the Poison and Regeneration effects, ignored by the wither, and affected by the Smite enchantment.\n\nLike zombies and skeletons, phantoms burn in sunlight.\n\nThey burn even when equipped with helmets through commands.\n\n[5] Java Edition: Phantoms use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Phantoms have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs AX: The phantom, when not actively attacking, attempts to circle around X,Y,Z = AX, AY, AZ.\n\nAppears to reset to a point above the target player every time the phantom flies up after a swoop.\n\nSet to spawn location if not specified.\n\nAY: See AX.\n\nAZ: See AX.\n\nSize: The size of the phantom.\n\nRanges from 0 to 64, similar to slimes.\n\nUnlike slimes, phantoms always have a constant 20 \u00d7 10 HP, and deal 6 + Size damage.\n\nNaturally spawned phantoms are always size 0.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Phantom\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe red phantom design was scrapped because it looked like a Nether mob.\n\nAt one point before the release of 18w10a, the phantom texture was made red, but it was decided that it appeared too much like a Nether mob.\n\n[8] The phantom was originally going to have a mouth, like the drawing shown during MINECON Earth, but it was eventually scrapped because \"it looked so much like a muppet\".\n\n[8] Earlier designs can be seen on Minecraft 's Instagram account.\n\n[9] The sounds of the phantom were taken from Samuel \u00c5berg 's baby son screaming.\n\n[10] Despite that they are flying mobs, phantoms can destroy turtle eggs when on top of them.\n\n[11] The game rule that modify Phantom spawning

    "content": "This article is about the hostile mob in Minecraft.\n\nFor the hostile mob in Minecraft Dungeons, see:MCD:Pillager.\n\nNot to be confused with Villager, Witch or Illager.\n\nSee also: Raid captain Pillager Pillager Aiming Pillager (BE) Aiming (BE) Health 24 \u00d7 12 Classification Illager Behavior Hostile Passive (only if its crossbow is broken) Spawn Patrols Pillager outposts Raids Damage Ranged Easy: 3.5 \u00d7 1.75 Normal: 4 Hard: 4.5 \u00d7 2.25 Melee  [BE only ] Easy: 2 Normal: 3 Hard: 5 Details Size In Java Edition: Height: 1.95 Blocks Width: 0.6 Blocks In Bedrock Edition: Height: 1.9 Blocks Width: 0.6 Blocks Pillagers are hostile mobs armed with crossbows found in wandering patrols, in pillager outposts, or as participants in raids.\n\nThey attack by firing arrows at the player.\n\nIn Java Edition, a pillager spawned by a player using a spawn egg or commands can be a captain which has an ominous banner sticking out of its head.\n\nIn Java Edition, the number of pillagers spawning in each patrol varies from one to five and depends on the regional difficulty, with one spawning as a patrol captain.\n\nPatrols occur after 5 1 \u2044 2 in-game days, any time and independently of structures, which means they still spawn in worlds without generated structures.\n\nA patrol spawns 24 to 48 blocks away from a random player, on the highest solid block.\n\nThe individual pillagers of a patrol can spawn only at block light level less than 9, regardless of sky light.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, each patrol spawns two to five pillagers.\n\nOne of these pillagers is a patrol captain.\n\nAfter 5 1 \u2044 2 in-game days, patrols appear 24 to 48 blocks away from the player, at a light level of 7 and below on Easy or any light level on Normal and Hard difficulty.\n\nPillagers continually spawn in a 72\u00d754\u00d772 block volume centered on the top floor in a pillager outpost.\n\nSome pillagers spawn as outpost captains.\n\nThey may spawn on any valid opaque block if the block light level is less than or equal to 8.\n\nIn Java Edition, there can be unlimited pillagers that spawn in outposts naturally, limited only by the natural spawning rules.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, pillagers continually spawn at or below a particular location in the outpost, choosing the highest opaque block with a non-solid block on top and spawning on the northwest corner.\n\nA maximum of eight pillagers spawn naturally in an outpost.\n\nIn a raid, pillagers are more common in the earlier waves and decrease in number as the waves progress.\n\nDespite this, they still constitute the majority of raiders in total.\n\nOne pillager spawns riding a ravager in the fifth wave.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, one of the ravagers is ridden by a pillager instead of a vindicator on the seventh wave.\n\nIn Java Edition, pillagers spawn during bonus waves and have the largest chance of being the raid captain in the first wave, but in the second wave and onwards, vindicators have a greater chance than pillagers of being the raid captain.\n\nA pillager drops upon death: In Bedrock Edition, pillagers drop 0 - 2 arrow s.\n\nEach level of the Looting enchantment increases the maximum number of arrows dropped for up to five.\n\nThere is a 8.5% chance to drop a crossbow when killed by the player or a tamed wolf.\n\nThe crossbow may be loaded or unloaded depending on the crossbow's state when the pillager dies.\n\nThe drop chance increases by 1% per level of Looting.\n\nThe crossbow is of a random durability and has a chance of being enchanted.\n\nThe chance ranges from 0% to 10% depending on the regional difficulty.\n\nThe enchantment level is from 5 to 19.\n\n5 experience points and an additional 1\u20133 points per naturally-spawned equipment when killed by the player or a tamed wolf.\n\nIts illager ominous banner if spawned as a captain.\n\n1 Ominous Bottle which gives Bad Omen I-V if spawned as a captain.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, pillagers that were spawned by raids have a 6% chance on easy and normal or 80% chance on hard difficulties to drop these: 0\u20131 Emerald (10 \u2044 39 or 25.6%) 2\u20133 Emerald (5 \u2044 39 or 12.8%) 4\u20135 Emerald (2 \u2044 39 or 5.1%) 1 Enchanted Book (2 \u2044 39 or 5.1%) 1 Iron Pickaxe (5 \u2044 78 or 6.4%) 1 Iron Axe (5 \u2044 78 or 6.4%) 1 Iron Shovel (5 \u2044 78 or 6.4%) 1 Iron Sword (5 \u2044 78 or 6.4%) 1 Iron Helmet (5 \u2044 78 or 6.4%) 1 Iron Chestplate (5 \u2044 78 or 6.4%) 1 Iron Leggings (5 \u2044 78 or 6.4%) 1 Iron Boots (5 \u2044 78 or 6.4%) The iron equipment drops have a 50% chance to be enchanted at level 5 to 19.\n\nSaid equipment may also have enchantment combinations that cannot be normally obtained, such as Blast Protection and Fire Protection on the same pair of boots.\n\nIron equipment drops are always of 30 to 90% item durability.\n\nThese drops are affected by the Looting enchantment.\n\nEnchanted books have level 30 enchantments, which can also be treasure enchantments.\n\nSpecial loot chances of dropping Easy and normal modes Hard mode An emerald: 8.32% 10.24% 2-3 emeralds: 8.32% 10.24% 4-5 emeralds: 3.33% 4.102% An enchanted book: 3.33% 4.102% An iron equipment: 4.16% 5.12% Pillagers are hostile toward players, iron golems, wandering traders and adult villagers.\n\nPillagers also aid other pillagers attacked by other mobs.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a pillager that accidentally harms a vindicator or evoker causes it to retaliate and attack the pillager.\n\nIn Java Edition, pillagers do not retaliate on vindicators or evokers that attack them.\n\nA passive pillager holding an ominous banner in the right hand.\n\nWhen a player is in Creative mode or applied with the Invisibility effect, getting near a pillager still causes it to take notice and stare at the player.\n\nIf a pillager notices an enemy while staring at the player, the pillager stops staring and attacks the enemy.\n\nIf a player with the invisibility effect attacks a pillager, the pillager still retaliates.\n\nA pillager attacks by shooting arrows from its crossbows every three seconds from up to eight blocks away and pursues enemies for up to 64 blocks in Java Edition or 16 blocks in Bedrock Edition.\n\nPillagers move slowly when wandering or loading crossbows in Java Edition.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, pillagers move from one place to another as fast as when they're provoked, although they stop and look around, pointing their crossbows along.\n\nPillagers point their crossbows at any player or mob they are looking at, whether their crossbows are loaded or unloaded.\n\nA pillager stares at the player and points its crossbow toward the player when the player is in creative mode or when the player has the invisibility status effect.\n\nThe patrol captain wears an ominous banner, known as the illager banner in Bedrock and Education Editions, on its head.\n\nThe other illagers follow the captain around.\n\nThe pillagers that are part of a patrol do not attack immediately.\n\nThe patrol members' heads turn to follow the player or mob who attracted their attention.\n\nIf the player or villager-like mob attacks or approaches within ten blocks of the patrol members, then this provokes them into loading their crossbows and attacking.\n\n[1] If raiding pillagers kill all the villagers in a village, they celebrate their victory by jumping and laughing.\n\nUnarmed pillagers also cheer.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, pillagers wave their arms while holding their crossbows in their main hand when cheering.\n\nPillagers can take and equip illager banners within 3 blocks, but non-raider pillagers do not search for ominous banners.\n\nIn Java Edition, if a pillager gets attacked by a mob (excluding illagers and goats) or player, it will alert other pillagers to target the attacker unless the pillager was killed in one hit.\n\nPillagers can also use crossbows in their off-hand.\n\nWhen a pillager finds a target, the pillager chases the target, then locks the target in its attack range and loads its crossbow.\n\nPillagers with their crossbows loaded can attack at any blocks away if the target is out of their attack range.\n\nPillagers, unlike evokers or vindicators, attack on sight, not regarding distance, although attacking a pillager, vindicator or evoker far away causes the attacked illager and the same type of illagers around the attacked illager to attack the player regardless of distance.\n\nThe command /summon pillager ~ ~ ~ {} summons a passive pillager that does not attack.\n\nA pillager's crossbow eventually breaks with repeated use, unlike weapons wielded by other mobs.\n\n[2] Unarmed pillagers are passive toward the player, iron golems and villagers, but they still frighten villagers and iron golems are still hostile toward them.\n\nThis also includes pillagers that don't have a crossbow, which means any pillagers with a sword or any weapon other than a crossbow are still passive.\n\nAn unarmed pillager always faces any player in its field of view or any mob that attacks it.\n\nA pillager spawned with arrows or firework rockets in its off-hand slot will use them, depleting the stack over time and switching to regular arrows once running out of ammo.\n\n[3] When firing firework rockets, pillagers will aim above the target as when using arrows, despite rockets being unaffected by gravity.\n\n[4] If a pillager's arrow hits a neutral or hostile mob by accident, the mob attacks the pillager.\n\nPillagers cannot use their crossbows in their off-hand, as mobs cannot use weapons in their off-hand, just like players.\n\nThe different of the pillagers texture in Java (left) and Bedrock (right) Edition.\n\nPillagers use an outdated behavior.\n\n[5] [6] They also have different arm textures.\n\n[7] Pillagers load their crossbows upon spawning or if their crossbows are unloaded.\n\nWhen a pillager finds a target, it loads its crossbow first, chases the target and attacks upon in range.\n\nPillagers are not hostile to players before their crossbows are loaded, so sometimes they don't look at players or run around while loading their crossbows.\n\nA dispenser can equip a pillager with armor.\n\nHowever, an armor item isn't rendered on pillagers.\n\nIf a player summons a pillager without a crossbow by spawn event command, it still shoots arrows to attack targets, like other arrow-shooting ranged mobs.\n\nThis is due to the fact that in the pillager.json and ranged piglin.json files, the component_groups have both minecraft:behavior.ranged_attack and minecraft:behavior.charge_held_item, so if a pillager does not have a crossbow, the charge_held_item behavior cannot trigger and it continuously shoots arrows due to the ranged_attack behavior.\n\nUnlike in Java Edition, the crossbows of pillagers in Bedrock Edition don't break.\n\n[8] Pillagers use a melee attack while underwater, unlike pillagers in Java Edition that maintain using crossbows underwater, although the shot arrows travel slower underwater and sink after a short distance.\n\nA player receives the Bad Omen status effect by drinking an Ominous Potion.\n\nThe effect lasts for 100 minutes (five in-game days) and can be removed by drinking milk.\n\nWhen a player afflicted with Bad Omen enters a village, a raid commences in that village, bringing about waves of illagers that seek and try to kill all villagers.\n\nEach patrol spawns one pillager captain.\n\nWhile outposts can continually spawn pillager captains, each captain inflicts the player who killed it with one level of Bad Omen upon death.\n\nRaid captains do not inflict Bad Omen when defeated in a raid.\n\nIn Java Edition, killing multiple captains in succession raises the Bad Omen level to a maximum of V, increasing the chance of pillagers and vindicators in the resulting raid wielding enchanted weapons.\n\nAs long as the Bad Omen level is higher than I, the resulting raid includes an additional wave with a raider composition identical to that of the last wave.\n\nJava Edition: Pillagers use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: \u2191 Due to a typo, the third sound for pillager celebrating is unused.\n\nSee MCPE-121058.\n\nJava Edition: Bedrock Edition: Pillagers have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Tags common to all mobs spawnable in raids Inventory: Each compound tag in this list is an item in the pillager's inventory, up to a maximum of 5 slots.\n\nItems in two or more slots that can be stacked together are automatically be condensed into one slot.\n\nPillagers don't change their inventory automatically or drop items from it upon death.\n\nThe inventory is currently unused.\n\n[more information needed ] An item in the inventory, excluding the Slot tag.\n\nTags common to all items Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nThis section would benefit from the addition of more images.\n\nPlease remove this notice once you've added suitable images to the article.\n\nThe specific instructions are: Pillagers before Bedrock Edition Beta 1.9.0.2.\n\nRenders of unarmed pillagers before and after 20w29a (MC-158735) Issues relating to \"Pillager\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nAlongside crossbows, pillagers were taken from Minecraft Dungeons, even though they were added to the base game first.\n\n[9] Pillagers were added in Village & Pillage as a means to give villagers a \"true\" adversary in order to balance the new village mechanics.\n\n[10] An original design of the pillager appeared like a pirate wearing an orange vest.\n\nHowever, Mojang Studios' mob designers changed the mob's design to look more like brigandine armor.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a running pillager uses the player's running animation rather than that of other illagers.\n\nSummoning an unarmed pillager in Java Edition that is invulnerable (/summon pillager ~ ~ ~ {Invulnerable:1b}) does not cause villagers to run away from the pillager.\n\nTyping /summon pillager ~ ~ ~ minecraft:calm in Bedrock Edition cause the summoned pillager to not attack players.\n\nA pillager has a 1 \u2044 16,000 chance of dropping a crossbow enchanted with two Piercing I enchantments, a 1 \u2044 409,000 chance of dropping one with Piercing I and Multishot and a 1 \u2044 3,500,000 chance of dropping one with Piercing I, Multishot, Unbreaking III and Quick Charge I.\n\nThese probabilities were calculated with pillagers spawned from patrols or outposts, because pillagers spawned from higher levels of raids have an increased chance of dropping enchanted crossbows.\n\nAlso with maximum regional difficulty, as this affects the chance of a dropped crossbow being enchanted.\n\nA pillager armed with a crossbow, shown at

attack players, adult villagers, wandering traders and iron golems by running at them and biting them.\n\nThey can be briefly stunned by being blocked with a shield, but after recovering they will roar, damaging and knocking away all nearby entities.\n\nRavagers spawn starting at wave 3 as part of a raid.\n\nUnridden ravagers spawn at wave 3, a ravager ridden by a pillager spawns at wave 5, and

~ minecraft:spawn_with_pillager_rider.\n\nUpon being killed, a ravager drops: A saddle, unaffected by Looting 20 experience orbs Ravagers, as well as piglin brutes, drop the most amount of experience orbs out of all non-boss entities.\n\nRavagers are hostile toward players, iron golems, adult villagers, and wandering traders within a 32-block radius.\n\nThey attack by ramming enemies with their head, dealing a knockback of 5 blocks.\n\nRavagers also attack by opening and closing their mouths, similar to biting their target.\n\nWhen ravagers see a villager and an iron golem together, they always prioritize villagers unless they are already attacking an iron golem.\n\nThey can also destroy certain block types by charging into them.\n\nIn Java Edition, ravagers can only break leaves and crops.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, they can break leaves, all crops, any other non-tree plants, mushrooms, and turtle eggs.\n\nHere is the complete list: Although ravagers are equipped with saddles, they cannot be ridden by the player.\n\nRavagers will only naturally appear ridden by an illager.\n\nHowever, another mob can be allowed to ride a ravager using the /ride command.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition ravagers have delayed hits hit_delay_pct: 0.5.\n\nWhen set to 0.0, ravager hits wouldn't be delayed to match Java Edition.\n\nWhen its bite attack is blocked by a shield, no damage is dealt and knockback is halved.\n\nA ravager also has a 50% chance to become stunned and unable to move or attack for 2 seconds.\n\nAfter this period, it will open its mouth and roar, dealing 6 damage and a knockback of 5 blocks to nearby entities.\n\nThe roar knocks back nearby illagers without damaging them and has no effect on other ravagers (note that vexes and witches are not treated as illagers and will take both damage and knockback).\n\nIllagers that are knocked back by a ravager's roar can still take fall damage.\n\nRavagers do not attack pillagers who shoot at them by accident, and do not attack evokers when evoker fangs accidentally hit them.\n\nWhen a vindicator riding a ravager has been named \"Johnny\" it may attack the ravager while it is riding it, but the ravager does not attack the vindicator for any reason.\n\nWhen a ravager gets shot by a mob that battles with a projectile while it is attacking the player, the ravager first attempts to kill who shot it, then goes back to

name for multiple snapshots and betas as Mojang listened for name suggestions from the community.\n\nIn Java Edition 19w05a and Bedrock Edition beta 1.11.0.1, illager beasts were named ravagers, although \"behemoth\" was also considered.\n\n[3] Ravagers were mainly inspired by the manticore, particularly the version from Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n[4] Ravagers have a vaguely bovine appearance, and are jokingly described as \"a spicy cow\" on the Minecraft.net page.\n\n[4] However, they cannot be milked.\n\nSeveral ravager sounds are altered versions of the sounds of other mobs: The first

    "content": "This article is about the mob.\n\nFor the block, see Shulker Box.\n\nFor the item, see Shulker Shell.\n\nShulker Open Closed View all renders Health 30 \u00d7 15 Behavior Hostile Passive (Peaceful difficulty) Spawn End city Damage 4 Levitation: Levitation for 10 seconds Usable items Dye  [Bedrock Edition only ] Details Size Closed: Height: 1 Block Width: 1 Block Peeking: Height: 1.2 Blocks Width: 1 Block Open: Height: 2 Blocks Width: 1 Block Armor 20 (\u00d7 10) when closed, 0 () when opened A shulker is a box-shaped hostile mob found in end cities.\n\nIt hides in its shell to protect itself and blend in with its surroundings.\n\nIt attacks by shooting homing bullets at the player which inflict Levitation.\n\nIt is the only source of shulker shells, which are used to craft shulker boxes.\n\nShulkers spawn during the generation of end cities, which are located on the outer islands of the End.\n\nThey usually spawn on the walls of the city and on end ships.\n\nThey do not despawn naturally, even in Peaceful difficulty.\n\nThere is a chance that a new shulker of the same color will spawn when a shulker is hit with a shulker bullet (including one of its own).\n\nThe following conditions need to be met: When the shulker gets hit and then has less than half its health remaining, there is a 25% chance it will try to teleport without spawning a new shulker instead of checking the conditions below.\n\nThe hit shulker must have its lid open.\n\nThe hit shulker needs to find somewhere to teleport.\n\nFor this, it takes a random block in a 17\u00d717\u00d717 cuboid centered on the shulker and then checks if the block has a valid face to teleport to.\n\nIf not it proceeds to try this up to 4 more times.\n\nIf no valid face is found, the attempt fails.\n\nEach other shulker within 8 blocks of the hit shulker decreases the odds of success by 20%.\n\nWhen five or more other shulkers are nearby, no shulkers will spawn, but the hit shulker still teleports.\n\nIf the attempt succeeds a new shulker spawns where the old shulker was before it teleported.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, shulkers drop 0\u20131 shulker shells.\n\nThe maximum can be increased by 1 per level of Looting, which is 0\u20134 shells with Looting III.\n\nIn Java Edition, shulkers have a 50% chance of dropping a shulker shell when killed.\n\nThis is increased by 6.25% per level of Looting, for a maximum of 68.75% with Looting III.\n\nShulkers also drop 5 when killed by a player or a tamed wolf.\n\nThe shell of the mob looks similar to a purpur block, blending in to its natural surroundings.\n\nInside the shell of the mob is a small yellow head with two eyes.\n\nShulkers are uncolored by default when using spawn eggs, while white is the default when using / summon or spawners.\n\nSpawning shulkers with other colors can be done using the / summon command, as detailed below.\n\nShulkers generally remain stationary, attached to an adjacent block with a full face.\n\n[1] However, if the block the shulker occupies becomes something other than air or the shulker finds itself not adjacent to any full face, or the shell cannot fully open (due to solid blocks or entities such as boats or other shulkers), it attempts to teleport (5 attempts per tick) to an air block within a 17\u00d717\u00d717 cube centered on the shulker where the shulker can attach to a full face and open.\n\nIf it finds no valid position to teleport onto it does not move.\n\nShulkers evaluate the collision box of scaffolding based on their current position, [2] which can result in the shulker teleporting to a position only to find it invalid and teleport again.\n\nShulkers occasionally open their shell for 1\u20133 seconds.\n\nWhen a target comes within about 16 blocks, it opens fully and shoots guided projectiles that follow the player, called shulker bullets, moving only along the X, Y, or Z axes and leaving trails of white particles.\n\nThe projectiles can be destroyed by attacking them or blocked with a shield.\n\nIf the projectile hits an entity, it does 4 of damage and inflicts the Levitation status effect for 10 seconds, this status effect has no effect underwater [3]  [Java Edition only ], or while riding a mob.\n\nThe shulker continues firing every 1\u20135.5 seconds while the target remains in range.\n\nIf the shulker's target dies with projectiles still in flight, they fall to the ground.\n\nShulkers can attack each other, in which case they shoot fully guided bullets at each other, but are unaffected by Levitation when hit.\n\nThe normal teleportation habits apply during these battles, and is likely to result in the duplication of more shulkers.\n\nWhen its shell is closed, a shulker has 20 (\u00d7 10) armor points and deflects arrows.\n\nWhen the shell opens, it loses this natural armor and takes damage as normal.\n\nWhen at less than half health, a shulker has a 25% chance of teleporting (as described above) after taking damage.\n\nWhen a shulker is attacked, other shulkers in the area target the attacker as well.\n\nShulkers don't take burning damage from lava or fire.\n\nThey drown in water, but try to teleport away when water or lava flows into the block they occupy.\n\nIn Peaceful difficulty, shulkers exist within the world, but do not attack, [4] like vindicators, evokers and piglin brutes in Bedrock Edition.\n\nShulkers are treated differently than true blocks.\n\nFor example, mobs are unable to pathfind around [5] or jump over them, [6] and falling on them from a height does not produce particles.\n\n[7] Their spawn egg also does not destroy blocks such as grass.\n\n[8] In Bedrock Edition, they apply Levitation II instead of I.\n\nShulkers spawned as part of a team using / summon attack most hostile mobs without provocation.\n\nThey never attack their teammates intentionally and do not retaliate even when being hit, however the shulkers will still target players without a team or in another team.\n\nShulker bullet Behavior Does not exist Details Size Height: 0.3125 Blocks Width: 0.3125 Blocks A shulker bullet is a guided projectile that is shot from shulkers, and they follow the targeted entity along the X, Y, or Z axis and leave trails of white particles.\n\nA shulker bullet that hits a mob or player deals damage and affects them with Levitation for ten seconds.\n\nThe shulker's projectiles also have entity data that control its movement.\n\nThe bullet can be destroyed by hitting it with any item, shooting it with an arrow, or blocking it with a shield.\n\nIt explodes upon contact with a block.\n\nThe explosion does not destroy any blocks and does not damage nearby mobs or players.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, shulkers can be dyed in a similar fashion to sheep.\n\nUsing a dye on a shulker gives it the color of the dye.\n\nIn Java Edition, the color of a shulker is changed through commands using the color byte tag.\n\nA shulker is transported in the Overworld by boat.\n\nPistons raise the boat uphill.\n\nShulkers can be moved by boats or minecarts; pushing a boat/cart into a shulker causes it to board.\n\nA boat's sides block some of a shulkers projectiles.\n\nA shulker pushed through the exit portal gets transported to the world spawn point in the Overworld.\n\nSince shulkers teleport when not adjacent to a solid block, they must be pushed down the central pillar of the exit portal (or a manually placed block directly above the portal) with a piston.\n\nJava Edition: Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Shulker bullets use

were simply made to be a similar shade of purple to purpur.\n\n[9] The word \"shulker\" is a portmanteau of \"shell lurker\".\n\n[10] [11] A shulker named ' Dinnerbone ' or ' Grumm ' flips

bottom), stairs have two (one side and top or bottom), and chests have none as they are slightly smaller than a full block.\n\n\u2191 When the shulker is at a Y position above the scaffolding block, the top is a full face and it will block opening.\n\nWhen at the same Y level as scaffolding unsupported from below, the bottom is a full face and it will block opening.\n\nOtherwise the scaffolding

block at a light level of zero in the Overworld except in mushroom fields and deep dark biomes, usually in small groups of up to four skeletons in Java Edition or two skeletons in Bedrock Edition.\n\n80% of skeletons spawned directly under the sky in snowy plains, ice spikes, frozen oceans, deep frozen oceans and legacy frozen oceans biomes spawn as stray mobs.\n\nSpiders have a very low chance of 1% to spawn with a skeleton riding them, creating a spider jockey.\n\nFour skeleton horsemen spawn when a skeleton horse trap is triggered, typically during a thunderstorm.\n\nThe skeletons ride on skeleton horses and are equipped with enchanted bows and iron helmets and, in Java Edition, have damage immunity for 3 seconds after spawning.\n\nSkeletons spawn from 25% of the monster spawners found in monster rooms.\n\nSkeletons spawn commonly in soul sand valleys, biomes of the Nether.\n\nHowever, existing skeletons lower the spawning chances of other hostile mobs nearby, meaning there are much less skeletons in a given area compared to zombified piglins in nether wastes.\n\nIn nether fortresses structures, there is a 20% chance that a skeleton spawns in place of a wither skeleton.\n\nA skeleton drops upon death: From zero to two bone s.\n\nThe maximum drop is increased by one per level of Looting, for a maximum of zero to five bones with Looting at the level three.\n\nFrom zero to two arrow s.\n\nThe maximum drop is increased by one per level of Looting, for a maximum of zero to five arrows with Looting at the level three.\n\nAny naturally spawned equipment, naturally its damaged and sometimes enchanted bow, has an 8.5% chance of dropping if killed by the player or a tamed wolf (9.5% with Looting one, 10.5% with Looting two and 11.5% with

killed by a player or a tamed wolf, and an extra 1\u20133 experience orbs for each piece of natural equipment that does not drop upon death.\n\nBecause all skeletons spawn with at least a bow, this

second on hard difficulty.\n\nIf the player leaves the 15-block radius, skeletons wait for some seconds with the bow charged, shooting the moment the player comes within range again.\n\nTheir detection range is reduced by 50% if a skeleton skull is worn by the player.\n\nThis stacks with sneaking and the Invisibility effect.\n\nThe skeleton's accuracy is based on the world difficulty.\n\nSkeletons have an \"error\" of 10 on Easy, 6 on Normal and 2 on Hard.\n\nThis is compared to the player's lack of accuracy of 1.\n\nTo account for gravity, skeletons aim 0.2 blocks higher for every horizontal block of range to the target.\n\nSkeletons have infinite durability on their bows, and can shoot an infinite amount of arrows.\n\nArrows shot by skeletons cannot be picked up from the ground.\n\nSkeleton behavior varies between the game editions: Java Edition Strafe in circular patterns to dodge attacks and retreat to a safe range if the player comes within 4 blocks.\n\nThey sometimes walk off cliffs while strafing.\n\n[1] Sprint toward the player if they are 14 blocks away or farther.\n\nUse bows even underwater.\n\nThe water slows down the arrows.\n\nAnimates its bow while attacking.\n\nBedrock Edition Skeletons typically stop moving to shoot, making no attempt to avoid being hit.\n\nAn underwater skeleton uses a melee attack because it is unable to use a bow underwater.\n\nA skeleton on land shoots quickly at a player in water.\n\nThe rate of fire increases as the player approaches, making combat difficult due to the knockback.\n\nIn most cases, if a skeleton's arrow hits a neutral or hostile mob that has not yet been attacked by the player, the mob attacks the skeleton.\n\nWhen a skeleton is attacked by another mob (including another skeleton), it attacks that mob, reorienting on the player once the mob is dead.\n\nSkeletons flee from wolves.\n\nA skeleton runs from a chasing wolf until the wolf deals damage, after which the skeleton turns to shoot at the wolf that successfully attacked it.\n\nDueling skeletons.\n\nOne skeleton turned red from being shot by the other skeleton.\n\nSkeletons sink in water and cannot swim, but do not drown.\n\nIf a skeleton is inside of powder snow for 7 seconds, it converts into a stray.\n\nA newly-converted stray always has full health even if converted from a damaged skeleton.\n\nThe converted stray keeps any items worn or held when it was a skeleton.\n\nOnly skeletons can become strays; wither skeletons cannot be converted.\n\nWolves attacking a skeleton.\n\nIf spawned with a weapon other than a bow, or no weapon at all (which can be spawned with commands such as / summon skeleton ~ ~ ~ {HandItems:[{Count:1,id:\"iron_sword\"}]}, or / summon skeleton ~ ~ ~ {}), a skeleton charges at a player with arms outstretched and deals damage by touch, similar to a wither skeleton.\n\nA skeleton holding a tipped arrow in its off-hand always shoots that type of arrow, and the arrow held is not consumed.\n\nIf a creeper dies from a skeleton's arrow, it drops one of any music discs except for Pigstep, Otherside, 5, and Relic.\n\nA skeleton burning in sunlight.\n\nSkeletons burn at dawn when the sun is 15 degrees or greater above the ground and when the moon can no longer be seen, unless the skeleton is: Below an opaque block.\n\nIn a sunlight level of 11 or less.\n\nIn water.\n\nStanding in soul sand.\n\nAffected by Fire Resistance.\n\nWearing a helmet, which absorbs the damage, wearing out completely after a long time, usually several day cycles.\n\nStanding in cobwebs.\n\n[2] If not wearing a helmet, it seeks out shade during the day or enters water to protect itself.\n\nUnlike zombies, which leave the shade to chase a player, skeletons do not exit the shaded area even while attacking.\n\nSkeletons are undead mobs, causing them to be damaged by the Instant Health status effect, healed by the Instant Damage status effect, and unaffected by the status effects Regeneration and Poison.\n\nSkeletons are ignored by the wither and are affected by the Smite enchantment.\n\nSome spawned skeletons have the ability to pick up dropped items from the ground.\n\nUnlike zombies, however, they pick up only weapons or armor.\n\nIf a picked up item is armor, a carved pumpkin or a mob head, a skeleton equips itself with the item.\n\nIf the picked up item is a weapon, the skeleton uses the item as a melee weapon.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, skeletons can also pick up and equip illager banners worn in their chest slot.\n\nSkeletons spawn already-armed with bows, which may be enchanted.\n\nThe chances of that event are listed below from code.\n\nIf a skeleton spawns wearing multiple pieces of armor, the armor is never mismatched (all pieces are made of the same material) except if it is spawned as part of a skeleton trap, in which case only the iron helmet may not match the rest of the armor.\n\n\u2191 a b c d e f g h i Value is based on the regional difficulty.\n\n\u2191 100% chance of a bow \u2191 a b Enchantment is the same as on an enchantment table at level 5\u201322.\n\n[note 1] If a skeleton does spawn with armor, the chances of specific armor are as follows: In Java Edition, the armor pieces go from feet to head, and in Bedrock Edition, they go from head to feet.\n\nThe chances of it being of a particular material are: The armor is not damaged from most damage sources; it cannot \"wear out\" the way player armor does.\n\nHelmets (not blocks like carved pumpkins) on skeletons can break if the skeleton is exposed to daylight or has an anvil or other falling block dropped on its hitbox.\n\nIf a skeleton has a bow and a sword is given, it drops the bow, with the same chance as if killed with Looting I and starts using the sword.\n\nIf a skeleton has a sword or bow in its hand, and one of a better type or with better enchantments is given, the skeleton drops the existing weapon, with the same chance as if killed with Looting I in favor of the better one.\n\nAny skeleton that spawns with equipment (picked-up items do not count) gives 1\u20133 extra experience points per item.\n\nIf multiple viable items exist, the skeleton endlessly picks up and drops the items.\n\n[3] On Halloween, skeletons may spawn wearing a carved pumpkin or jack o'lantern.\n\nThey do not drop this, even when killed with Looting.\n\nJava Edition: Skeletons use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: \u2191 MCPE-53297 Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Skeletons have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs StrayConversionTime: The number of ticks until this skeleton converts to a stray (default value is -1, when no conversion is under way).\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nHistorical sounds: Issues relating to \"Skeleton\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nIf alerted to a player 's presence, a skeleton can fire arrows backward, occasionally hitting themselves.\n\nSkeletons cannot see the player through glass, fences, or other transparent blocks.\n\nSkeletons and their variants do not know how to use a crossbow, despite the same using method as a bow.\n\nThe artificial intelligence of skeletons in Bedrock Edition is a mix of skeleton AI from Java Edition between versions 1.5 and 1.8.9 and the skeletons in Update Aquatic.\n\nThey shoot faster when they are on land and the target underwater, causing knockback enough to make combat hard.\n\nAdditionally, they do not strafe left to right, and they shoot more rapidly at closer targets.\n\nSkeletons also use ranged attacks on land and switch to melee attacks when sinking underwater.\n\nIn Java Edition, 89% of skeletons hold their bow in their right hand and 11% with the left.\n\nThis reflects estimated handedness percentages in the real world.\n\nIf a skeleton has a sword or any other melee item, generally with commands, its AI resembles the wither skeleton 's AI.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, skeletons do not animate their bow.\n\nC418 used bamboo wind chime sounds as a base for the skeleton sounds.\n\n[5] This page would benefit from the addition of

[Java Edition only ] Killing a baby skeleton horse yields no items or experience.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, killing a trap skeleton horse also yields no items or experience.\n\nSee also: Transportation Skeleton horses can be used as one of the fastest means of transportation in the game, though they are unable to fit through single block-wide openings.\n\nWhen ridden, they can also be used to climb hills and jump fences because the skeleton horses can jump up to five block heights, versus the player's maximum of one (without jump boost).\n\nThey can be ridden in water in any depth, and do so faster than non-skeleton horses.\n\nSkeleton horses sink in the water and can be ridden along the ocean or river floor.\n\nSkeleton horses can be pulled using a lead.\n\nGUI of a skeleton horse. [JE only ] Java Edition Skeleton horses have the following slot available: Saddle Slot: For equipping a saddle.\n\nSaddles can be placed on a tamed skeleton horse by holding it and then using on the skeleton horse, or by accessing its inventory.\n\nA skeleton horse's inventory can be accessed by mounting the skeleton horse and using inventory control, or by sneaking and then using on the skeleton horse.\n\nBaby skeleton horses cannot be equipped.\n\nBedrock Edition A skeleton horse does not have an inventory and cannot be equipped with a saddle or armor.\n\nDespite this, the default texture file, like those of normal horses, donkeys and mules, includes a chest.\n\nMain article: Riding In Bedrock Edition, skeleton horses can be controlled by the player without a saddle.\n\nHowever, in Java Edition, skeleton horses can be equipped with a saddle and then controlled.\n\nLike riding other entities, it is impossible for a player to use a nether portal or end portal while on a skeleton horse.\n\nThe player can control a tamed (and saddled Java Edition) skeleton horse with standard directional controls, jump, and the mouse.\n\nThe player dismounts using the dismount control.\n\nA player controlled skeleton horse automatically runs up any one block high slope.\n\nThe skeleton horse and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high.\n\nLower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block.\n\nThe horse itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks.\n\nSkeleton horses cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.\n\nPlayer controlled skeleton horses have the ability of \"jumping charging\".\n\nWhen the player rides them, the experience bar on HUD is replaced by jumping charging bar.\n\nA controlled skeleton horses can be made to jump and holding the control charges for a higher leap.\n\nSkeleton horses are not affected by jump boost beacons or potions.\n\nUnlike normal horses, a skeleton horse does not force the player to dismount when it is under water; rather, it can be ridden underwater without drowning.\n\nThe player can still drown underwater without the proper potions or enchantments, even when mounted on the skeleton horse.\n\nWhen underwater, its running speed and jump remain the same although it has a slower rate of descent.\n\nThe skeleton horse is an undead mob that is initially neutral, but become passive after their rider is killed.\n\nSkeleton horses behave like normal horses, roaming idly and occasionally stopping to rear or lower their heads as though eating the grass.\n\nUnlike sheep, the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed.\n\nSkeleton horses can breathe in water.\n\nUnlike other animal mobs, skeleton horses slowly regenerate health evident by their health bar while the player rides it.\n\nThis is the same case for normal horses.\n\nSkeleton horses cannot be bred or fed.\n\nSkeleton horses, in common with other undead mobs, take damage when affected by a Potion of Healing and are healed by a Potion of Harming.\n\nThey are also affected by the Smite enchantment.\n\nOther notes: In Java Edition, skeleton horses spawned by skeleton horse traps spawn tamed.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, skeleton horses are always tamed regardless of spawning conditions.\n\nThe skeleton horses are passive if the player kills the skeleton rider.\n\nThe skeleton wears an iron helmet, unless it randomly spawned with some other headgear.\n\nThe skeleton's bow and helmet are enchanted as if on an enchantment table at level 5\u201322.\n\nThe exact level depends on regional difficulty; on Easy it is always a level-5 enchantment.\n\nThe skeleton trap horse and the skeleton horse in a jockey are always adult.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the skeleton trap horse is not an adult nor a baby, though it looks like an adult.\n\nBaby skeleton horses can be spawned with a spawn egg.\n\nBaby skeleton horses cannot grow up normally In Bedrock Edition.\n\nThe skeleton in a naturally spawned skeleton horseman jockey does not despawn.\n\nA trap horse may spawn in areas that a regular horse may not, such as the middle of an ocean.\n\nA trap horse can trigger normally in clear weather (and often a player encounters a trap horse after the thunderstorm has cleared).\n\nThe skeleton drops more experience orbs.\n\nIf the difficulty is set to Peaceful, the skeleton riders disappear but the horses remain.\n\nThe skeleton does not shoot any mob that attacks the skeleton horse.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, skeleton horses will be killed by the Conduit like any regular hostile mob, despite being tamed.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Horses All horses have three \"equine stats\" that vary from horse to horse: health, maximum movement speed, and jump strength.\n\nThese stats are created once the horse is born or spawned, and are not affected by food.\n\nWhen spawned in any way except breeding \u2013 for instance, using commands, spawning naturally, spawning as part of a skeleton trap, or using spawn eggs \u2013 horses are assigned their stats within certain ranges, specific according to their horse type.\n\nA skeleton horse's health is always 15.\n\nDisplayed hearts are health, divided by two, rounded down.\n\nA horse with an odd number of health points (15, 17, 19, etc.) does not show the last half-heart.\n\nIf the horse has lost one health point lower than the inflicted damage and did not regenerate, it has an odd number of health points, otherwise, it has an even number of health points.\n\nSkeleton horse's speed is always 0.2; the player's normal walking speed is 0.1.\n\nThe speed listed does not include any status effect that affects the speed of a horse or a player.\n\nSee transportation to compare the speeds of various transportation methods.\n\nJump strength ranges from 0.4 to 1.0, averaging 0.7.\n\nA jump strength of 0.5 is enough to clear 1 19 \u2044 32 blocks, while 1.0 is enough to clear 5 9 \u2044 32 blocks.\n\nThe jump strengths required to clear several block heights are: Skeleton horse sounds are the sounds of the regular horse but lower pitched and slowed with reverb.\n\nJava Edition: Skeleton horses use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b MC-177091 \u2191 The precise equation is as follows: velocity = sqrt  (speed.x 2 \u00d7 0.2 + speed.y 2 + speed.z 2 \u00d7 0.2) {\\displaystyle \\text{velocity}=\\operatorname{sqrt}(\\text{speed.x}^2\\times0.2+\\text{speed.y}^2+\\text{speed.z}^2\\times0.2)} volume = {\\displaystyle \\text{volume}=} (whichever is smaller) 0.1 or (velocity \u00d7 10 {\\displaystyle \\text{velocity}\\times10} if being ridden and velocity \u00d7 8.75 {\\displaystyle \\text{velocity}\\times8.75} if not) \u2191 a b MC-177090 Bedrock Edition: \u2191 This sound event would occur if skeleton horses could have armor equipped.\n\n\u2191 This sound event would occur if skeleton horses could have a chest equipped.\n\n\u2191 Except for stems, Nether wood, cherry wood, and bamboo wood due to MCPE-165012 Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Skeleton horses have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Additional fields for mobs that can breed Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Tags common to all horses SkeletonTrap: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the horse is a trapped skeleton horse.\n\nDoes not affect horse type.\n\nSkeletonTrapTime: Incremented each tick when SkeletonTrap is set to 1.\n\nThe horse automatically despawns when it reaches 18000 (15 minutes).\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Skeleton horse\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nDr.\n\nZhark appears in the credits after the End Poem as the creator of the horses, including skeleton horses.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, skeleton horses can be transported in a boat by riding the skeleton horse and jumping into the boat then dismounting (leaving the horse behind in the boat) and activating the boat from underneath/underwater.\n\nAttempting to activate the boat in order to pilot it from above results in the player being mounted on the horse again rather than being placed inside the boat to pilot it.\n\nA skeleton horse spawned in.\n\nThe four variations of skeleton traps using \"Grumm\" or \"Dinnerbone\" name tags.\n\nSkeleton horses spawned from a trapped skeleton horse.\n\nA player riding a skeleton horse, having killed the skeleton rider.\n\nA player riding a skeleton horse underwater.\n\nIt can run and jump.\n\nSkeleton horse with saddle [Java Edition only ] in survival after defeating the skeleton horse trap.\n\nA skeleton horse in Minecraft Education.\n\nLego Minecraft Skeleton Horse.\n\nHorse Donkey Mule Skeleton \u2191 \"Also big thanks to @DrZhark, the creator of Mo' Creatures, that have assisted us to make it happen!\" \u2013 @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X, April 4, 2013 \u2191 MC-129262 \u2191 MC-121832 \u2191 MC-166246 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\nEntities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

    "content": "This article is about the mob.\n\nFor the item it drops, see Slimeball.\n\nFor the block created with slimeballs, see Slime Block.\n\nFor other uses, see Slime (disambiguation).\n\nSlime Health Big: 16 \u00d7 8 Medium: 4 Small: 1 Behavior Hostile Spawn see \u00a7 Spawning Damage Easy: Big: 3 Medium: 2 Small: 0 Normal: Big: 4 Medium: 2 Small: 0 Hard: Big: 6 Medium: 3 Small: 0 Details Size Big: Height: 2.08 Blocks Width: 2.08 Blocks Medium: Height: 1.04 Blocks Width: 1.04 Blocks Small: Height: 0.52 Blocks Width: 0.52 Blocks Slimes are bouncy, cube-shaped hostile mobs that spawn deep underground in particular chunks, or in swamp biomes.\n\nThey attack by jumping at their targets, come in three sizes and larger slimes can split into smaller ones on death.\n\nSlimes spawn in the Overworld in specific \"slime chunks\" below layer 40, regardless of light levels.\n\nThey can also spawn in swamp biomes between layers 51 and 69 (inclusive) in light levels of 7 or less, with these layers tending to be near the surface.\n\nSlimes spawn regardless of weather conditions.\n\nOnly sizes 1, 2, and 4 (NBT Size tag values 0, 1 and 3 respectively) spawn naturally.\n\nWith use of / summon, slimes can potentially range from size 1 to 127 (NBT Size tag 0\u2013126).\n\n[verify ] Like most other hostile mobs, slimes do not spawn within 24 blocks (spherical) of any player, despawn over time if no player is within 32 blocks, and despawn instantly if no player is within the despawn radius (128 blocks in Java Edition, 44 to 128 blocks in Bedrock Edition depending on simulation distance [verify ]).\n\nA slime needs roughly a 3\u00d72.1x3 free space to spawn.\n\nThe area in which the slime spawns must be clear of solid or liquid obstructions.\n\nWhen a slime attempts to spawn, the game checks for the space requirement of a large slime, and the size is determined later.\n\nTherefore, since large slimes are slightly taller than 2 blocks, no slimes, regardless of size, are able to spawn at all in 2-block-high areas.\n\nAlso, since large slimes are slightly wider than 2 blocks, and mobs spawn at the center of a block, having any block within the 3\u00d72.1x3 area, even as thin as a glass pane, can prevent a slime of any size from spawning.\n\nSlime size is affected by regional difficulty: chances range from 33% for each size at the low difficulty to 16% small, 33% medium, and 50% big with higher difficulty.\n\nSlimes can spawn on some light-emitting blocks: Amethyst Bud Blast Furnace Brown Mushroom Cave Vines Crying Obsidian Furnace Glow Lichen Glowing Obsidian Jack o'Lantern Redstone Lamp Redstone Torch Respawn Anchor (0-3 charges only) Smoker Soul Torch Torch In swamps and mangrove swamps, slimes may spawn between the heights of 51 and 69 (inclusive) when the provided light level is 7 or less.\n\nThey spawn most often on a full moon, and never on a new moon.\n\nMore precisely, the game checks two factors: If the light level is equal to or less than a random integer (from 0 to 7) If the fraction of the moon that is bright is greater than a random number (from 0 to 1) If these conditions are met and the altitude is acceptable, there is a 50% chance of spawning a slime.\n\nThe light level requirement for slime spawning in swamps is different from that of most hostile mobs, which only spawn at light level 0.\n\n[1] Slimes spawn throughout the world (except mushroom fields and deep dark biomes) below level Y=40 regardless of light level, but only in certain chunks; 1 \u2044 10 of all chunks.\n\nIn Java Edition, these \"slime chunks\" are determined pseudo-randomly by combining their chunk coordinates with the seed of the world: import java.util.Random; public class checkSlimechunk {public static boolean isSlimeChunk (long worldSeed, int xPosition, int zPosition) {Random rnd = new Random (worldSeed + (int) (xPosition * xPosition * 0x4c1906) + (int) (xPosition * 0x5ac0db) + (int) (zPosition * zPosition) * 0x4307a7L + (int) (zPosition * 0x5f24f) ^ 0x3ad8025fL);

} } That is, using the chunk coordinates to help generate a seed, a random number between 0 and 9 inclusive is generated.\n\nIf that number is 0, the chunk can spawn slimes.\n\nTo convert world coordinates to chunk coordinates, divide by 16 and round down.\n\nNote that xPosition, and zPosition are 32-bit integers (int s).\n\nAs per Java Edition 1.20.5 snapshot 24W13A, 2 slimes can spawn whenever any entity affected by Oozing is killed.\n\nThe slime chunk algorithm in Bedrock Edition is different from in Java Edition.\n\nThe algorithm doesn't depend on the world seed, thus the chunks that slimes can naturally spawn in inhabit the same coordinates for every world.\n\n[2] If a slime's size is 1, it drops 0-2 slimeballs unless killed by a frog.\n\nThis can be increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 5 slimeballs.\n\nWhen killed by a frog, it always drops 1 slimeball.\n\nSlimes also drop experience points equal to their size: 4 for large slimes, 2 for medium slimes, or 1 for small slimes.\n\nBecause slimes split into 2-4 smaller slimes when they die, a player can earn a possible maximum of 28 experience points from killing one large slime and all the slimes that split from it.\n\nA slime jumping.\n\nSlimes move by hopping, which they do every 10 to 30 ticks (1 \u2044 2 to 1 1 \u2044 2 seconds), and can swim in water and climb ladders and scaffolding.\n\nUnlike other mobs, slimes continue moving when no players are nearby.\n\nTheir exact routine is as follows: The slime searches for a player (or, failing that, an iron golem) within 16 blocks (spherical) distance.\n\nIf no target is found, the slime waits 10 to 30 ticks (1 \u2044 2 to 1 1 \u2044 2 seconds) between jumps, and changes direction randomly every 40 to 100 ticks (2 to 5 seconds).\n\nIf a target is found, the delay before jumping is 1 \u2044 3 as long (3 to 10 ticks), and the slime's direction is set directly toward the target before jumping.\n\nUnlike most mobs, slimes do not pathfind towards their target, always approaching their target in a straight line, without avoiding environmental hazards such as lava, cactus or dangerous falls.\n\nThis means they can easily get stuck in corners or behind walls, not knowing how to circumvent them.\n\nThis behavior is shared by magma cubes.\n\nA slime's maximum health is equal to its size squared, and its dimensions are 0.51 blocks times its size in each dimension.\n\nWhen a slime attacks, it deals damage equal to its size, except for size 1 (smallest) slimes, which do no damage, and do not prevent sleeping.\n\nBecause small slimes still have a hostile AI, they continuously attack the player.\n\nA slime's jump distance also depends on its size; a slime jumps a distance slightly farther than its length.\n\nWhen landing, a number (8 times the slime's size) of slime particles appear.\n\nSlimes will always, regardless of size, jump 1 block high.\n\nWhen a slime larger than 1 dies, it spawns 2-4 new slimes equivalent to its size divided by 2, rounding down.\n\nA slime that was named with a name tag produces smaller slimes with the same name when it dies.\n\nSlimes continuously damage all players and iron golems  [JE only ] they collide with (although damage immunity reduces the actual damage to 1 attack every half second), unlike other mobs that damage only those targets they specifically attack.\n\n[3] Slimes in water attempt to swim to the surface if possible.\n\nIf forced to stay submerged, they eventually drown, splitting into smaller slimes that drown and finally drop slimeballs.\n\nJava Edition: Slimes use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Slimes have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Size: The size of the slime.\n\nNote that this value is zero-based, so 0 is the smallest slime, 1 is the next larger, etc.\n\nThe sizes that spawn naturally are 0, 1, and 3.\n\nValues that are greater than 126 get clamped to 126.\n\nwasOnGround: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the slime is touching the ground.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nNote: This video is from 2012.\n\nSince then, slime spawning in swamps has been added to the game.\n\nIssues relating to \"Slime\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nIn Java Edition, with commands, the size of slimes can be customized.\n\nSizes go from 1 up to 127; the size-127 slime is the largest of any mob in the game, bigger than the ender dragon.\n\nBecause a slime's movement speed is tied to its size it becomes impossible for the player to outrun a size 8 slime on flat ground without potion effects.\n\nWhen a slime searches for nearby targets or checks to see if it should despawn, it checks from a point at the center of its hitbox on the x and z-axis and the bottom of its y-axis.\n\nTherefore, a custom-size slime sufficiently huge can be right in front of the player and be completely passive, and it may even despawn if the slime is large enough.\n\nThe slime is the most effecient source of exp without farms, easy to kill, high spawn rates in swamps and slime chunks, and deal super low damage to you with armor.\n\nGreen-colored Slimes are also present in Minicraft, a 2D Minecraft -inspired game also created by Notch.\n\nIf a player walks inside a slime, they can see the slime itself inside of a slime block.\n\nif the player looks at the corner of a glass block, the slime inside the slime block disappears, looking like the slime block is alive.\n\nSmall: 0.6 block cube.\n\nMedium: 1.2 block cube.\n\nBig: 2.4 block cube.\n\nSlimes of various sizes underground.\n\nA big slime covering a minecart.\n\nA group of slimes within a Superflat world.\n\nA group of slimes within a village.\n\nA group of slimes within a swamp.\n\nThe largest possible slime size: size 127.\n\nA size 10 slime compared to an oak tree.\n\nA group of slimes within a cave.\n\nA group of three slimes are led out of a cave onto the surface.\n\nA slime within pocket edition alpha.\n\nA group of slimes within the promotional artwork for the first Caves & Cliffs update.\n\nA slime within Minecraft Dungeons.\n\nPrison Slimes, a slime variant that can be found within Minecraft Story Mode Season 2.\n\nA Slime Spirit within Super Smash Bros.\n\nUltimate.\n\nA LEGO slime.\n\n\"Frogs,\" an official T-Shirt design featuring two slimes.\n\nMagma Cube \u2013 A similar mob that spawns only in the Nether and drops magma cream Tropical Slime - A variant that is found in Minecraft Earth \u2191 MC-252424 \u2014 \"Slimes spawn at light levels greater then 0 in Swamps\" \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 The Bedrock Edition slime chunk algorithm was reverse engineered by @protolambda and @jocopa3 and can be found on GitHub: [1] \u2191 MC-131426 \u2191 http://getsatisfaction.com/mojang/topics/will_slimes_ever_return_to_minecraft \u2191 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyNvBkn4E3U \u2191 MC-97958 \u2191 MC-48923 \u2014 \"Slime/magma cubes not affected by jump boost potion effect\" \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 MC-118616 \u2014 \"The sounds of magma cubes and slimes aren't controlled by the \"Hostile Creatures\" sound slider\" \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\nEntities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

each use reduces 10% of the remaining time to grow up.\n\nDespite their hostile nature, killer bunnies can breed with other rabbits and with each other, having the unusual chance of creating a baby killer bunny.\n\nA Toast rabbit does not produce a Toast rabbit baby, however.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, baby rabbits follow their parents; this behavior is absent in Java Edition.\n\n[2] The six natural types of rabbits.\n\nRabbits typically spawn using one of six different skins.\n\nSkins include regular brown fur, white fur with red eyes (albino), black mottled fur, black and white spotted fur, gold (cream) fur, and salt and pepper fur.\n\nThe biome determines the skin used: Rabbits in snowy biomes have 80% white fur and 20% black and white fur.\n\nRabbits in deserts have 100% gold fur.\n\nRabbits in other biomes have 50% brown fur, 40% salt & pepper fur, and 10% black fur.\n\nRabbits with specific skins can be spawned using / summon rabbit ~ ~ ~ {RabbitType: (Number from 0 - 5)}  [Java Edition only ] or / summon rabbit ~ ~ ~ in_desert (gold)/in_snow (white)  [Bedrock Edition only ].\n\nWhile it is possible to go above 5, this results in rabbits with skins identical to RabbitType: 0, with the exception of RabbitType: 99, the Killer Bunny.\n\nThere are two special variants of rabbits: This feature is exclusive to Java Edition.\n\nThe current killer bunny texture The killer bunny is an aggressive variant of the rabbit exclusive to Java Edition that is hostile toward players, foxes, and wolves.\n\nIts fur is pure white with blood-red eyes that are horizontal, compared to a normal rabbit's vertical eyes.\n\nIt can be spawned only by using the / summon rabbit ~ ~ ~ {RabbitType:99} command.\n\nIt appears with a nameplate over its head reading \"The Killer Bunny\".\n\nIf the killer bunny finds any player within a 16-block radius, it hops toward the player much faster than a normal rabbit.\n\nIt moves in a style similar to that of a spider.\n\nOnce it closes in, it jumps at the player, dealing 8 damage on Normal difficulty.\n\nIf the player strikes at the killer bunny, it runs away for a brief moment, then returns to lunging at the player.\n\nKiller bunnies are immune to the Thorns enchantment.\n\nIf it cannot find a player, the killer bunny actively seeks out and attacks any foxes or wolves, including tamed wolves.\n\nThese mobs, in return, attack the killer bunny, leading to a vicious fight.\n\nOn peaceful difficulty, the killer bunny does not despawn, despite its hostile nature.\n\nIt still attacks wolves and tamed wolves, but not the player.\n\nThe killer bunny can be bred and leashed and follows players holding carrots, despite its hostile nature.\n\n\"Toast\" redirects here.\n\nFor messages displayed on-screen, see Toasts, Advancements, Recipes, or Tutorial hints.\n\nFor Bread, see Bread.\n\nThe rabbit named \"Toast\" Naming a rabbit Toast (using either a name tag or a renamed spawn egg) re-textures it to have the appearance of a black Dutch, with a large black and white patch and more black fur around the face than the natural black and white spotted rabbit.\n\nOther than its name and skin, Toast behaves exactly like it would if it were unnamed.\n\nWhen Toast rabbits are bred, whether with each other or with regular rabbits, their offspring do not have the Toast pattern; they have a pattern consistent with the parents' original coloring prior to renaming.\n\nIf the player renames a killer bunny to Toast, it still attacks players and wolves.\n\nLike the killer bunny, Toast does not spawn naturally.\n\nThis rabbit is the skin of user xyzen420's girlfriend's missing rabbit, which Ryan Holtz implemented as a memorial.\n\n[3] Java Edition: Regular rabbits use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nKiller bunnies use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Rabbits have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Additional fields for mobs that can breed Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs MoreCarrotTicks: Set to 40 when a carrot crop is eaten, decreases by 0\u20132 every tick until it reaches 0.\n\nHas no effect in game.\n\nRabbitType: Determines the skin of the rabbit.\n\nAlso determines if rabbit should be hostile.\n\nMain article: Rabbit/DV [edit ] Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nNote: this video is outdated as rabbits can no longer be tamed, rabbits are smaller now, and the killer rabbit is now called the killer bunny.\n\nIssues relating to \"Rabbit\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe Killer Bunny is a reference to the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog from the British comedy film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which it was formerly named.\n\nThe Killer Bunny was suggested by X user @88bully.\n\n[7] The death sound for the rabbit is called bunnymurder.ogg.\n\nA brown rabbit running.\n\nRyan Holtz modeling the rabbit.\n\nThe first image of a rabbit tweeted by Ryan Holtz.\n\nThe second image of a rabbit tweeted by Ryan Holtz.\n\nThe third image of a rabbit tweeted by Ryan Holtz.\n\nThe fourth image of a rabbit tweeted by Ryan Holtz.\n\nThe fifth image of a rabbit tweeted by Ryan Holtz.\n\nBaby rabbits.\n\nFirst image of Toast.\n\nSecond image of Toast.\n\nThird image of Toast.\n\nFourth image of Toast.\n\nThe first image of the Killer Bunny.\n\nThe second image of the Killer Bunny.\n\nA pen of rabbits.\n\nThe second Killer Bunny texture, similar to a normal white rabbit.\n\nAll of the available rabbit skins.\n\nThe Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog as a baby.\n\nThe third Killer Bunny texture, with blood on its mouth and paws.\n\nKiller bunny.\n\nA rabbit eating a carrot.\n\nLego Minecraft Black Rabbit.\n\nLego Minecraft Baby Brown Rabbit.\n\nA rabbit in official artwork for The Wild Update.\n\nRabbit art.\n\nJumbo Rabbit from Minecraft Earth.\n\nA rabbit preparing to shoot Steve with a crossbow.\n\n[8] The White Rabbit texture in Bedrock Edition 1.9.\n\n\u2191 MC-207993 \u2191 MC-158608 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 \"@xyZenTV The skin only appears when you name the rabbit Toast using a name tag, it isn't in the random pool:\" \u2013 @TheMogMiner (Ryan Holtz) on X, July 1, 2014 \u2191 https://minecraft.net/article/who-framed-killer-rabbit \u2191 \"FYI, I asked Josh to remove this feature again.\n\nAlthough funny, being scared of rabbits doesn't fit with the Beast's lore.\" \u2013 @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X, October 30, 2018 \u2191 MC-96449 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 \"@88bully @xyZenTV You, I like you.\n\nI like the way you think.\n\nHowever, no promises.\n\nPromises are made to be broken.\" \u2013 @TheMogMiner (Ryan Holtz) on X, June 6, 2014 \u2191 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-85xXgFHlE Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

[BE only ] In Bedrock Edition, vindicators are passive to players on Peaceful difficulty but will still attack other mobs.\n\nWhile idle, a vindicator crosses its arms similar to a villager, with its axe stowed.\n\nWhile giving chase, the vindicator brandishes its axe and sprints.\n\nIf it has no weapons, a mainhand-unarmed vindicator raises both of its hands when attacking.\n\nOn Normal and Hard difficulties, vindicators that are part of a raid can break wooden doors.\n\nThis is controlled by the raider tag.\n\n[1] Like any illager during a raid, vindicators celebrate by cheering if all the villagers are killed or all the beds are destroyed.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, if a pillager arrow accidentally strikes a vindicator, the vindicator retaliates against the pillager, but the pillager does not retaliate.\n\nAll illagers remain friendly to each other in Java Edition, even when struck accidentally.\n\n[2] Vindicators are likely to call help from other vindicators when attacked by mobs or players (except for illagers and goats, or if they were killed in one hit), inciting them all to attack the aggressor.\n\nThey do not call help from other kinds of illagers.\n\nVindicator raiders can break doors and open doors like villagers.\n\n[needs testing ] Ringing a bell gives all vindicators within 32 blocks the Glowing effect for 3 seconds.\n\nVindicators can only sprint, even when idle.\n\nA dispenser can equip a vindicator with armor, but it is invisible and does not show on its model.\n\nArmed vindicators hit for 7.5 \u00d7 3.75 to 19.5 \u00d7 9.75 damage, depending on difficulty.\n\nThey tie with piglin brutes for dealing the third most melee damage in the game, following the iron golem at 21 \u00d7 10.5 damage and the warden at 45 \u00d7 22.5 damage.\n\nThe vindicator's axe attack disables the player's shield for 5 seconds, even when riding a ravager.\n\nA vindicator named Johnny (using a name tag, named spawn egg, etc., or has its Johnny tag set to 1b) is hostile to every mob except evokers, pillagers, other vindicators, ghasts [3] and players in Creative or Spectator mode.\n\nIn Java Edition, they also do not attack baby villagers, illusioners or armor stands [4].\n\nThis hostility extends to vexes, ravagers and witches in both editions.\n\n[5] \"Johnny\" vindicators will also attempt to attack the ender dragon, but it will not take damage.\n\nAll hostile or neutral mobs try to attack the \"Johnny\" vindicator in return, except for ender dragons, [verify ] endermites (as they die in one hit), guardians, elder guardians, phantoms, goats (apart from their usual ramming behavior), slimes, magma cubes, and ravagers.\n\nSince raid captains can instruct nearby pillagers to attack their target, naming a vindicator raid captain \"Johnny\" will cause other raiders to attack Johnny's target, even if they wouldn't usually.\n\nThis can cause witches, vexes and ravagers to target one another, and can even cause ravagers to attack themselves.\n\nIf this causes a witch to target a ravager, the witch will instead throw Splash Potions of healing, since ravagers are raid mobs.\n\nThe Johnny tag overrides its name; the player can give the vindicator any other name and set the Johnny tag to 1b and it remains hostile in the same way as described.\n\nConversely, the player can name the vindicator \" Johnny \" and set the Johnny tag to 0b, causing the vindicator to act as a normal vindicator.\n\nNaming a \"Johnny\" vindicator something else using a name tag will not set its Johnny tag to 0b, and it will continue to exhibit \"Johnny\" behavior. [Java Edition only ] Naming a vindicator spawn egg \"Johnny\" and using it on a spawner has no effect; normal vindicators spawn rather than vindicators named \"Johnny\".

    "content": "This article is about a hostile monster mob in Minecraft.\n\nFor the unseen illager in Minecraft Dungeons, see MCD:Warden.\n\nFor the ancient mob in Minecraft Dungeons, see MCD:Frostwarden.\n\nFor the character in Minecraft: Story Mode, see Minecraft Story Mode:The Warden.\n\nThis page uses many images.\n\nIt is not recommended for people with limited or slow internet connections to read through this page.\n\nWarden Health 500 \u00d7 250 Behavior Hostile Spawn When a player activates naturally generated sculk shriekers three times or more Damage Melee: Easy: 16 \u00d7 8 Normal: 30 \u00d7 15 Hard: 45 \u00d7 22.5 Ranged: Easy: 6 Normal: 10 Hard: 15 \u00d7 7.5 Details Size Height: 2.9 blocks Width: 0.9 blocks Warden is an extremely powerful hostile mob summoned by sculk shriekers in the deep dark biome.\n\nIt attacks by swinging its arms downward, dealing the strongest melee damage of all mobs, and can also release a sonic boom attack that immediately strikes the target, piercing through obstacles and deals damage that cannot be reduced except by the Resistance effect.\n\nWardens are completely blind and rely on vibrations, smell, and touch to detect players and mobs, and can therefore be evaded via sneaking, diversions (snowballs, arrows, etc.) and wool.\n\nA warden emerges from the ground after being summoned by sculk shriekers Wardens do not use standard mob spawning mechanics.\n\nThey are instead spawned when a player activates naturally generated sculk shriekers three times and if there isn't already another warden within 24 blocks of it.\n\nA warden spawns by emerging from the ground near the shrieker that summoned it, taking about 6.7 seconds to do so and being completely invulnerable until fully emerged.\n\nThe warning count for sculk shriekers is specific to each player rather than each sculk shrieker.\n\nThis means that the player can activate three different shriekers in different locations and a warden emerges after the third activation.\n\nThe light level does not have an effect on warden spawning.\n\nUp to 20 attempts are made to spawn a warden within an 11\u00d713\u00d711 cubic area, which is centered on the shrieker.\n\nDuring each attempt, the game picks a random column from the y axis, then the game picks the topmost block in that column with a top surface with full collision and the block above must have no collision (the spawning warden cannot collide with any existing entities or liquids; wardens must not have water inside their spawn block, where their feet go, but they can spawn with water in the second and third block.\n\nFor example, a pressure plate with water flowing on top is still a valid location).\n\nIn Java Edition, warden spawning can be toggled on or off with the game rule doWardenSpawning.\n\nA warden drops a single sculk catalyst upon death, unaffected by Looting.\n\nIt also drops 5 experience if killed by either a player or a tamed wolf.\n\nA warden is blind and seeks out targets by sensing vibrations and by sniffing.\n\nAfter spawning, wardens wander randomly around the world and move toward nearby vibrations originating from players, mobs and non-mob sources including projectiles and minecarts.\n\nA warden also periodically sniffs the area around it, allowing it to zero in on targets even if they don't create vibrations.\n\nIf a warden is actively sniffing and it picks up a nearby vibration, movement, or action then it will become increasingly agitated.\n\nThis effect applies to players, blocks, and other entities.\n\nA warden can fit inside any space that is 1 block wide and 3 blocks tall, allowing it to chase players and mobs through small corridors.\n\nWardens are immune to damage from fire or lava and do not take knockback.\n\nThey pursue through blocks that are usually avoided by other mobs, including rails [1], cacti, or magma blocks.\n\nA warden, whether angered or not, gives 12 seconds of Darkness to all players within a 20 block radius of it every 6 seconds.\n\nThe souls in its chest make a low heartbeat that occurs in tandem with the Darkness effect.\n\nThe heartbeat speeds up as the warden becomes increasingly agitated.\n\n[2] A warden prefers to track down the most suspicious targets, rather than the ones closest to it.\n\n[3] A warden listens to all vibrations within a 16 block radius, except those from other wardens, armor stands, dying mobs and players in Creative or Spectator mode.\n\nLike with sculk sensors, they cannot detect vibrations from a sneaking player that is moving, jumping, falling or shooting a projectile.\n\nA warden has a 2-second cooldown between detecting vibrations.\n\nA warden is aware of all targetable entities within a 49\u00d751\u00d749 box around itself.\n\nIf the warden has a targetable entity, is not investigating any disturbances, and is otherwise idle, it pathfinds toward the closest entity, prioritizing players over mobs.\n\nWhile pathfinding, the warden can begin a 'sniff' behavior and animation.\n\nThis takes around 4.2 seconds and has a 5-10 seconds cooldown.\n\nA warden can still sniff out sneaking players, despite that they cannot detect vibrations from them.\n\nWardens keep track of how angry they are at each suspect as a number from 0 to 150.\n\nWhen a warden notices a vibration, it adds anger to the player or mob that caused the vibration.\n\nIt adds 10 anger if the vibration was from a projectile or 35 anger for other vibrations.\n\nHowever, if two projectiles from the same player/mob are heard by the warden within five seconds, it instead adds the full 35 anger toward that player/mob.\n\nWardens do not add anger toward a mob/player if the projectile was shot from more than 30 blocks away, although the projectile does count toward the counter of two projectiles.\n\nAnger decays at a rate of 1 per second and immediately clears if the targeted player switches to Creative or Spectator modes, the target or warden leaves the dimension, or if the target dies.\n\nA warden adds 35 anger toward any mob that directly touches it.\n\nThis effect has a 1-second cooldown.\n\nWhen it finishes sniffing, a warden adds 35 anger to the nearest mob or player within 6 blocks horizontally and 20 blocks vertically, a cylindrical volume centered on the warden.\n\nOnce a warden reaches 80 anger with a target, it roars for 4.2 seconds, adds another 20 anger, and pursues the target.\n\nIn this angered state, the warden chases the target normally despite being blind.\n\nA warden also enters its hostile state and adds 100 anger if directly attacked by a mob.\n\nIf the attacking player or mob is within 5 blocks, it skips its roaring animation altogether and immediately gives chase.\n\nA warden is biased toward player vibrations, attacks, and contact - even if a warden is angrier at another mob, it still attacks the player first as long as they have angered the warden as well.\n\nThis is not true of any other mob.\n\n[4] After 60 seconds of being \"calm\" and not detecting any vibrations or sniffing any mobs, a warden burrows back into the ground and despawns, unless it has been named.\n\nIf the warden is floating on a liquid, it instead immediately despawns without any burrowing animation.\n\nDuring its emerging/burrowing animation, a warden cannot detect any vibrations, and can take damage only from / kill, though it can still be pushed by entities, pistons, or liquids.\n\nNamed wardens do not dig or despawn.\n\nThe only exception to this rule are wardens spawned as part of a team [Java Edition only ] through the / summon command immediately digs and despawn upon spawning, ignoring everything else in the process regardless of whether it spawned with a name, with PersistenceRequired:1 or not.\n\nA warden's melee attack has a cooldown of 0.9 seconds and disables shields for 5 seconds, dealing 16 \u00d7 8 to 45 \u00d7 22.5 health points depending on the difficulty.\n\nThe Warden's sonic boom attack If a warden cannot reach its target, it switches to its ranged attack: a sonic boom.\n\nIt does so when the following are true: It has been 10 seconds since the warden detected the target It has been 5 seconds since the warden last used a melee or ranged attack The target is within 15 blocks horizontally and 20 blocks vertically of the warden.\n\nThe sonic boom aims directly at the target, making it impossible to dodge, passing through blocks and other mobs without damaging them.\n\nA warden takes 1.7 seconds to charge and unleashes the attack, which instantly hits the target as long as the target is within attack range.\n\nThe attack takes an additional 1.3 seconds to cool down before the warden can use melee attacks again for a total of 3 seconds.\n\nThe sonic boom is visible via green-blue particles that are projected out of the warden's chest in a 20 blocks radius.\n\nThis attack bypasses shields, armor, enchantments, blocks and even the wither armor of the wither.\n\nOnly the Resistance status effect can reduce this attack's damage.\n\nJava Edition: Wardens use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition:

format/Entity format.\n\nKilling a warden doesn't count for the Monster Hunter advancement nor is it needed to receive the Monsters Hunted advancement.\n\n[5] [6] Issues relating to \"Warden\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nAlthough the warden is supposed to be blind, spectating it reveals that it still has normal vision.\n\n[10] The concept for the warden was originally planned for the Nether Update as a \"blind piglin that could only respond to sounds\" that could be found within a \"new biome\".\n\n[11] Brandon Pearce considers the warden as something entirely new as it isn't a boss or a mini boss (in spite of having the combined health of the wither and ender dragon) or a regular enemy but a force of nature: \"when a tornado is barreling towards you, you don't try to kill it - you run away!\n\nThe warden is exactly the same.\" [12] Brandon's thought process on finally giving the warden a drop after he was heavily against it was the warden should never drop something that is important or hard to get that would be worth going through the trouble of fighting it.\n\nIn this case, fighting a warden is not worth a sculk catalyst.\n\nThis change was made for renewability farms and tech players.\n\n[13] When Chi Wong was working the warden's digging animation he wanted to make sure the timing was right and make sure while it was going down, it's not going down like an elevator, but it actually digs, and the feeling Chi wanted to convey with it is it has tons of rage, it is annoyed, and it wants to go down.\n\n[14] The warden is the most concepted and worked through mob in Minecraft in terms of sound design.\n\n[15] When Brandon was first developing the warden, sound design was important to him, and the warden was designed with that in mind.\n\n[16] While designing the warden, Brandon wanted to hear the player's \"heartbeat\" as the warden got closer for anticipation but he thought that it felt out of place and didn't make sense to hear the player's heartbeat.\n\nHis solution was for something else to make the heartbeat, and thus the warden gained a heartbeat.\n\nIt was also a design choice to mimic some really interesting sound design without breaking immersion.\n\nIt also adds more to the warden itself and lore reasons as to why a warden has a heartbeat.\n\n[17] [18] Some previous names being considered for the warden were the shade, [19] the stalker and the hollowed.\n\n[20] The shade was a vaguely humanoid translucent mob with glowing eyes.\n\nIt was meant to be a more ambient mob, which would stand in darkness with only its eyes visible and would slowly fade away as the player approached it.\n\nIt would also imitate the noise of other mobs, making it sound as though they were right behind the player.\n\nRather than an iteration on the warden, by then called the \"stalker\", the shade had come to be a completely separate mob to the stalker, though in some concepts it was meant to be sort of complementary, living in the ancient cities and helping the stalker by tricking players into alerting it.\n\nIt was eventually scrapped due to a feeling that it would grow to become annoying rather than creepy, and so the team could better focus on developing the stalker.\n\n[21] The stalker iteration was tall and asymmetrical with a glowing core, sometimes referred to as a chest crystal.\n\n[22] It occurred in totems throughout the deep dark.\n\nThe stalker would stand completely still to trick players into taking its core and aggravating it, and could transform into a form one block high form to prevent players from escaping through small tunnels.\n\nThis iteration, specifically its appearance and transformation mechanic, felt clunky and was deemed more goofy than scary, so it was scrapped by the Mojang Studios gameplay developers.\n\nThe vibration-sensing aspect, which was developed in this version, however, was passed down to and refined in the later iterations.\n\n[23] [24] The hollowed was designed with the intent of inciting trypophobia and had white flesh with holes in it, and a rib cage-like mouth.\n\nAccording to Brandon Pearce, its design was an experiment to see how far the boundaries of Minecraft could be pushed and to try and draw a line as to what would be acceptable.\n\nThe design had to ultimately be toned down multiple times due to said metaphorical line being crossed and after many back-and-forths between the developers, the directors and art team, a design similar to the current one was landed on.\n\n[25] [26] The warden also had a number of other mechanics and abilities planned: If the player managed to get out of the warden's attack and pathfinding range but still be within its detection range, the warden would use a \"mind-altering\" attack that would cause the player to move erratically (walking forward would cause the player to go backwards, etc.) and deal damage overtime.\n\nThe mechanic was eventually scrapped due to being deemed too complicated.\n\n[27] [28] The warden would destroy blocks or burrow through them.\n\nThe former was rejected due to the developers wanting to limit the number of \"destructive\" mobs there are in the game and the latter was rejected due to being too difficult to implement.\n\n[28] The warden could hide the player's hunger bar and health bar.\n\n[29] Brandon Pearce wanted the warden to be immune to damage to discourage players from fighting it, but he didn't think that would work for a sandbox game.\n\n[30] The warden would originally burn when exposed to daylight.\n\n[31] In the Bedrock Beta/Preview 1.18.30.32 the warden would dig back down when exposed in daylight but it was changed so the warden doesn't dig back down but stays when exposed to daylight in Beta/Preview 1.19.0.20.\n\nThe warden and sculk were inspired by Lovecraftian horror as the developers wanted to make something that wasn't in the traditional scary like jumpscares and etc.\n\nbut in a mysterious and unknown scary.\n\n[32] In the fifth episode of Minecraft Now, it was revealed by Jasper Boerstra that the warden went through over 175 different concept iterations and they have explored everything because they wanted the warden to be something really special and also for it to be scary, beautiful, ugly, cute, and have some empathy.\n\n[33] In the sixth episode of The Secrets of Minecraft, it was jokingly revealed that the warden's personal names are \"Jonathan\" and \"William\", depending on the scene, similar to how the player, the ender dragon or the wither all have personal joke names.\n\n[20] \"Warden\" itself was also jokingly broken down into \"War!\n\nDens!\" in the description.\n\n\"Jonathan\" can be seen on a blackboard for name suggestions alongside \"the stalker\" and \"the hollowed\".\n\nIt jokingly explained that the name \"warden\" was the result of calling it \"William\" and spelling it wrong.\n\nIn the tenth episode, both names were used when Narrator spotted the warden behind him.\n\n[34] He mistakenly called the warden Jonathan before correcting himself as William, foreshadowing Jonathan Minecraft, who appears in the eleventh and final episode leading into Around the Minecraft World in 80 Biomes.\n\n[35] Brandon Pearce stated in a tweet that the souls in the warden's chest is important to its lore.\n\n[36] He also stated that the warden is inspired by the mystery heard at the end of the music disc \"11\".\n\n[37] Coincidentally, in the spin-off game, Minecraft: Story Mode, there is an unrelated character also named the warden.\n\nEven if the player wears a full set of Netherite armor and all four gears contain Protection IV resulting in a 64% damage reduction cap, the player will still more likely to die first as the Warden only needs to hit the aforementioned player exactly four times, assuming no potion effect is in play.\n\nAn interesting fact is that if you invert the colors of the axolotl, the color palette is like that of the warden.\n\nIt is unknown if this is intentional or a coincidence.\n\nIn the 15 Year Map, The Warden appears in the Caves and Cliffs which can be found in the Deep Dark.\n\nBut they were added in The Wild update not in the Caves and Cliffs.\n\nThe Secrets of Minecraft: How We're Making the Warden, Minecraft, January 21, 2022.\n\nA warden.\n\nA warden with all

article: Tutorials/Witch farming The witch may spawn in the Overworld above opaque blocks at a light level of 0, in all biomes except mushroom fields and deep dark.\n\nEvery swamp hut spawns a witch and a cat inside during world generation both which never despawn.\n\nOtherwise, witches spawn in the hut.\n\nIn Java Edition, only witches spawn in the 7\u00d77\u00d79 volume that is the hut, which is the size of the roof and one block over the porch, from one level below the floor of the hut to two blocks above the roof.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the hut has a hardcoded spawn spot on which witches spawn: the spawn spot is the same for every hut.\n\nSome witches always spawn as part of raids starting from wave 4 in Bedrock Edition or wave 3 or 4 in Java Edition depending on the world difficulty.\n\nA villager transforms into a witch when lightning strikes within four blocks.\n\nThe witch transformed from a villager does not despawn and cannot be changed back into a villager.\n\nThis witch attacks the player with its potions even if the player traded with it before.\n\nThe rooftop and scale of a swamp hut, as well as the spawning zone.\n\nThe spawn area matches the roof, plus the porch.\n\n(Java Edition) Shows the side of a swamp hut, also shows the scale of it and proper height.\n\n(Java Edition) Witches spawn on the northwest corner of the spawn spot, which is marked with a block of lapis lazuli in this picture.\n\n(Bedrock Edition) Witches are a source of potion ingredients and are the only mobs that are able to spawn in the small area around a swamp hut.\n\nThese huts are the best place to farm witches, but they require spawning platforms and light levels of 0.\n\nA hut can support a maximum of three spawning platforms.\n\nWitch huts generate in swamp biomes sometimes, but the witch-exclusiveness depends on the entire hut being inside a swamp biome.\n\nIn raids found in villages, it is more worthwhile to simply build an illager farm and deal with witches as they spawn.\n\nA witch drops 5 experience orbs when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nWitches have the largest loot table of any mob, making one to three drops of zero to two items each, for a maximum of six items total.\n\nA witch may drop Stick, Glass Bottle, Glowstone Dust, Redstone Dust, Spider Eye, Gunpowder or Sugar.\n\n[1] The likelihood of a witch to drop sticks is 25%, while the remaining items have a probability of 12.5%.\n\nThe odds of a witch dropping the maximum amount of items possible without a Looting enchantment are 1 in 81 (1.2%).\n\nEach level of Looting increases the maximum items dropped by one for each of the one to three drops, leading to a maximum of five items per drop and a maximum of fifteen items total.\n\nNo Looting averages two items per kill, Looting I averages three, Looting II averages four and Looting III averages five.\n\nA potion has a 8.5% chance of dropping if a witch is killed while drinking the potion increased by 1% for every level of Looting.\n\nA witch drops one of the following in this case: Potion of Healing Potion of Fire Resistance Potion of Swiftness Potion of Water Breathing A witch is neither an illager nor a villager.\n\nWitches do not use housing, the equipment in their swamp huts and cannot open doors.\n\nWitches are peaceful toward villagers and wandering traders when not participating in raids, although their potions can hit one by accident.\n\nIn Java Edition, witches are given the Glowing effect for 3 seconds when a bell is rung within 32 blocks of them.\n\nThis applies to all witches, regardless of whether they participate in raids or not.\n\nThe poison, instant damage, evoker fangs, warden's sonic boom, and the Thorns enchantment magical sources are 85% less effective against witches.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, witches are immune to poison, fatal poison and to their own thrown harming potions.\n\nThe particle effect that witches emit.\n\nWitches have a 1.5% chance every second to spawn 10 to 44 ornamental particles above their heads, named \u201cwitch\u201d in Java Edition or \u201cwitchspell\u201d in Bedrock Edition and purple in color.\n\nA witch pursues the player within 16 blocks and uses potions of the first level in combat, throwing splash potions offensively and drinking potions defensively.\n\nThese potions are the same as ones obtainable through brewing, with the same duration.\n\nA witch has an infinite stock of potions, even when transformed from a villager or not having had any potions equipped in their inventory.\n\nEach potion chosen by the witch depends on the circumstance and is thrown within ten blocks and in a three-second interval.\n\nThe witch throws a splash potion of Slowness if the player is eight, nine or ten blocks away and does not already have the Slowness effect.\n\nThis makes it harder for the player to escape if they attempt to.\n\nThe witch throws a splash potion of Poison if the player's health is at least 8 and is not already poisoned.\n\nThe witch has a 25% chance of throwing a splash potion of Weakness if the player is 3 or less blocks away and does not already have the Weakness effect.\n\nThis is used to weaken the player's melee attacks on the witch if they attempt to.\n\nThis Weakness effect can be used to cure zombie villagers.\n\nIf none of the above conditions are true, the witch defaults to using a splash potion of Harming, which does 6 magical damage.\n\nA witch may choose to equip and drink a potion each game tick (1 \u2044 20 second) if it is not already drinking a potion.\n\nDrinking the potion takes 1.6 seconds [2] and slows down its moving speed.\n\nIt does not attack during this time.\n\nWhen 80% under water and lacking Water Breathing, there is a 15% chance of drinking a potion of Water Breathing.\n\nWhen on fire or the last damage taken in the past 2 seconds was fire damage, there is a 15% chance of drinking a potion of Fire Resistance.\n\nWhen not at full health, there is a 5% chance of drinking a potion of Healing, which heals 4.\n\n[3] When the witch is eleven or more blocks from a target and does not have the Speed effect, there is a 50% chance of drinking a potion of Swiftness.\n\nAs a result, witches are difficult to kill via suffocation or cacti due to their frequent use of healing potions, cannot drown underwater and require a long time to die in lava or fire.\n\nIf the raid members kill all the villagers in a village, witches jump in commemoration to their victory.\n\nIn Java Edition, any witch can join a patrol if sufficiently near a patrol captain.\n\nThese witches are hostile towards villagers, wandering traders and iron golems if in their sight.\n\nWitches that participate in a raid seek out illagers and ravagers and throw splash potions of Regeneration of 45 seconds or Instant Health if they have 4 or less.\n\nWitches do not retaliate when attacked by evoker fangs, illagers, or harming potions from other witches.\n\nInstead, they drink a beneficial potion.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, witches participating in a raid do not heal other illagers [until BE 1.20.30 ], but still attack the player, iron golems and snow golems.\n\nWitches throw negative splash potions at any mob that attacks it, including other witches and illagers.\n\nJava Edition: Witches use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 Except for the second copy of ambient5, which is 0.72-1.08 Bedrock Edition: \u2191 a b 0.8-1.2 for all except the copy of ambient5, the first sound in the

maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe witch is based on Baba Yaga, a witch from Slavic folklore who also lives in a swamp hut.\n\n[13] When the subject of witches dropping sticks was brought up, Nathan Adams jokingly replied that it's because witches are made of wood.\n\n[14] He later explained [15] that it was a reference to this scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\n\nA witch fits through two block tall gaps, despite being taller than two blocks with its hat.\n\nWhen drinking a potion, a witch's nose lifts and points forward.\n\nA witch's nose slightly wiggles when idle.\n\nWitches have small mouths hidden under their noses.\n\nDuring their potion-drinking animation, this mouth becomes visible from the side.\n\nIn the Village and Pillage update

[Java Edition only ] When spawned, the wither grows larger in size as its health bar fills up.\n\nWhile in this state, the wither is invulnerable, and neither moves nor attacks.\n\nWhen this state ends (after 11 seconds), the wither creates a large explosion centered on itself, destroying nearby blocks and dealing up to 68 \u00d7 34 damage to nearby mobs and players, depending on difficulty.\n\nThis explosion has a blast power of 7, more than that of a charged creeper or an end crystal.\n\nIt is accompanied by a loud gruesome sound that can be heard equally from across the map and in all dimensions [JE only ].\n\n[1] After this, the wither attacks nearby mobs and can take damage.\n\nThe wither has the greatest natural health of all mobs in Minecraft (exceeded by the warden, while Bedrock Edition 's wither still has the highest health), at 300 \u00d7 150 in Java Edition or 600 \u00d7 300 in Bedrock Edition.\n\nThe wither is immune to fire, lava, drowning damage, and freezing.\n\nLike other undead mobs, the wither is harmed by the Instant Health effect and healed by the Instant Damage effect as well as affected by weapons with the Smite enchantment.\n\nIt is immune to all other status effects, like the ender dragon.\n\nUpon taking damage, the wither breaks all blocks within a 3\u00d74\u00d73 area around it, including blast-resistant blocks like obsidian, crying obsidian, and ancient debris, dropping them as items if possible.\n\nThe wither is the only mob in the game that can destroy obsidian.\n\nThe wither cannot break the following blocks: Barrier Bedrock End Portal End Portal Frame End Gateway Command Block Structure Block Jigsaw Block Light Block Moving Piston Moving Block  [Bedrock Edition only ] Reinforced Deepslate In Java Edition, these blocks are listed under the wither_immune tag.\n\nThe wither attacking a villager.\n\nThe wither's block-breaking behavior makes suffocation ineffective under most circumstances.\n\nHowever, the blocks listed above, as well as some natural structures that include them, can be used to suffocate the wither due to their wither immunity.\n\nThe wither is hostile toward all mobs except: Undead mobs Zombies and their variants Skeletons and their variants Zombified piglin s Skeleton horse s and zombie horse s Phantom Zoglin Other withers Ghast s [2] Mobs with the Invulnerable NBT tag.\n\nIf the wither is idle, it simply hovers and is unable to gain altitude.\n\nOn Normal or Hard difficulty, it fires blue skulls in random directions until it finds a target.\n\nThe wither's boss health bar color depends on the edition: Dark purple on Java Edition, or pink on Bedrock Edition.\n\nIt appears only when a player is looking in the wither's direction, including through walls.\n\nAll withers display a boss bar on the screen.\n\nRenamed withers display the changed name above its boss bar.\n\nThe sky darkens when the wither spawns (a kind of fog).\n\nWither with 'wither armor' effect, after half health depleted.\n\nUpon noticing a mob, the wither hovers above it and rapidly shoots black wither skulls.\n\nEach head fires independently, allowing a wither to attack up to three different mobs/ players at the same time.\n\nThe main head controls the wither's movement and has a 0.1% chance to shoot a blue wither skull instead of the default black one.\n\nWhenever a wither kills another mob, a wither rose is planted if the ground is grass block, dirt, coarse dirt, moss block, mud, netherrack, soul sand, or soul soil on Java Edition, or otherwise dropped as an item at that mob's location; however, it may be destroyed by other wither skulls.\n\nWither roses are planted/dropped even when the game rule doMobLoot is set to false.\n\n[3] The wither has a passive regeneration rate of 1 every 20 ticks (1 second), and a direct killing blow on a target instantly heals 5.\n\nWhen its health drops below half (150 \u00d7 75), the wither gains a natural \"wither armor\" effect, which makes it immune to damage from arrows and thrown tridents and causes it to fly at the same height as the target.\n\nThe armor disappears if it regenerates above half health.\n\nUpon noticing a player or mob, the wither flies to a random location and hovers in place.\n\nIt shoots 3 black wither skulls and one blue wither skull before flying to another location.\n\nThe time between each shot decreases as the wither loses health.\n\nOn Normal difficulty or higher, if the wither has targeted an entity but cannot find a location to pathfind to, it shoots random blue skulls in a random direction along with the skulls directed toward the target.\n\nWhen a wither reaches halfway of its total health, it causes a large explosion that spawns 3 wither skeletons (except on Easy difficulty), as well as gaining wither armor.\n\nInstead of flying to a random location, it dashes toward its target, destroying blocks and damaging mobs in its path.\n\nIt also fires up to 4 skulls per burst: three black skulls followed by one blue skull.\n\nIt has different spawn and death animations, both of which involve the wither exploding.\n\nWither roses always drop as an item when the wither kills a mob.\n\nWither roses are dropped even when the game rule doMobLoot is set to false.\n\n[4] The wither rose inflicts the Wither effect for a couple of seconds when stepped on.\n\nThe sky light level drops to 11 and dark clouds appear from the moment the wither spawns until it is dead, preventing zombies, skeletons, and drowned from burning in sunlight.\n\nOn Easy difficulty, the wither does not inflict the wither effect or summon wither skeletons.\n\nWithers will retain their anti-projectile armor after healing it over 1/2 of its total HP (301 \u00d7 150.5), though it disappears after the game is restarted.\n\n[5] Not to be confused with Wither Skeleton Skull.\n\nWither Skull Normal Dangerous Behavior Does not exist Details Size Height: 0.3125 Blocks Width: 0.3125 Blocks When attacking, the wither rapidly fires explosive projectiles called wither skulls, which look like its own heads, at its target.\n\nThere are two types of wither skulls: a fast-moving black one, and a slower blue one.\n\nBlack wither skulls explode with a blast power of 1, the same as a ghast 's fireball, and cannot break blocks with a blast resistance above 4.\n\nBlue wither skulls have the same explosion strength, but move slower and are more destructive to terrain.\n\nBlue wither skulls break all breakable blocks (including obsidian, ancient debris, and blocks of netherite), but cannot break unbreakable blocks like bedrock, end portal frames, and reinforced deepslate.\n\nIn Minecraft Education, blue wither skulls deal increased damage, but with the same explosion radius.\n\nIf either type of wither skull hits a player or mob, it does 8 damage on Normal difficulty.\n\nIt also inflicts Wither II for 10 seconds on Normal difficulty and 40 seconds on Hard, which turns the player's hearts black () and drains health, similarly to Poison.\n\nHowever, unlike Poison, it can kill the player.\n\nLike other status effects, the Wither effect can be cured by drinking milk.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition and Legacy Console Edition, the blue skull can be deflected by hitting it with an empty hand, weapon, tool, or throwable projectiles such as tridents, arrows, snowballs, and throwable potions.\n\nJava Edition: Withers use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nWither skulls use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 MC-212623 \u2191 Does not trigger at all if the gamerule globalSoundEvents is false \u2191 MC-177741 Bedrock Edition: \u2191 Is normally 1.0, but can be 0.75

Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Wither\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe painting depicting how to spawn a wither According to Jeb, the wither was inspired by Terraria, which has a summonable boss mechanic.\n\nThe name itself is inspired by a poison spell in another game made by Jeb called Whispers in Akarra.\n\n[10] There is a painting showing the soul sand and wither skeleton skull formation needed to spawn a wither.\n\nIf the wither is damaged by the Void, it frantically attempts to fire blue skulls.\n\nAbove half health, the wither always attempts to stay a few blocks above the mob it is targeting.\n\nThis means that attempting to build or climb up to hit the wither using a sword is essentially impossible.\n\nIf the wither is after a blaze and the blaze tries to fly up to it, the wither attempts to keep rising above the blaze, thus making both of them rise higher until they hit a ceiling or until the blaze despawns or dies.\n\nAlthough the wither is 3.5 blocks tall, 3 blocks wide, and 1 block thick, its hitbox is only 3.5 blocks tall, 1 block wide, and 1 block thick.\n\nThe true dimensions of the wither are: 2.844 blocks tall (varies), 3 blocks wide, and 1.719 blocks long (also varies).\n\nThe wither appears on the four sides of chiseled red sandstone.\n\nThe wither's smaller heads shoot targets slightly slower than the main head.\n\nThe interval for smaller heads is 2\u20133 seconds, while the main head's always 2.\n\nAn enemy called the wither storm appears in Minecraft: Story Mode.\n\nIt was created by replacing the center block of soul sand with a command block.\n\nDespite not having visible feet, withers are still capable of making footstep sounds.\n\n[11] In Java Edition 3D Shareware v1.34, withers drop red keys.\n\nAccording to Quinn Richter, Marketplace Partner Manager, the wither's name is \"Simmons?\", similar to the ender dragon's name being \"Jean?\".\n\n[12] A wither skull can be deflected by shooting an arrow at it. [Bedrock Edition only ] If a deflected wither skull hits the wither, the wither takes damage. [Bedrock Edition only ] A wither and an ender dragon can engage in combat, but neither one damages the other.\n\nDespite being immune to projectiles when it has \"wither armor\", it is still able to be hit by the warden 's sonic boom attack.\n\nThis is because the warden's sonic boom attack is not a projectile, but an instant damage attack.\n\nTherefore, the wither is unable to defend against it with the \"armor\".\n\nThe withering effect after being damaged by a wither skull.\n\nThe \"wither armor\" that blocks arrows.\n\nThe wither and its armor.\n\nA larger image to show how to summon the wither.\n\nThe wither prepares for explosion with the invulnerable status after summoned.\n\nThe pit created after the wither has charged.\n\nThe wither attacking horses.\n\nThe wither's texture.\n\nWither attacking a sheep.\n\nWither attacking a village.\n\nA wither summoning setup.\n\nImage from Dinnerbone of a wither being built horizontally.\n\nA player avoiding a wither by using the Invisibility effect.\n\nFirst image of a wither being built in Bedrock Edition.\n\nWither in promotional artwork for the Pretty Scary Update.\n\nWither Storm, a variant of Wither as it appears on Minecraft: Story Mode.\n\nWither pictured in the Mobestiary.\n\nLEGO Minecraft wither.\n\n\"Acid Wither,\" an official T-Shirt design.\n\n\"Jolly Mobs Flying Head,\" another T-Shirt design.\n\nEnder dragon, the other boss mob in Minecraft Tutorials/Defeating the wither, a tutorial explaining different tactics to fight and kill the wither \u2191 MC-177741 \u2014 Wither sounds play for all players \u2191 MC-162557 \u2014 \"Withers no longer attack ghasts\" \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 MC-154922 \u2191 MCPE-73842 \u2191 MCPE-161643 \u2013 After healing a wither boss over 1/2 HP, it still retains its anti-projectile shield \u2191 \"Minecraft 1.4 - How to Spawn Wither Mob - Mojang PAX 2012 Live @ 3:07\" \u2013 Accelerated Ideas on YouTube \u2191 http://www.twitch.tv/pax2/b/330745811 (at 3:57:47) \u2191 MC-29274 \u2191 MC-189872 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 https://minecraft.net/article/meet-wither \u2191 MC-92623 \u2191 \"Ask Mojang #4: To The Moon!\n\n@ 3:40\" \u2013 Minecraft on YouTube, November 8, 2019 Meet the Wither \u2013 Minecraft.net on February 13, 2017 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

[JE only ] The detection range of zombies is reduced to half of their normal range (17.5 blocks) when the player is wearing a zombie head.\n\nIf a zombie sees a player and a villager together, the zombie prefers to attack the player first.\n\nA zombie already hunting a villager continues to do so even if the player is near, until the player attacks it.\n\nZombies periodically make groaning sounds, which can be heard up to 16 blocks away.\n\nZombies attempt to avoid obstacles, including fall damage, fire, lava, magma blocks, and cactus and try to find the shortest path toward the player.\n\n[1] Unlike skeletons, zombies do not try to avoid being hit and continue to pursue the player even when being attacked.\n\nZombies attack baby turtles and actively seek out and destroy turtle eggs within 24 blocks horizontally and 3 blocks vertically, by jumping on them until they crack and break.\n\nZombies hunt and attack golem utility mobs within 42 blocks.\n\nIron golems and snow golems attack zombies without provocation, although snow golems deal only knockback to zombies with their snowballs.\n\nZombies target and hunt villagers within a 35\u2013 to 52.5\u2013block radius (depending on regional difficulty) [Java Edition only ] or a 16-block radius [Bedrock Edition only ] and they can always see villagers through walls.\n\nIf a zombie is attacking a villager and sees the player, it interrupts its attack on the villager to attack the player instead, even if the player has not attacked it [JE only ].\n\nOnce a zombie has targeted a villager, the zombie ignores any other villagers and the player, until its target is dead or the zombie is attacked [JE only ].\n\nAny zombie variant can transform a villager into a zombie villager.\n\nThe probability depends on the difficulty: 0% chance in Peaceful (no zombies spawn) and Easy 50% chance in Normal 100% chance in Hard Zombies target and hunt wandering traders within 35 blocks and can see traders through walls.\n\nThe zombie focuses solely on the trader unless it's attacked, or if either it or the target is killed or moved out of range, or if the trader is under the invisibility status effect.\n\nA zombie breaking down a wooden oak door.\n\nThe zombie can break only the top half of the door, not the bottom half.\n\nWhen the sun is 15 degrees or more above the ground, zombies burn once exposed to direct sunlight.\n\nBurning is suppressed when the zombie is: in a sufficiently shaded area: a sunlight level of 11 or less (a 1 block roof overhang provides sufficient protection even if it would have a sunlight level of 14); in water; wearing head armor (the helmet absorbs the damage from light but may take several day cycles to wear out completely).\n\nunder the status effect of Fire Resistance.\n\nstanding in cobwebs.\n\n[2] Transparent and translucent blocks, including glass and ice, do not prevent them from burning. [JE only ].\n\nIf they attack an entity while burning, they may set it on fire, with a (30\u00d7 regional difficulty)% chance and with a 2\u00d7floor (regional difficulty) second duration.\n\nIf wearing armor enchanted with Thorns while burning, they may set players attacking them on fire with thorns damage alone.\n\nZombies are undead mobs, harmed by the status effect Healing, healed by the

automatically picking up dropped items that they come across.\n\nMob heads and carved pumpkins are automatically worn on their heads.\n\nZombies can equip armor, weapons or tools.\n\nIf a zombie encounters another similar item, it may drop the previous item in favor of the new one, if: the new item is armor or a sword and the old item was not (for example, zombies prefer swords to pickaxes, and helmets to carved pumpkins), both items are armor/swords and the new item is better damage-wise (reduces higher damage for armor, or inflicts more damage for swords), both items are armor/swords with the same damage reduction/infliction, the new item has NBT tags while the old does not or the new item is more damaged than the old item, or both items are bows and the new item has NBT tags while the old does not.\n\nItems dropped by mobs in exchange for another cannot be picked up by players or mobs for 10 game ticks (0.5 seconds, barring lag), but can be picked up by hoppers.\n\nA zombie holding a picked-up item does not despawn when left alone, similar to being name tagged.\n\nZombies have a higher chance of being able to pick up items in Hard difficulty.\n\nPicked-up items do not cause the zombie to drop more experience when killed, unlike naturally-spawned gear.\n\nUp to 10% of zombies (depending on regional difficulty) in pursuit of a target bang on closed wooden doors and on Hard (and Hardcore) difficulty can succeed in breaking them down.\n\nOtherwise, the door cracks but does not break.\n\nA zombie choosing to break the door down instead of taking an alternative path.\n\nThe zombie also breaks down the door if the door is blocking its way.\n\nZombies can break only the top half of a door, meaning they cannot break a door if the zombie is facing the bottom half of the door.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Java Edition.\n\nOn all difficulty levels, damaged zombie mobs (including husks, drowned and even zombified piglins [3]) call all other zombies within a 67\u00d721\u00d767 to 111\u00d721\u00d7111 area [n 1] centered on the attacked zombie to target the attacker.\n\nIn Hard difficulty, zombies can spawn additional zombies to \"help\" when damaged.\n\nEach zombie has a \"likeliness to call reinforcements\" statistic ranging from 0\u201310%, and \"leader\" zombies (0\u20135% depending on regional difficulty) get a bonus of 50\u201375 percentage points to the stat.\n\nWhen the zombie is damaged by an entity or is damaged while targeting an entity, up to 50 attempts are made to randomly choose a spawn location (0 or \u00b17\u201340 blocks away in all three axes) that is above a block with a solid top surface, has light level 0, has no players within 7 blocks, and has no colliding entities or blocks at which to spawn the reinforcement.\n\nBoth the damaged zombie and the new zombie has a 5 percentage point penalty to their \"likeliness to call reinforcement\" stat, preventing infinite zombies from spawning this way.\n\nZombie reinforcements can spawn even in locations where naturally spawned zombies can't spawn, like mushroom fields, the End, and the Nether [4], although they still cannot spawn on blocks where other items like redstone dust or pressure plates are placed.\n\nThese effects can be negated by killing the zombie in as few hits as possible, by using environmental damage such as cactus or lava, or by avoiding them completely.\n\nThat is, if the zombified mob drops experience, it has a chance to spawn reinforcements.\n\nAdditionally, reinforcements do not spawn at all, even on Hard difficulty, if the game rule doMobSpawning is set to false.\n\nLeader zombies are a special type of zombie that spawn with an added 50-75% chance to spawn reinforcements.\n\nThe chance of a leader zombie spawning increases with clamped regional difficulty, up to a 5% chance of spawning.\n\nReinforcements zombies spawn regardless of the hostile mob cap.\n\nThey also spawn on the north-west corner of the designated block, instead of the center of the block like natural mob spawning does.\n\n[5] Zombies spawned as reinforcements cannot be zombie villagers, but they can be babies, including chicken jockeys.\n\nA husk that suffocates in water converts to a zombie.\n\nA zombie that suffocates in water converts into a drowned.\n\nIf a zombie's head is submerged in water for 30 seconds, it begins converting into a drowned.\n\nThe zombie shakes, similar to a zombie villager being cured and, after 15 seconds, the zombie becomes drowned.\n\nOnce this process starts, it cannot be stopped even if the zombie leaves water.\n\nThis time is not affected by the Respiration enchantment or the Water Breathing status effect.\n\nA newly-converted drowned always has full health even if converted from a damaged zombie.\n\nAn item being held or worn by a zombie when it becomes drowned, whether it was picked up or naturally spawned, has a 100% drop rate, which includes any naturally spawned equipment dropping with full durability [BE only ].\n\nOnly normal zombies can become drowned; zombie villagers and zombified piglins cannot be converted.\n\n[6] Husks, however, convert into zombies if they drown, and then this zombie converts into a drowned as does a normal zombie.\n\nAny husks that convert into zombies also have full health, even if the drowned husk is damaged.\n\nJava

normal zombie villager in Bedrock Edition  [until BE 1.20.30 ] and a cleric zombie villager in Java Edition  [upcoming: BE 1.20.30 ]).\n\nOne of them transforms into a leatherworker, due to the workstation (a cauldron).\n\nThey also generate as part of abandoned villages.\n\nZombie villagers generated in both of these structures do not despawn naturally.\n\nAll mobs that can be ridden by baby zombie villagers in Bedrock Edition.\n\nBaby zombie villagers make up 5% of zombie villager spawns.\n\nThey have big heads, unlike normal baby villagers.\n\nThey behave similarly to regular zombie villagers, with the following differences: They are 30% faster than normal zombies, yet they have the same health as normal zombies.\n\nThis makes baby zombie villagers more dangerous than their bigger counterparts.\n\nThe noises they make are higher-pitched than adult zombie villager sound effects.\n\nIn Java Edition, baby zombie villagers have a chance to spawn as a chicken jockey.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, 10% of naturally spawned baby zombie villagers can start riding a mob and become a jockey when it tries attacking a villager, player, or golem.\n\nThey can ride: Adult chickens Untamed ocelots Untamed cats Untamed wolves Adult zombies Adult husks Adult zombified villagers Adult zombified piglins Cows Adult unsaddled pigs Sheep Adult untamed horses Adult untamed donkeys Adult untamed mules Adult skeleton horses Adult zombie horses Mooshrooms Spiders that was not spawned as a jockey mount Cave spiders that was not spawned as a jockey mount Pandas Baby zombie villagers turn into baby villagers, if cured.\n\nIn Java Edition, their heads turn back to small baby villager heads.\n\nWorn armor shrinks to fit their body size.\n\nThey are able to fit through 1\u00d71 block gaps.\n\nThey drop 12 experience when killed by the player instead of 5.\n\nUnlike most other baby mobs in the game, they stay as babies indefinitely and never grow into \"adult\" zombie villagers.\n\nThey have a decreased hitbox size.\n\nBaby zombie villagers are spawned when a zombie kills a baby villager, the chance of infection being the same as adult zombie villagers.\n\nBaby zombie villagers also spawn naturally, but the combined chance (5% villagers \u00d7 5% babies) is low at 0.25% (or 1 in 400 chance) of all newly spawned zombies.\n\nAlong with skeletons and regular zombies, some zombie villagers are capable of picking up dropped items.\n\nThese zombie villagers automatically pick up and hold any item that they come across (except jack o'lanterns  [Java Edition only ], mob heads and pumpkins, as these are worn on their heads), and use any armor, weapons, or tools picked up.\n\nIf they encounter another similar item, they pick it up and drop their previous item: if the new item is armor or a sword and the old item was not (for example, zombie villagers prefer swords to pickaxes and helmets to pumpkins), if both items are armor/swords and the new item is better damage-wise (reduces more damage for armor, or inflicts more damage for swords), if both items are armor/swords with the same damage reduction/infliction, the new item has NBT tags while the old does not or the new item is more damaged than the old item, or if both items are bows and the new item has NBT tags while the old does not.\n\nItems dropped by mobs in exchange for another cannot be picked up by players or mobs for 10 game ticks (0.5 seconds, barring lag), but can be picked up by hoppers.\n\nArmor worn by zombie villagers is not damaged from most damage sources, which means it cannot \"wear out\" the way player armor does.\n\nHelmets (not blocks like pumpkins) on zombie villagers can wear away and break if the zombie villager is exposed to daylight, or has an anvil or other falling block dropped on its head.\n\nZombie villagers also have a natural armor rating of 2 (), which gives 1.6 - 8% damage reduction from most sources.\n\nSome zombie villagers that are capable of picking up items spawn already in possession of such items, and those items may also be enchanted.\n\nThe chances of that event are listed below.\n\nIf a zombie villager spawns wearing multiple pieces of armor, the armor is never mismatched (i.e.\n\nall pieces are made of the same material).\n\n\u2191 a b c d e f g h i Value is based on the regional difficulty.\n\n\u2191 a b Enchantment is the same as on an enchantment table at level 5\u201322.\n\n[note 1] \u2191 1 \u2044 3 chance of an iron sword, 2 \u2044 3 chance of an iron shovel If a zombie does spawn with armor, the chances of specific armor are as follows: The chances of it being of a particular material are: Any zombie villager that spawns with equipment (picked-up items don't count) drop 1\u20133 extra experience per item.\n\nIn Java Edition  [upcoming: BE 1.20.30 ], a zombie villager retains its biome and profession after conversion from a villager.\n\nThey also retain their trades.\n\nBelow is a table of the variant and what workstation it required before zombification.\n\nThe zombie villager cannot work at a job site block.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, zombie villagers do not display their professions, but they still have the same profession after curing as before zombification.\n\nThey use the texture of an unemployed villager from their corresponding biome.\n\nBelow is a table listing the various professions, along with the specific job site block that each profession requires: \u2191 In Bedrock Edition  [until BE 1.20.30 ], all naturally spawned zombie villagers use the unemployed textures.\n\nWhen they die, zombie villagers drop 0\u20132 rotten flesh.\n\nThe maximum drop is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-5 with Looting III.\n\nThey can also drop an iron ingot, carrot, or potato when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nThis drop has a 2.5% chance of occurring, increasing by 1% per level of looting.\n\nIndividual items have the following chances of dropping: 1 \u2044 120 (about 0.83%) 7 \u2044 600 (about 1.17%) with Looting I 9 \u2044 600 (1.50%) with Looting II 11 \u2044 600 (about 1.83%) with Looting III Any picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping on death or when cured and drops with the same damage level it had when picked up.\n\nCarved Pumpkin [note 1] Jack o'Lantern  [Java Edition only ] [note 1] Iron Shovel Iron Sword Random Armor Zombie villagers have an 8.5% chance of dropping their naturally-spawned equipment (other than Halloween pumpkins), and drop it with a random durability.\n\nEach level of Looting increases the chance 1 percentage point (11.5% with Looting III).\n\n\u2191 a b Zombie villagers spawn with pumpkins and jack o'lanterns  [Java Edition only ] only during Halloween.\n\nAdult zombie villagers drop 5 and an additional 1\u20133 per naturally-spawned equipment.\n\nBaby zombie villagers drop 12 experience.\n\nMain article: Zombie \u00a7 Behavior Zombie villagers behave as ordinary zombies, except that they do not convert to drowned when submerged.\n\nIn Java Edition, zombie villagers that were converted from villagers retain their professions and clothes, which gain a tattered appearance.\n\nNaturally spawned zombie villagers (or ones spawned with spawn eggs) have a random profession that is not retained upon being cured; instead, they become unemployed and may gain a new profession if a job site block is nearby.\n\nZombie villagers can also spawn with the unemployed or Nitwit outfits.\n\nZombified nitwits remain nitwits after being cured.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, all zombie villagers have the same appearance, which looks like an unemployed zombie villager.\n\nNaturally spawned zombie villagers (or ones spawned with spawn eggs) have a random profession that is retained upon being cured.\n\nHowever, the profession is not locked and the cured villager may gain a new profession if in a village with an available job site block.\n\nZombie villagers can be unemployed, but they cannot be nitwits (zombified nitwit villagers become unemployed zombie villagers).\n\nBaby zombie villagers are always unemployed.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Curing a zombie villager Zombie villagers can be cured (converted to normal villagers) by first giving them the Weakness effect, which can be applied by: A splash potion of Weakness thrown by the player, a dispenser, or a witch.\n\nAn area effect cloud of Weakness from a creeper explosion [Java Edition only ], or a lingering potion.\n\nAn arrow of Weakness.\n\nThe / effect command, if cheats are enabled.\n\nThe weakened zombie villager must then be healed by using a (non-enchanted) golden apple on them.\n\nThe zombie villager begins to shudder to signal that curing is in progress.\n\nAlso, the Weakness effect is removed, replaced by Strength for the duration of the curing process.\n\nAn internal countdown timer is then started, counting down the total time to cure.\n\nTime to cure is initially 2000 ticks (nominally, 100 seconds or 1m 40s) in Bedrock Edition or a random integer between 3600 and 6000 ticks (180 to 300 seconds, 3\u20145 minutes) in Java Edition.\n\nOn each tick, there is a 1% chance for the game to look for cure accelerants.\n\nIt checks each block within a 9\u00d79\u00d79 cube centered on the villager for either an iron bar or a bed (either half: they're detected separately).\n\nFor each one found up to 14, there is a 30% chance of decreasing the countdown timer by 1 more tick.\n\nTherefore, having at least 14 half-beds and/or iron bars within range speeds up conversion by an average of 4.2%.\n\n[1] During the curing process the zombie villager behaves like a normal zombie except that it gains Strength (with a potency that doesn't depend on the difficulty level).\n\nThus, a zombie villager is more dangerous during curing than at other times.\n\nAt the end of the curing process, the zombie villager transforms into a villager and gains the Nausea effect for 10 seconds (which has no effect on the villager's behavior).\n\nIf it was holding any item it picked up, that item is dropped (unless it was enchanted with Curse of Binding, in which case it remains in the villager's inventory but is not worn and will not be dropped if the villager is killed).\n\nIf it was a baby before it was transformed into a zombie villager, it remains a baby after the cure.\n\nIf it had traded with a player at least once, it recovers its former profession and inventory of trades.\n\nOtherwise, it recovers its profession but might immediately change it if it finds and claims a workstation block for a different profession.\n\nA newly-cured villager, if it had a profession prior to being zombified, offers a trading discount to the player who administered the cure.\n\nThese discounts are permanent.\n\nIf a villager is cured more than once, the discounts get deeper until the price reaches the minimum of one emerald.\n\nVillagers near the cured villager are also affected but offer fewer, smaller discounts.\n\nZombie villagers that are in the process of converting do not despawn if the player moves far away from them, but like all monsters, they despawn if the difficulty is changed to Peaceful.\n\nIf a zombie villager spawned as a nitwit or was a nitwit before it was transformed into a zombie villager, it remains a nitwit if cured.\n\nCuring a villager spreads minor_positive gossip through the villager gossip system.\n\nA former nitwit zombie villager becomes an unemployed villager and can learn a profession after the cure.\n\nVillagers who were unemployed before transforming into a zombie villager might immediately claim a workstation to gain a profession.\n\nVillagers in a range of 16 blocks in a cube surrounding the cured villager also offer a small discount proportional to the number of cured villagers (up to 10).\n\nSaving and reloading the world causes the curing process to finish as soon as the chunk containing the villager is ticked.\n\nThis does not happen if the player moves out of range, then returns: In that case, the countdown timer pauses until the player returns.\n\nJava Edition: Zombie villagers use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b MC-226770 \u2191 MC-218122 Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock

entity in Java Edition.\n\nAn evoker attacking with its fangs.\n\nEvokers attack players, adult villagers, iron golems, snow golems  [BE only ] and wandering traders within 12 blocks by rising and waving both of their arms while looking at their target and summoning magical fangs or vexes, creating different colored particles for the different attacks.\n\nIf the player is within a 10 block radius and the evoker is not in the middle of summoning an attack, the evoker flees from the player to avoid being attacked.\n\nAn evoker summoning fangs in two circles around it.\n\nEvokers are passive in Peaceful difficulty  [BE only ].\n\nThey will still attack any adult villagers, iron golems, wandering traders, or snow golems in the Peaceful difficulty.\n\nIf an evoker is attacked, all nearby [needs testing ] evokers become alerted and start attacking the player, even if they are behind walls.\n\nIn Java Edition, the alerted evokers can attack the player from an infinite distance away, even if the player switches to Creative or Spectator mode [1]; this can be fixed by relogging the world, or by setting the game rule universalAnger to True [needs testing ].\n\nIn Java Edition, an evoker is passive to other illagers even if it is harmed.\n\nAny evoker can search for and join a patrol if sufficiently near a patrol captain.\n\nIn Java Edition, evokers and illusioners are faster without any effects during raids.\n\nIn Java Edition, evokers are given 3 seconds of the Glowing effect if a bell is rung within 32 blocks of them.\n\nThis applies to both evokers spawned in raids and evokers spawned in woodland mansions.\n\nEvokers flee from creakings when within 8 blocks of them.\n\nThe evoker signals this attack by producing purple particles () and a low-pitched sound.\n\nA number of fangs rise out of the ground around the player, then snap shut and vanish.\n\nPlayers or mobs caught in the attack are dealt 6 damage, regardless of difficulty.\n\nThis harm is not mitigated by armor but is mitigated by enchantments such as Protection.\n\nAny evoker-summoned fangs do not deal damage to any illagers (witches are not illagers, so can be damaged and will retaliate [other than in a raid, in which case the witch will drink a beneficial potion and ignore [needs testing ] ]), although fangs summoned or spawned by the player do.\n\nFangs appear no lower than the feet of the lowest combatant and no higher than one block above the feet of the highest combatant.\n\nFangs attempt to appear on the highest opaque block between those two extremes, but fail to spawn if they are obstructed by a solid block.\n\nIn practice, this means that fangs cannot spawn inside deep pits or on top of high walls, but may, for example, go up a staircase if the target is at the top and the evoker at the bottom, or vice versa.\n\nLikewise, an evoker floating in a boat on water cannot summon fangs against a player swimming or floating in a boat because there are no opaque blocks from which the fangs can appear.\n\nThe evoker typically summons 16 fangs in a straight line toward the target.\n\nHowever, if the target is within 3 blocks of the evoker, the evoker summons the fangs in two circles around itself: the smaller circle has 5 fangs and the larger has 8.\n\nThe fangs do not seek the player, thus the player is able to dodge them.\n\nSummoning fangs resets the evoker's spell cooldown to two seconds and resets the cooldown for summoning fangs to five seconds.\n\nIf a neutral or hostile mob is caught in an evoker's fang attack, the mob attacks the evoker.\n\nThe evoker signals this attack by producing white particles () for two seconds and a higher-pitched sound.\n\nThree vexes appear nearby.\n\nThe evoker can summon vexes as long as there are fewer than eight vexes within 16 blocks centered on the evoker.\n\nThis spell resets the evoker's spell cooldown to five seconds and resets the cooldown for summoning vexes to 17 seconds.\n\nAn evoker summoning vexes.\n\nIn Java Edition, evokers may summon two circle fangs while summoning vexes, without any cooldown.\n\nIt usually happens when a player melee attacks an evoker while it is summoning vexes.\n\nThe Minecraft Dungeons' evoker also feature this combo attack behavior.\n\nAn evoker using its sheep color conversion spell.\n\nWhile the evoker is not engaged in combat and / gamerule

particles () and making a \" wololo \" sound.\n\nThis spell resets the evoker's spell cooldown to three seconds and resets the cooldown for the sheep color conversion spell to seven seconds.\n\nEvokers look at the sheep they are using the spell on while they are doing the spell until they finish the spell.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, evokers can still change a sheep's color when /

    "content": "For the powerful mob in Minecraft Dungeons, see MCD:Illusioner.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Java Edition.\n\nIllusioner Illusioner Casting Aiming Health 32 \u00d7 16 Classification Illager hostile mob Behavior Hostile Damage Easy and normal: 2 \u2013 5 Hard: 3 \u2013 5 The illusioner is an unused illager armed with a bow.\n\nIt attacks using illusions and can also fire arrows.\n\nAn illusioner has no spawn egg in the Creative mode inventory.\n\nAn illusioner can be spawned only using data packs or the / summon illusioner in-game command.\n\nIllusioners do not spawn in woodland mansions or pillager outposts, nor at raids or patrols.\n\nSimilarly to the other unused giant and zombie horse mobs, illusioners do not spawn in any biome, monster spawner or world -generated structure.\n\nWhen an illusioner is killed by a player or a tamed wolf, any naturally spawned equipment, including its unenchanted bow, has an 8.5% chance of dropping (or 9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) and drops with a random item durability.\n\nIn addition, 5 experience orbs are dropped on player or tamed wolf kills.\n\nAn invisible illusioner captain and its four copies strafing.\n\nThe real banner is invisible.\n\nThe illusioner also drops one illager ominous banner if it is a raid captain.\n\nAlthough they do not naturally spawn in raids, illusioners spawned by the player attack players, adult villagers, iron golems and wandering traders within a 16*4*16 cubic area.\n\nAn illusioner joins a nearby raid if it occurs or joins a patrol if sufficiently near a patrol captain.\n\nThe illusioner attacks with its spells and its bow, firing an arrow every second.\n\nUnless the illusioner is summoned using commands, it cannot attack with a non-bow item in its hand, cannot use tipped arrows in its offhand slot (but can use spectral arrows) and cannot use enchanted bows.\n\nAlso, it is the only illager that can see its target through walls.\n\nThe Illusioner moves quickly on a semi-circular fashion and always tries to maintain a consistent distance between itself and the player, strafing from left to right and vice-versa, retreating if the player gets too close or advancing if the player retreats.\n\nFinally, the illusioner has two spells: a spell that blinds its opponent and a spell that summons visual pseudo-duplicates and makes the illusioner invisible.\n\nThe illusioner casts its blindness spell only if the regional difficulty is greater than 2.\n\nAs result, the world difficulty setting, the inhabited time of a chunk, the total daytime in the world and the phase of the moon from the day-night cycle affects its ability.\n\nAn illusioner's four false duplicates.\n\nThe real illusioner is invisible.\n\nAn illusioner casts a Blindness effect that lasts for 20 seconds upon first engaging a new player opponent.\n\nIt signals this attack by raising its arms during a short-timed animation, making a low pitched sound and producing a black mist of particles ().\n\nOther entities (typically a wolf, a snow golem or an iron golem) do not trigger this magic.\n\nThe illusioner does not cast this spell more than once on the same player opponent, unless it has first shifted its attention to another opponent and then back to that original opponent.\n\nThis spell resets the illusioner's spell cooldown to 1 second and resets the cooldown for the blinding spell to 9 seconds.\n\nAs long as an illusioner is engaged in combat, it casts an Invisibility status effect on itself that lasts 60 seconds and refreshes the effect whenever the Invisibility's time runs out.\n\nThe illusioner signals this spell by raising its arms, making a strange high pitched sound and producing a blue mist of particles called \"mirror\" ().\n\nWhen an illusioner becomes invisible through this or another method, it creates four false duplicates of itself.\n\nThese hover and waver at short distances from the actually invisible illusioner, though they do not space themselves out until the first time the illusioner is attacked.\n\nThey face in exactly the same direction as the illusioner and move somewhat in step with the original, appearing to no-clip through blocks like a vex does.\n\nDespite using the shooting animation whenever the original uses its bow, only the real illusioner can shoot and be damaged.\n\nThe clones move to new positions if they were not triggered and are still bunched together.\n\nThe Illusioner can also do this once in a while to \"refresh\" the clones' positions.\n\nWhen the real illusioner is damaged, its duplicates all snap back to where the real illusioner is, then quickly snap back out to new positions, making a teleporting sound, signaling the hit.\n\nIf an invisible illusioner receives the Glowing effect, all of the duplicates glow, while the true illusioner remains invisible.\n\nMoreover, only the invisible illusioner burns when catching fire.\n\nThe duplicates dissipate once the illusioner's Invisibility effect ends.\n\nThis spell resets the illusioner's spell cooldown to 1 second and resets the cooldown for the invisibility spell to 17 seconds.\n\nIllusioners use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b c MC-98316 See also: Entity format Illusioners have entity data associated with them

illusioner Issues relating to \"Illusioner\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe illusioner displace sound is almost the same as the traditional teleport sound displaced by teleportation via an ender pearl or chorus fruit, endermen or shulkers, albeit with a slight distortion at the end.\n\nIllusioners shoot backward when they are in a boat.\n\n[2] Illusioners hold bows in a different direction compared to skeletons or players, a little more diagonally.\n\nThe illusioner's second death sound is the same as the evoker's second death sound.\n\nIn a video titled ' Easter Eggs behind the...\n\nSick villagers???\n\n' that was recently posted on the official Minecraft YouTube channel, not only do they mention the Illusioner, but Jens also says 'You will definitely be seeing more of them in the future', which indicates that the Illusioner may be officially be implemented into the game in the near future.\n\n[3] Illusioner illusions duplicates dying when the

Raid captain Pillager Pillager Aiming Pillager (BE) Aiming (BE) Health 24 \u00d7 12 Classification Illager Behavior Hostile Passive (only if its crossbow is broken) Spawn Patrols Pillager outposts Raids Damage Ranged Easy: 3.5 \u00d7 1.75 Normal: 4 Hard: 4.5 \u00d7 2.25 Melee  [BE only ] Easy: 2 Normal: 3 Hard: 5 Details Size In Java Edition: Height: 1.95 Blocks Width: 0.6 Blocks In Bedrock Edition: Height: 1.9 Blocks Width: 0.6 Blocks Pillagers are hostile mobs armed with crossbows found in wandering patrols, in pillager outposts, or as participants in raids.\n\nThey attack by firing arrows at the player.\n\nIn Java Edition, a pillager spawned by a player using a spawn egg or commands can be a captain which has an ominous banner sticking out of its head.\n\nIn Java Edition, the number of pillagers spawning in each patrol varies from one to five and depends on the regional difficulty, with one spawning as a patrol captain.\n\nPatrols occur after 5 1 \u2044 2 in-game days, any time and independently of structures, which means they still spawn in worlds without generated structures.\n\nA patrol spawns 24 to 48 blocks away from a random player, on the highest solid block.\n\nThe individual pillagers of a patrol can spawn only at block light level less than 9, regardless of sky light.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, each patrol spawns two to five pillagers.\n\nOne of these pillagers is a patrol captain.\n\nAfter 5 1 \u2044 2 in-game days, patrols appear 24 to 48 blocks away from the player, at a light level of 7 and below on Easy or any light level on Normal and Hard difficulty.\n\nPillagers continually spawn in a 72\u00d754\u00d772 block volume centered on the top floor in a pillager outpost.\n\nSome pillagers spawn as outpost captains.\n\nThey may spawn on any valid opaque block if the block light level is less than or equal to 8.\n\nIn Java Edition, there can be unlimited pillagers that spawn in outposts naturally, limited only by the natural spawning rules.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, pillagers continually spawn at or below a particular location in the outpost, choosing the highest opaque block with a non-solid block on top and spawning on the northwest corner.\n\nA maximum of eight pillagers spawn naturally in an outpost.\n\nIn a raid, pillagers are more common in the earlier waves and decrease in number as the waves progress.\n\nDespite this, they still constitute the majority of raiders in total.\n\nOne pillager spawns riding a ravager in the fifth wave.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, one of the ravagers is ridden by a pillager instead of a vindicator on the seventh wave.\n\nIn Java Edition, pillagers spawn during bonus waves and have the largest chance of being the raid captain in the first wave, but in the second wave and onwards, vindicators have a greater chance than pillagers of being the raid captain.\n\nA pillager drops upon death: In Bedrock Edition, pillagers drop 0 - 2 arrow s.\n\nEach level of the Looting enchantment increases the maximum number of arrows dropped for up to five.\n\nThere is a 8.5% chance to drop a crossbow when killed by the player or a tamed wolf.\n\nThe crossbow may be loaded or unloaded depending on the crossbow's state when the pillager dies.\n\nThe drop chance increases by 1% per level of Looting.\n\nThe crossbow is of a random durability and has a chance of being enchanted.\n\nThe chance ranges from 0% to 10% depending on the regional difficulty.\n\nThe enchantment level is from 5 to 19.\n\n5 experience points and an additional 1\u20133 points per naturally-spawned equipment when killed by the player or a tamed wolf.\n\nIts illager ominous banner if spawned as a captain.\n\n1 Ominous Bottle which gives Bad Omen I-V if spawned as a captain.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, pillagers that were spawned by raids have a 6% chance on easy and normal or 80% chance on hard difficulties to drop these: 0\u20131 Emerald (10 \u2044 39 or 25.6%) 2\u20133 Emerald (5 \u2044 39 or 12.8%)

50% chance to be enchanted at level 5 to 19.\n\nSaid equipment may also have enchantment combinations that cannot be normally obtained, such as Blast Protection and Fire Protection on the same pair of boots.\n\nIron equipment drops are always of 30 to 90% item durability.\n\nThese drops are affected by the Looting enchantment.\n\nEnchanted books have level 30 enchantments, which can also be treasure enchantments.\n\nSpecial loot chances of dropping Easy and normal modes Hard mode An emerald: 8.32% 10.24% 2-3 emeralds: 8.32% 10.24% 4-5 emeralds: 3.33% 4.102% An enchanted book: 3.33% 4.102% An iron equipment: 4.16% 5.12% Pillagers are hostile toward players, iron golems, wandering traders and adult villagers.\n\nPillagers also aid other pillagers attacked by other mobs.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a pillager that accidentally harms a vindicator or evoker causes it to retaliate and attack the pillager.\n\nIn Java Edition, pillagers do not retaliate on vindicators or evokers that attack them.\n\nA passive pillager holding an ominous banner in the right hand.\n\nWhen a player is in Creative mode or applied with the Invisibility effect, getting near a pillager still causes it to take notice and stare at the player.\n\nIf a pillager notices an enemy while staring at the player, the pillager stops staring and attacks the enemy.\n\nIf a player with the invisibility effect attacks a pillager, the pillager still retaliates.\n\nA pillager attacks by shooting arrows from its crossbows every three seconds from up to eight blocks away and pursues enemies for up to 64 blocks in Java Edition or 16 blocks in Bedrock Edition.\n\nPillagers move slowly when wandering or loading crossbows in Java Edition.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, pillagers move from one place to another as fast as when they're provoked, although they stop and look around, pointing their crossbows along.\n\nPillagers point their crossbows at any player or mob they are looking at, whether their crossbows are loaded or unloaded.\n\nA pillager stares at the player and points its crossbow toward the player when the player is in creative mode or when the player has the invisibility status effect.\n\nThe patrol captain wears an ominous banner, known as the illager banner in Bedrock and Education Editions, on its head.\n\nThe other illagers follow the captain around.\n\nThe pillagers that are part of a patrol do not attack immediately.\n\nThe patrol members' heads turn to follow the player or mob who attracted their attention.\n\nIf the player or villager-like mob attacks or approaches within ten blocks of the patrol members, then this provokes them into loading their crossbows and attacking.\n\n[1] If raiding pillagers kill all the villagers in a village, they celebrate their victory by jumping and laughing.\n\nUnarmed pillagers also cheer.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, pillagers wave their arms while holding their crossbows in their main hand when cheering.\n\nPillagers can take and equip illager banners within 3 blocks, but non-raider pillagers do not search for ominous banners.\n\nIn Java Edition, if a pillager gets attacked by a mob (excluding illagers and goats) or player, it will alert other pillagers to target the attacker unless the pillager was killed in one hit.\n\nPillagers can also use crossbows in their off-hand.\n\nWhen a pillager finds a target, the pillager chases the target, then locks the target in its attack range and loads its crossbow.\n\nPillagers with their crossbows loaded can attack at any blocks away if the target is out of their attack range.\n\nPillagers, unlike evokers or vindicators, attack on sight, not regarding distance, although attacking a pillager, vindicator or evoker far away causes the attacked illager and the same type of illagers around the attacked illager to attack the player regardless of distance.\n\nThe command /summon pillager ~ ~ ~ {} summons a passive pillager that does not attack.\n\nA pillager's crossbow eventually breaks with repeated use, unlike weapons wielded by other mobs.\n\n[2] Unarmed pillagers are passive toward the player, iron golems and villagers, but they still frighten villagers and iron golems are still hostile toward them.\n\nThis also includes pillagers that don't have a crossbow, which means any pillagers with a sword or any weapon other than a crossbow are still passive.\n\nAn unarmed pillager always faces any player in its field of view or any mob that attacks it.\n\nA pillager spawned with arrows or firework rockets in its off-hand slot will use them, depleting the stack over time and switching to regular arrows once running out of ammo.\n\n[3] When firing firework rockets, pillagers will aim above the target as when using arrows, despite rockets being unaffected by gravity.\n\n[4] If a pillager's arrow hits a neutral or hostile mob by accident, the mob attacks the pillager.\n\nPillagers cannot use their crossbows in their off-hand, as mobs cannot use weapons in their off-hand, just like players.\n\nThe different of the pillagers texture in Java (left) and Bedrock (right) Edition.\n\nPillagers use an outdated behavior.\n\n[5] [6] They also have different arm textures.\n\n[7] Pillagers load their crossbows upon spawning or if their crossbows are unloaded.\n\nWhen a pillager finds a target, it loads its crossbow first, chases the target and attacks upon in range.\n\nPillagers are not hostile to players before their crossbows are loaded, so sometimes they don't look at players or run around while loading their crossbows.\n\nA dispenser can equip a pillager with armor.\n\nHowever, an armor item isn't rendered on pillagers.\n\nIf a player summons a pillager without a crossbow by spawn event command, it still shoots arrows to attack targets, like other arrow-shooting ranged mobs.\n\nThis is due to the fact that in the pillager.json and ranged piglin.json files, the component_groups have both minecraft:behavior.ranged_attack and minecraft:behavior.charge_held_item, so if a pillager does not have a crossbow, the charge_held_item behavior cannot trigger and it continuously shoots arrows due to the ranged_attack behavior.\n\nUnlike in Java Edition, the crossbows of pillagers in Bedrock Edition don't break.\n\n[8] Pillagers use a melee attack while underwater, unlike pillagers in Java Edition that maintain using crossbows underwater, although the shot arrows travel slower underwater and sink after a short distance.\n\nA player receives the Bad Omen status effect by drinking an Ominous Potion.\n\nThe effect lasts for 100 minutes (five in-game days) and can be removed by drinking milk.\n\nWhen a player afflicted with Bad Omen enters a village, a raid commences in that village, bringing about waves of illagers that seek and try to kill all villagers.\n\nEach patrol spawns one pillager captain.\n\nWhile outposts can continually spawn pillager captains, each captain inflicts the player who killed it with one level of Bad Omen upon death.\n\nRaid captains do not inflict Bad Omen when defeated in a raid.\n\nIn Java Edition, killing multiple captains in succession raises the Bad Omen level to a maximum of V, increasing the chance of pillagers and vindicators in the resulting raid wielding enchanted weapons.\n\nAs long as the Bad Omen level is higher than I, the resulting raid includes an additional wave with a raider composition identical to that of the last wave.\n\nJava Edition: Pillagers use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: \u2191 Due to a typo, the third sound for pillager celebrating is unused.\n\nSee MCPE-121058.\n\nJava Edition: Bedrock Edition: Pillagers have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Tags common to all mobs spawnable in raids Inventory: Each compound tag in this list is an item in the pillager's inventory, up to a maximum of 5 slots.\n\nItems in two or more slots that can be stacked together are automatically be condensed into one slot.\n\nPillagers don't change their inventory automatically or drop items from it upon death.\n\nThe inventory is currently unused.\n\n[more information needed ] An item in the inventory, excluding the Slot tag.\n\nTags common to all items Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nThis section would benefit from the addition of more images.\n\nPlease remove this notice once you've added suitable images to the article.\n\nThe specific instructions are: Pillagers before Bedrock Edition Beta 1.9.0.2.\n\nRenders of unarmed pillagers before and after 20w29a (MC-158735) Issues relating to \"Pillager\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nAlongside crossbows, pillagers were taken from Minecraft Dungeons, even though they were added to the base game first.\n\n[9] Pillagers were added in Village & Pillage as a means to give villagers a \"true\" adversary in order to balance the new village mechanics.\n\n[10] An original design of the pillager appeared like a pirate wearing an orange vest.\n\nHowever, Mojang Studios' mob designers changed the mob's design to look more like brigandine armor.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a running pillager uses the player's running animation rather than that of other illagers.\n\nSummoning an unarmed pillager in Java Edition that is invulnerable (/summon pillager ~ ~ ~ {Invulnerable:1b}) does not cause villagers to run away from the pillager.\n\nTyping /summon pillager ~ ~ ~ minecraft:calm in Bedrock Edition cause the summoned pillager to not attack players.\n\nA pillager has a 1 \u2044 16,000 chance of dropping a crossbow enchanted with two Piercing I enchantments, a 1 \u2044 409,000 chance of dropping one with Piercing I and Multishot and a 1 \u2044 3,500,000 chance of dropping one with Piercing I, Multishot, Unbreaking III and Quick Charge I.\n\nThese probabilities were calculated with pillagers spawned from patrols or outposts, because pillagers spawned from higher levels of raids have an increased chance of dropping enchanted crossbows.\n\nAlso with maximum regional difficulty, as this affects the chance of a dropped crossbow being enchanted.\n\nA pillager armed with a crossbow, shown at

blocks In Bedrock Edition: Adult: Height: 1.9 blocks Width: 0.6 blocks Baby: Height: 0.95 blocks Width: 0.3 blocks Villagers are passive mobs that inhabit villages, work at their professions, breed, and interact with each other.\n\nAdult villagers' outfits vary according to their occupation and biome.\n\nA player can trade with them using emeralds as currency.\n\nThey are also the most complex mob in the game, expressing a vast array of behaviors.\n\nVillagers can be found in every type of village, which can spawn in several biomes such as plains, snowy plains, savannas, deserts, taigas, and snowy taigas  [Bedrock Edition only ] and can cut into other biomes such as swamps and jungles.\n\nWhen the village is generated, unemployed villagers spawn in them, the number of which depends on the buildings in that village, as some buildings generate villagers inside and some do not.\n\nA cleric villager and cleric zombie villager spawn locked up in the basements of igloos (if the basement generates) under the carpet of the floor.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the villager and zombie villager inside igloo basements have random professions instead of always being clerics.\n\nThe cleric villager can also turn into a leatherworker villager since the cauldron in the basement is closer to the villager.\n\nSee also: Zombie Villager \u00a7 Curing Giving a zombie villager the Weakness effect and then feeding it a golden apple starts the curing process.\n\nAfter five minutes, it transforms into a villager, displaying purple Nausea status effect particles for 10 seconds after being cured.\n\nThe villager retains the profession it had as a zombie, if it had one before turning into a zombie villager.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, if the zombie villager is player spawned, it adopts a randomly chosen profession.\n\nThe villager can also be a nitwit, as the game counts it as a \"profession\" but the nitwit villager still can't work.\n\nIf employed, the cured villager offers discounts on most of its trades.\n\nA villager, either adult or baby, does not ordinarily drop any items or experience when killed.\n\nHowever, when a player holds an emerald or other item a villager is willing to trade for, the item it offers in trade appears in its hands, alternating between items if there are multiple items the villager wants to trade.\n\nUpon successful trading, a villager drops 3\u20136.\n\nUpon successful trading, while willing to breed, 8\u201311 is dropped.\n\nNitwit and unemployed villagers leave their homes at day and begin to explore the village.\n\nGenerally, they wander inside the village during the day.\n\nThey may go indoors or outdoors, periodically making mumbling sounds.\n\nOccasionally, two villagers may stop and turn to look at each other, in a behavior called socializing, during which they stare at another villager for 4\u20135 seconds at a time.\n\nThey continuously stare at a nearby player unless the villager is trying to get into a house at night, farm food, work, or flee from a zombie or illager.\n\nBaby villagers may jump on beds and play tag with each other, similarly to how baby piglins and baby hoglins play tag.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, baby villagers do not stop continuously in front of players, though they still do stare as they move.\n\nVillagers tend to not travel far from their beds in a large village unless the job site or the nearest gossip site (bell) is far from their beds.\n\nVillagers, like other mobs, can find paths around obstructions, avoid walking off cliffs of heights greater than 3 blocks, and avoid some blocks that cause harm.\n\nHowever, in crowded situations, one villager can push another off a cliff or into harm's way.\n\nVillagers emit green particles if they join a village, set a bed, or acquire a job site/profession.\n\nVillagers run inside at night or during rain, closing doors behind them.\n\nThey attempt to sleep at night, but if they cannot claim a bed, they stay indoors near a bed until morning.\n\nIn the morning, they head outside and resume normal behavior.\n\nHowever, some villagers, such as nitwits, stay outside later than others unless being chased by an illager or zombie.\n\nIf a villager finds itself outside the village boundary, or a villager without a village detects a village boundary within 32 blocks, it moves quickly back within the boundary.\n\nA villager taken more than 32 blocks away from its village boundary forgets the village within about 6 seconds.\n\nWhether in a village or not, a villager is never prone to despawning.\n\nVillagers can open all wooden doors and find paths or blocks of interest behind the doors.\n\nHowever, they cannot open any trapdoors, fence gates, or iron doors.\n\nVillagers can climb ladders, but do not recognize them as paths and do not deliberately use them.\n\nAny climbing of ladders seems to be a side effect of them being pushed into the block by another mob, (likely, and most often, other villagers).\n\nUnfortunately, this behavior can leave them stranded on the second floors and roofs of some village structures, as they lack the necessary AI to intentionally descend ladders.\n\n[verify ] A simple fix for these situations is for the player to manually push the villager back toward the ladder hole and then install a wooden trapdoor at the top, after the villager is returned to the ground level.\n\nOne way to prevent a villager from climbing ladders is to break the first ladder touching the ground thus requiring a player to jump to the ladder to climb.\n\nVillagers flee from zombies, zombie villagers, husks, drowned, zombified piglins  [Bedrock Edition only ], zoglins, vindicators, pillagers (even if their crossbow has been broken), ravagers, and vexes within 8 blocks, and evokers and illusioners within 12 blocks in Java Edition /16 blocks in Bedrock Edition.\n\nLike other passive mobs, villagers sprint away when attacked.\n\nVillagers do not run away from skeletons (and their variants), spiders, or cave spiders since these hostile mobs are passive towards villagers, although a skeleton arrow might hit a villager by accident.\n\nVillagers favor pathways to reach a selected destination and try to stay in low-cost blocks, like the dirt path or cobblestone blocks.\n\nThey also avoid jumping.\n\nFor a list of job site blocks and the professions they are required for, see \u00a7 Professions.\n\nUnemployed villagers (other than babies and nitwits) seek employment at job site blocks (also referred to as workstations), and employed villagers use job site blocks to refresh their trades (see \u00a7 Working).\n\nVillagers who have made their first trade can only claim a site block that corresponds with their profession, whereas tradeless villagers may change their profession to match a site block.\n\nIn Java Edition, unemployed villagers claim job site blocks by searching for the nearest unclaimed site in a 48-block sphere.\n\nWhen a suitable site block is detected, the villager starts pathfinding to it, staking a provisional claim.\n\nThis can only occur while the villager is awake.\n\nA provisional claim is released if the villager cannot reach the block within 60 seconds, however the villager may try again immediately.\n\n[1] To fully claim the site and change profession, the villager must approach within a 2-block radius of the job site's center.\n\nWhen a job site block is fully claimed, its owner emits green particles, and no other villager can claim the block unless the owner relinquishes it.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, all villagers search for unclaimed job sites in a 16 block radius and 4 block height.\n\nIf a site block is found, it is added to a shared list of valid job site blocks for the whole village.\n\nAn unemployed villager with a bed claims the first site block on that list and immediately change profession to match, regardless of distance or accessibility to the site block.\n\n[2] A villager may make a claim while sleeping.\n\nIf a villager cannot pathfind to their claimed site, both the block and the villager emit anger particles; the job site block may need to be broken before the villager relinquishes it.\n\n[verify ] When a job site block is claimed, both the block and the villager making the claim emit green particles and the site block is removed from the list.\n\nA desert villager and a plains villager gossiping.\n\nVillagers can store certain memories about players in the form of gossip.\n\nThese get spread to other villagers whenever they talk with each other.\n\nEach piece of gossip is one of five types, and it stores a value as well as a target.\n\nGossips generate and increase in value as a result of various player actions.\n\nThe target is the player who caused the gossip.\n\nTogether the gossip values determine a player's reputation with the villager, which influence trading prices and the hostility of naturally spawned iron golems.\n\nTrading with or curing a villager increase the value of the corresponding gossips for the targeted villager only.\n\nWhen a villager is attacked or killed, however, it instead generates the major negative gossip in every other villager it could see (eye-to-eye line of sight) inside a box extending 16 blocks from the villager in all coordinate directions.\n\nWhen a piece of gossip is shared, it is received at a lower value than the sharer has it.\n\nGossips also decay a certain amount (see Decay column) every 20 minutes.\n\nSince major positive gossip have a share penalty equal to its max value and a decay of 0, it cannot be shared and never decays.\n\nA player's total reputation with a villager is determined by multiplying each gossip's value by their respective multiplier and adding the results together.\n\nFor example, if a player has recently cured a villager for the first time but also attacked the villager twice, their reputation with that villager would be 5 \u00d7 20 + 25 - 50 = 75.\n\nAfter 40 minutes the gossips have decayed twice, making the player's reputation 5 \u00d7 20 + 23 - 10 = 113.\n\nThe prices of a villager's trades all get reduced by reputation times the price multiplier rounded down, meaning that a positive reputation lowers prices but a negative reputation increase them.\n\nThe price multiplier is either 0.05 or 0.2 depending on the item, see trading.\n\nPrices can not get lower than 1 or higher than the item's stack size.\n\nThe exact function to calculate the price affected by the gossips is y = x - floor((5a + b + c - d - 5e) \u00d7 p), Where y is the final price, x is the base price, a is the value of major_positive, b is the value of minor_positive, c is the value of trading, d is the value of minor_negative, e is the value of major_negative, and p is the value of PriceMultiplier.\n\nIron golems that were not built by a player become hostile towards players whose reputation with any nearby villager is -100 or lower.\n\nThe golem checks all villagers inside a box centered on the golem and extending 10 blocks in every horizontal direction and 8 blocks in both vertical directions.\n\nPlayers can set villagers on fire using flint and steel or lava without affecting gossips.\n\nThe same is true for TNT activated by redstone or a dispenser.\n\nHowever, TNT ignited directly by a player (using flint and steel, fire charges or flaming arrows) does generate gossip for damaged or killed villagers, because the TNT's damage is attributed to the player.\n\nVillagers have eight hidden inventory slots, which start empty whenever the villager is spawned.\n\nVillagers do not intentionally seek out items to pick up, but they do collect any bread, carrots, potatoes, wheat, wheat seeds, beetroot, beetroot seeds, torchflower seeds, pitcher pods, and bone meal within range (bone meal can be picked up only by farmer villagers).\n\nThese are the only items they can pick up, although the player may use the / item replace command to put a random item into a villager's inventory.\n\nVillagers can fill all 8 inventory slots with the same item.\n\nIf a player and a villager are in the pickup range of an item at the same time, the player always picks it up first.\n\nIf several villagers are next to an item, the same one picks up the item every time.\n\nConsequently, in constrained space, the same villager picks up any item dropped.\n\nThis behavior prevents villagers from sharing food in a one-block space.\n\nWhen killed or converted to a zombie villager, any inventory item of the villager is lost, even when / gamerule keepInventory is set to true.\n\nIf / gamerule mobGriefing is false, villagers cannot pick up items, and farmer villagers cannot plant or harvest crops.\n\nLike other mobs, villagers have four slots for worn armor, separate from their inventory.\n\nAn adjacent dispenser can equip armor, elytra, mob heads, or carved pumpkins to a villager, but the armor is not rendered (except for carved pumpkins and mob heads).\n\nThe equipment functions as normal; for example, a villager wearing an armor piece enchanted with Thorns can inflict Thorns damage to attackers, and a villager wearing Frost Walker boots is able to create frosted ice.\n\nIf a villager is converted into a zombie villager, the armor it was wearing is dropped, though it may be able to pick it up and equip it again.\n\nVillagers sharing carrots.\n\nIn Java Edition, villagers collect bread, carrots, potatoes, beetroots, wheat seeds, beetroot seeds, and wheat.\n\nIf a villager has at least 24 of these items, it gives the extra amount to a villager with 4 or less of each these food items.\n\nThat other villager can also do this until all villagers have shared all items they could (for example, on a group of three villagers one receives 60 bread, then it shares 36 to another villager to keep 24 [3], and that same villager then shares 12 to the third villager).\n\nIn the case of wheat, villagers have a rather distinct behavior.\n\nThey do the same as other crops, but if a villager has at least 32 wheat, it tries to give half of it to another villager, making both have 16 wheat.\n\nIf a villager has 8 full stacks of any kind of food or seeds and then tries to share with another, for example a bait villager in a farm where a hopper picks it all up, it leaves 24 in each stack in its inventory instead of calculating the total amount it has, and it always tries to maintain this minimum amount, thus it can never really empty its inventory down to 0 and clear a slot to pick up other stuff, unless it uses the items when trying to breed or when farming if they are a farmer.\n\n[4] [5] In Bedrock Edition, if a villager has enough food in one inventory stack (6 bread or 24 carrots, potatoes, beetroots, or 18 wheat for farmers only) and sees a villager without enough food in one inventory stack (3 bread, 12 carrots, 12 potatoes, or 12 beetroots for non-farmers; 15 bread, 60 carrots, potatoes, or beetroot, or 45 wheat for farmers), the villager may decide to share food with that villager.\n\nTo share, a villager finds its first inventory stack with at least 4 bread, carrots, potatoes, or beetroot or with at least 6 wheat, and then throws half the stack (rounded down) in the direction of the target villager.\n\nWhen wheat is shared, it is first crafted to bread, which may result in 1 or 2 less than half the stack being shared.\n\nVillager farming.\n\nIn Java Edition, during the \"work\" portion of their schedule farmers tend nearby crops.\n\nFarmers sometimes move to random farmland blocks they detect within \u00b14 on the X and Z axes and \u00b12 on the Y axis, rather than going to their jobsite.\n\nIf there are fully-grown crop blocks or air above farmland within \u00b11 of the villager on each axis, the farmer spends 10 seconds tending them (not counting time spend walking to the next block), one per second.\n\nThe block is harvested if necessary and (re-)planted if the farmer has any seeds.\n\nIf / gamerule mobGriefing is false, villagers cannot farm.\n\nHarvesting is done regardless of the villager's current inventory, even if they lack space to pick up the results.\n\nPlanting is done as from the first eligible inventory slot.\n\nIf there is at least one non-fully-grown crop block within \u00b11 of the farmer on each axis, the farmer has bone meal, and it has been at least 8 seconds since the farmer last did some fertilization, then the farmer fertilizes up to four crop blocks (one every two seconds).\n\nWhen the farmer works at their composter, it composts excess wheat and beetroot seeds, and extracts bone meal if it is full.\n\nUp to 20 seeds are composted in one work session, but at least 10 of each type of seed are first kept.\n\nInventory slots are checked in reverse order.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, farmers tend crops within the village boundary.\n\nVillagers far enough outside the boundary of any village also tend nearby crops.\n\nFarmland to be tended is found by seeking for certain blocks up to 9 blocks away from the villager in the X and Z coordinates and up to 1 away in the Y coordinate (a 19\u00d719\u00d73 volume total).\n\nIf a farmer villager does not have enough food in one stack in its inventory (15 bread, 60 carrots, 60 potatoes, 60 beetroots, or 45 wheat) and finds fully-grown wheat, carrots, potatoes, or beetroot, the villager moves to the crop block and harvests it.\n\nIf a farmer villager has any seeds, carrots, potatoes, or beetroot seeds in his inventory and finds an air block above farmland, the villager moves to it and plants a crop.\n\nThey always plant from the first eligible slot in their inventory.\n\nFarmer villagers use and pick up bone meal.\n\nThey also fill their composter with seeds.\n\nFarmer villagers only start farming if a crop is planted on farmland previously.\n\nFarmer villagers continue to plant on the farmland even if all crops are destroyed.\n\nFor both editions, Farmer villagers cannot turn dirt, grass blocks, or dirt paths into farmland.\n\nNor they pick up any hoes to till the blocks.\n\nIf a hoe is placed into a farmer villager's mainhand or offhand via commands, they still cannot till any blocks.\n\nFarmer villagers often share their crops and food with other villagers if they have any extras.\n\nFor tutorials on breeding mechanics, see Tutorials/Village mechanics \u00a7 Breeding and population cap and Tutorials/Legacy Console village mechanics.\n\nIn Java Edition, villagers can only attempt to breed while wandering (see \u00a7 Schedules below).\n\nNote however, villagers may not always follow their schedule; they may for example start \u00a7 Panicking instead of wandering if frightened, or wander instead of \u00a7 Gathering if there is no meeting place set in the village.\n\nNote however during the night villagers will always search for their beds rather than wandering, thus they cannot breed during the night.\n\nIn Java Edition, wandering villagers may try to breed although there is no guarantee they will as villagers have multiple tasks to choose from while wandering.\n\nDuring a breeding attempt two willing (see \u00a7 Willingness below) villagers will look at each other and heart particles will appear around each of them.\n\nAn attempt succeeds if an unclaimed bed can be reached via pathfinding within a 48 block radius of the breeding villagers.\n\nIf successful, a baby villager will be created, 12 \u00a7 Food Units from each of the breeding villager's inventories will be consumed, and they must wait a 6000 tick / 5 minute cooldown before attempting to breed again.\n\nThe appearance of the child is randomly determined by either the biome type of the parents or by the biome where the breeding occurred.\n\nWhen the attempt fails anger particles are displayed, no baby villager is produced, and there is no cooldown before breeding may be attempted again.\n\nHowever, 12 food units are still consumed by each villager.\n\nSince villagers can't breed during the night they may produce up to two children a day maximum.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition a census is periodically taken to determine the current population of the village.\n\nAll villagers within the horizontal boundary of the village are counted as part of the population to determine if continued villager mating is allowed.\n\nHowever, any villager within the horizontal boundary of the village and the spherical boundary of the village attempts to enter mating mode as long as there is at least one villager within the boundary.\n\nIf two villagers simultaneously enter mating mode while they are close to one another, they breed and produce a child.\n\nThe appearance is determined by the biome where the breeding occurs in Bedrock Edition.\n\n[6] Two villagers breeding.\n\nDuring breeding, food is required and consumed from the villager's inventories.\n\nDifferent foods supply different amounts of \"food units\" to the villager.\n\nCarrots, potatoes, and beetroots count for 1 food unit each while bread counts as 4.\n\nVillagers must be willing to breed.\n\nIf a villager has 12 units of food in their inventory, they become willing.\n\nBreeding consumes the villager's food stock, therefore, after mating, villagers may cease to be willing until they regather a sufficient stock of food items.\n\nAny villager with an excess of food (usually farmers) throws food to other villagers, allowing them to pick it up and obtain enough food to become willing.\n\nThe player can also throw bread, carrots, beetroots, or potatoes at the villagers themselves to encourage breeding.\n\nVillagers consume the required food upon becoming willing.\n\nIf / gamerule mobGriefing is false, villagers don't pick up food or break crops.\n\nBreeding depends on the number of valid beds.\n\nIf a villager is \"willing\" (see \u00a7 Willingness above), villagers may breed as long as there are unclaimed beds available within the limits of the village.\n\n\u00a7 Baby villagers require beds with at least 2 empty blocks above the head (note that mobs view slabs as full blocks for pathfinding, so putting upper half slabs above a bed invalidates the bed).\n\nJob sites, jobs, doors, windows, or roofs are not required for villagers to breed.\n\nAll baby villagers are initially unemployed.\n\nSome baby villagers in Java Edition.\n\nTheir heads are smaller than Bedrock Edition or Minecraft Education baby villagers.\n\nBaby villagers sprint around, entering and leaving houses at will.\n\nThey sometimes stop sprinting to stare at other villagers, [Java Edition only ] the player, or an iron golem.\n\nIf the iron golem is holding out a poppy, the children may cautiously take the flower from its hands.\n\nBaby villagers tend to group and chase one another around the village as if playing tag.\n\nThey also jump on beds.\n\nIllagers ignore baby villagers until they reach adulthood.\n\nAn iron golem holding a poppy to a villager child.\n\nBaby villagers give gifts of poppies or wheat seeds to players who have the Hero of the Village effect in Java Edition.\n\nBaby villagers in Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education have a slightly bigger head than in Java Edition; this also can be seen in other baby mobs in the game as well.\n\nJava Edition baby villagers don't have too big of a head, so they look like a tiny normal villager.\n\nBaby villagers can fit through 1\u00d71 block gaps.\n\nA baby villager becomes an adult 20 minutes after birth, even when in a boat or a minecart.\n\nBaby villagers with no AI do not grow up.\n\nA villager gets struck by lightning.\n\nWhen lightning strikes within 3\u20134 blocks of a villager, the villager is replaced by a witch that can't despawn.\n\nEven a baby villager that is struck by lightning is turned into a two-block-tall witch.\n\nIron golems also attack any villagers that turned into witches.\n\nMain article: Iron Golem \u00a7 Villages Villagers can summon iron golems to protect themselves from hostile mobs.\n\nVillagers can summon an iron golem regardless of their profession (including nitwits) or latest working time.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a golem can spawn if there are at least 20 beds and 10 villagers.\n\nAll villagers in the village must have a bed, and a profession with access to the profession block.\n\nIt spawns in a 16\u00d76\u00d716 area around the village center and attempts to spawn once every 700 game ticks, or about every 35 seconds.\n\nOne golem spawns per 10 villagers.\n\nThe golem must be killed near the village as villagers have a long cooldown time for golems that wander away.\n\nA villager panicking.\n\nVillagers sometimes panic during a raid or a zombie siege by emitting water particles and shaking.\n\nDuring this time, Villagers refuse to sleep until the raid is over.\n\nIn Java Edition, villagers panic if they see a mob that is hostile toward villagers, like a zombie, zombie villager, husk, drowned, zoglin, illager, vex, wither, or ravager and flee frantically from them, sometimes hiding in houses.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, villagers panic by running around in circles around a bed in a village house, such as when a raid happens or when the player rings the village bell.\n\nJava Edition villagers in panic are more likely to summon iron golems.\n\nTo see these mobs, the villager must have an unobstructed line of sight to it (eye-level to eye-level), and be within a certain range (spherical distance between feet center bottom-most point of the villager and hostile mob): Main articles: Siege and Zombie Zombies, zombie villagers, husks, and drowned seek out and attack villagers within a 35\u2013 to 52.5\u2013block radius (depending on regional difficulty) [Java Edition only ] or a 16-block radius [Bedrock Edition only ] (even when the villager is invisible).\n\nZombies attempt to break down doors, but only a fraction of zombies can do so and can succeed only when difficulty is set to hard.\n\nZombies who cannot break doors tend to crowd around a door that separates them from a villager.\n\nIf a zombie or a drowned comes across a set of doors with one open, it usually tries to go through the closed door.\n\nBoth zombies and drowned either kill villagers or convert them to zombie villagers.\n\nThe chance of the villager becoming a zombie villager upon death is 0% on Easy, 50% on Normal, and 100% on Hard.\n\nBaby villagers can be infected by zombies as well.\n\nDrowned are able to convert villagers to zombie villagers, even when attacking with a trident from a distance.\n\nMain article: Raid During a raid, villagers flee from illagers and run to the nearest house, similar to a zombie siege.\n\nFor a villager to hide, the house must have a door and at least one bed.\n\nBefore the first raid wave in Java Edition, at least one villager rushes to ring the bell in the center of the village (if they are close enough) to warn the other villagers of an incoming raid before going into their house.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the bell rings automatically regardless of whether a villager is nearby.\n\nIn Java Edition, when a bell is rung, all illagers within 48 blocks get the glowing effect for 3 seconds.\n\nA villager often stays in the house it first entered, but may exit the house occasionally.\n\nThe player can still trade with villagers during a raid.\n\nOn random occasions, the villager displays water particles as if sweating.\n\nIn Java Edition, once the player gains the Hero of the Village status after defeating a raid, villagers give them a discount for their trades and throw them gifts related to their profession.\n\nFor a list of items that they can gift, see Hero of the Village \u00a7 Gifts.\n\nA lot of villagers staring at the player.\n\nVillagers stare at any player that stares at them, or goes near them.\n\nThis also applies for some mobs, especially wolves.\n\nA villager first turns its head towards the player, then the body.\n\nVillagers can keep staring at the player unless a raid happens or a zombie comes and chases them off.\n\nA villager staring at the player.\n\nVillagers have set schedules depending on their age and employment status.\n\nSchedules define the villager's goals, which mostly determine how they behave throughout the day.\n\nHowever, their goals can be interrupted by higher priority behaviors most villagers have, such as fleeing from an attack, trading, and getting out of the rain.\n\nEmployed villagers spend most of their day standing next to their job site blocks.\n\nFrom time to time, they \"gather supplies\" by wandering a short distance away, then returning.\n\nSome professions have additional job-specific goals that are part of their work schedule: Farmers harvest and sow crops.\n\nLibrarians inspect bookshelves. [Bedrock Edition only ] When a villager reaches its job site block, it commences \"work\".\n\nTwo times a day, this action of working resupplies any locked trades.\n\nVillagers can resupply twice per day, even without having a bed or while sitting in a minecart.\n\nA villager can \"reach\" its job site block if the block is in any of the 8 directly adjacent or diagonal block spaces horizontally around it at the height of their feet, or at the 9 blocks below that.\n\nVillagers can still \"reach\" them diagonally, even if they can't see or touch the face of the block.\n\nEmployed villagers do not breed with each other during their work schedule.\n\nNitwits and the unemployed do not follow this rule as they would breed with each other and the employed villagers.\n\nLeatherworker villagers work at any cauldron; the cauldron does not have to be filled with water in order for the villager to work at it.\n\nAll villagers wander from time to time, but for the unemployed and nitwits, they wander for the majority of their day.\n\nA wandering villager chooses a random block and walks toward it, then stands there for a variable amount of time before wandering again.\n\nIf at any time it detects a job site block it can claim, it does so, assumes the skin for the associated profession, and immediately begins following the appropriate schedule.\n\nA villager attempts to claim a job site block by finding a path to a block next to one, showing angry particles when unable to reach it.\n\nAfter a villager fails to reach the job site block several times, it becomes unclaimed, indicated by showing angry particles on it.\n\nThe villager loses its job site block and eventually becomes unemployed if the villager is at novice-level and no nearby job site block is available.\n\nAny other nearby unemployed villager has a chance to become the block's new owner.\n\nIf there are no unemployed villagers nearby, then the villager who lost the job site block seeks for another unclaimed one or tries to reclaim the same unreachable one in an endless loop (this also happens for claiming beds).\n\nThe wander schedule includes a job-specific goal called \"exploring the outskirts\" that causes villagers to wander near the edges of the village.\n\nThis enables them to detect new beds, job site blocks, bells, and houses that players have used to extend the village.\n\nDuring this time of the day, they may also share items.\n\nIn Java Edition this is the only time of day villagers are able to breed.\n\nAs there are multiple tasks villagers may choose to do, there is no guarantee they will breed.\n\nLate in the day, adult villagers gather at a meeting place (the area around a bell).\n\nWhen two villagers encounter one another, they mingle (look at each other and \"converse\" by humming at other villagers).\n\nIf a villager isn't close enough to detect a bell, it wanders randomly, searching for one.\n\n5 villager children chasing one another.\n\nBaby villagers wander randomly around the village.\n\nWhen they encounter another baby villager, the two of them follow each other for a while and sometimes run as if racing or chasing each other.\n\nIn Java Edition, they sometimes stop to jump and bounce on a bed or to stare at an iron golem they encounter.\n\nIf the iron golem offers them a poppy, the baby villager cautiously accepts it.\n\nAll villagers head home a short time before sunset.\n\nThey roam around until they get near their beds, then target a block beside the bed.\n\nOnce they reach their beds, they do not go through a door again before sleeping.\n\nA villager who has no bed simply waits inside a house until morning.\n\nThis includes players stealing a villager's bed to sleep in, mostly the villager stays in the house and doesn't move until sunrise.\n\nBut sometimes, if they detect a unclaimed bed nearby they walk out of the house and towards the bed.\n\nA villager pushed on a bed in Java Edition.\n\nThe villager falls off the bed if it is pushed again.\n\nDropping an anvil on a villager that is sleeping in Java Edition does not hurt the villager nor causes the villager to wake up.\n\nA villager sleeping in a bed at night (from the top view).\n\nAt sunset, villagers lie down in their beds and remain there until morning.\n\nVillagers wake early if food is thrown at them  [Java Edition only ], they are pushed out of bed, or if their bed is destroyed.\n\nThey also wake up when their bed is used, if they are attacked, or when a bell is rung.\n\nIf possible, they return to sleeping in a bed after the interruption.\n\n# Jumping on a bed with a villager sleeping in it doesn't cause the villager to get up.\n\nIn Java Edition, villagers can be pushed on beds and sometimes turn their heads.\n\nA villager can be pushed off a bed, [7] but most likely to go back to sleeping after staring at the player who pushed the villager for a few seconds.\n\nWhen sleeping in Bedrock Edition, a villager's hitbox reduces to a cube restricted to the pillow part of the bed.\n\nIf an anvil is dropped on the hitbox, the villager takes damage and wakes up.\n\nIn Java Edition, dropping any anvil on a villager that is sleeping causes the anvil to bounce and drop as an item, and the villager remains sleeping and does not take damage.\n\nA villager who has no bed continues wandering in search of a bed to claim.\n\nVillagers follow their Overworld schedules regardless of which dimension they are in.\n\nThey can sleep in the Nether or the End, without causing the usual consequences of the bed exploding (See Bed), if the Overworld's time is correct.\n\n[8] This is because the daylight cycle continues in these dimensions, even though it is not normally apparent to the player.\n\nSometimes when a villager gets in a bed from another direction they turn their body until their head is on the pillow of the bed.\n\nVillagers also sleep with their eyes open, just like players.\n\nVillagers get a brief regeneration effect once leveling up in their profession.\n\nPink regeneration particles appear when the villager is healing.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, when villagers successfully sleep, they immediately heal themselves when waking up at dawn if they are damaged.\n\nJob site blocks next to each other.\n\nAll plains biome variant professions (except unemployed) corresponding to their different job site blocks.\n\nEach villager can have a profession except for the nitwit, indicated by their clothing as well as by the title at the top of the trading interface.\n\nA villager can choose their profession by claiming a job site block.\n\nWhen they go to work, they use their daily schedule to get to their claimed job site block.\n\nSome professions, like farmers and librarians, do other things.\n\nFarmers plant crops, and librarians can inspect bookshelves.\n\nIf an adult villager does not have a profession (either they are unemployed or a nitwit), they wander instead.\n\nA job site block can be claimed only if it is unclaimed and within a village boundary with at least 1 bed.\n\nRemoval of a claimed job site block causes the owner to switch to another profession or become unemployed, provided that the villager has no prior trades with the player.\n\nIf the villager has prior trades, it keeps its profession and claims a new job site block that matches its profession if one is available.\n\nSo, once a player trades with a villager, the villager keeps its profession forever.\n\nNitwits and baby villagers cannot change their profession.\n\nIn Java Edition, villagers summoned by a spawn egg or via command / summon are always unemployed until they have claimed a job site block.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, however, villagers summoned in similar ways have a random profession [9]; their profession can be changed by a job site block, though.\n\nNovice-level villagers who have not yet traded can lose their profession and change into unemployed villagers.\n\nUnemployed adults actively seek for an unclaimed job site block and change into the corresponding profession.\n\nBelow is a table listing the various professions, along with the specific job site block that each profession requires: A nitwit bobbling its head Nitwit villagers wear robes that are green on top.\n\nThey cannot acquire a profession, trade, or gather around bells, but are still able to breed.\n\nThey are not equipped with a level stone since they cannot trade.\n\nPressing use on a nitwit in Java Edition causes it to grunt and bobble its head at the player.\n\nA nitwit must be born or spawned; no villagers change to nitwit from unemployed or a profession, and vice versa.\n\nNitwits can be found naturally or by curing naturally spawned zombie villagers.\n\nZombie villagers can also be spawned as babies, so this is the only way to encounter baby nitwits in survival mode.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, every baby villager has a 10% chance to become a nitwit when they become an adult, as well as having a different sleep schedule where they wander around the village for about 2000 ticks after other villagers go to sleep, before seeking a bed.\n\nIf they can claim a bed, they arise in the morning 2000 ticks (1 minute 40 seconds) after the rest of the village wakes up.\n\nVillagers and zombie villagers have seven skin types corresponding to the biome they spawn in.\n\nTheir appearance also varies based on their profession and their five tiers.\n\nThey show which trade tier they have unlocked by a badge of a varying material on their belt.\n\nA new tier is obtained every time a player trades with a villager and the badge appears as stone, iron, gold, emerald, and finally diamond.\n\nVillagers have different outfits depending on their biome.\n\nNaturally generated villagers take on the outfit from the biome they were spawned in.\n\nWhen breeding occurs, the outfit of the child is determined by the biome where the breeding occurs, but in Java Edition, there is a 50% chance it's inherited from the biome type of the parents (equal chance for both parents).\n\nIn case the villager's outfit is determined by biome but the biome has no specific villager type, it always becomes a plains villager.\n\nThe outfits available are: Variants Biomes \u3164\u3164 Variants Biomes Desert Badlands Eroded Badlands Wooded Badlands Desert [n 1] Plains River Beach Stony Shore Stony Peaks Birch

in Bedrock Edition.\n\nVillagers have 13 professions and 2 non professions for a total of 15 outfits: Farmer (straw hat) Trades crops and natural foods, such as bread and cookies.\n\nFisherman (fisher hat) Trades campfires and fishing items.\n\nShepherd (brown hat with white apron) Trades shears, wool, dyes, paintings, and beds.\n\nFletcher (hat with feather and quiver on the back) Trades bows, crossbows, all types of arrows (except luck), and archery ingredients.\n\nCleric (purple apron and creeper cloak) Trades magic items like ender pearls, redstone dust, glowstone dust, and other enchanting or potion ingredients.\n\nWeaponsmith (eyepatch and black apron) Trades minerals, bells, and enchanted melee weapons.\n\nThe axe enchantments are weapon related, such as sharpness or smite.\n\nArmorer (welding mask) Trades foundry items and sells chain, iron, and enchanted diamond armor tiers.\n\nToolsmith (black apron) Trades minerals, bells, and harvest tools.\n\nThe axe enchantments are tool related.\n\nLibrarian (eyeglasses and a book as a hat) Trades enchanted books, clocks, compasses, name tags, glass, ink sacs, lanterns, and book and quills.\n\nCartographer (golden monocle) Trades banners, compasses, banner patterns, papers, and various maps, including explorer maps.\n\nLeatherworker (brown apron and brown gloves) Trades scutes, rabbit hide, and leather-related items.\n\nButcher (red headband and white apron) Trades meats, sweet berries, rabbit stew, and dried kelp blocks.\n\nMason  [JE only ] / Stone Mason  [BE only ] (black apron and black gloves) Trades polished stones, terracotta, clay, glazed terracotta, and quartz.\n\nNitwit (green coated, no badge) No trades, no badge Unemployed (no overlay, base clothing of biome without any extra features) No trades until employed.\n\nNo badge until employed.\n\nMain article: Trading The Java Edition trading interface, displaying basic novice-level trading options.\n\nTrading options of a max-level weaponsmith.\n\nVillager badge changes color depending on the level of the villager.\n\nFrom left to right: stone (novice), iron (apprentice), gold (journeyman), emerald (expert), and diamond (master).\n\nThe trading system is a gameplay mechanic that allows players to buy and sell various items to and from villagers, using emeralds as a currency.\n\nTheir trades can be valuable or somewhat meaningless, depending on the cost, the items the player might get, and how the player treats the villagers.\n\nOnly adult villagers with professions can trade; the player cannot trade with nitwits, unemployed villagers, or baby villagers.\n\nAttempting to do so causes the villager to display a head-bobbling animation and play the villager's declined trade sound [Java Edition only ].\n\nUsing an employed villager allows a player to trade, making offers based on the villager's profession and profession level.\n\nAll offers involve emeralds as a currency, and items related to the villager's profession.\n\nTrading can allow the acquisition of items that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to obtain, such as enchanted books with \"treasure\" enchantments (e.g.\n\nMending), bottles o' enchanting, or chainmail armor.\n\nWhen a villager gets a new trade, they receive 10 seconds of Regeneration I (totaling to 4 of restoration), which emits pink particles.\n\nThe villager also emits green particles suggesting contentment.\n\nCompleting a trade with a villager increases its professional level.\n\nSome trades grant higher levels to the villager than others.\n\nAs it advances through its profession, the villager offers additional trades.\n\nWhen a villager unlocks a new trade at a higher level, it almost always grants more experience than lower-level trades.\n\nVillagers have a maximum supply of items and after the player has traded for an item that many times, the villager's supply of the item is exhausted.\n\nThis results in the trade being temporarily locked.\n\nA player can continue to trade for the villager's other available items if any.\n\nExhausted items are restocked when the villager works at a job site, up to twice per day.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, librarian villagers have a 50% chance to sell enchanted books as part of their trades at novice, apprentice, and journeyman-level, and have 1 \u2044 3 chance to sell enchanted books at expert-level as part of their trades, meaning each librarian villager can sell up to four books.\n\nThe price ranges between 5-64 emeralds per book.\n\nBased on the level of the enchantment and whether it is classified as a \" treasure enchantment \" (meaning they are not obtainable by enchanting, e.g.\n\nMending), which doubles the cost, or not a price is determined.\n\nIn Java Edition, librarian villagers have a 2 \u2044 3 chance to sell an enchanted book as part of their trades at the novice, apprentice, and journeyman level, and have a 50% chance to sell an enchanted book at the expert level, meaning each librarian can sell up to four books.\n\nThe price ranges from 5-64 emeralds per book, depending on the enchantment's level as well as whether or not it is a treasure enchantment.\n\nCost of Enchanted Books based on their level Level Lowest Price Highest Price I (1) 5 19 II (2) 8 32 III (3) 11 45 IV (4) 14 58 V (5) 17 71 (capped at 64) They may contain any available enchantment (except Soul Speed and Swift Sneak) at any available level.\n\nSee trading notes for more information on enchantments and prices.\n\nClicking use on an unemployed or nitwit villager in Java Edition causes it to grunt and bobble their head; doing so in Bedrock Edition does nothing.\n\nUsing a name tag on a villager always names the villager instead of opening the trading interface.\n\nFor detailed information on Villager economics, see Trading \u00a7 Economics.\n\nThe price of an item can rise and fall with changes in demand.\n\nThe price of a traded item can rise when next resupplied, or fall from a risen price if not traded.\n\nDemand is stored per item, not per villager.\n\nSeveral villagers offering trade items to a player.\n\nWhen a player holds an item near a villager who wants that item, the villager holds up an item it offers in exchange.\n\nFor example, a farmer villager who buys 20 wheat for one emerald holds up an emerald, offering it to a player holding wheat.\n\nVillagers do not offer trades that are currently out of stock.\n\nIf the villager has more than one trade for an item, it cycles through the trades, offering a different item every few seconds.\n\nThis kind of trading interaction makes it easier to find villagers who offer a particular trade, but the player must still open the trading interface to complete the trade.\n\nNote that villagers do not hold items to offer trades during their gather or sleep phases, even though it is still possible to trade with them.\n\nVillagers have levels and require experience to unlock the next tiers of trade: level 1 is a novice, level 2 is apprentice, level 3 is journeyman, level 4 is expert, and level 5 is master.\n\nVillagers can resupply trades by themselves by working more at their job site block.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, villagers increase their prices of trades if a player's popularity is low, (e.g.\n\nfrom damaging villagers), and decrease it if their popularity is high (e.g.\n\nfrom trading with multiple villagers).\n\nCuring a zombie villager also increases the player's popularity by 10.\n\nIn Java Edition, a villager's prices are affected by the player's reputation with that villager rather than by village popularity.\n\nMain article: Hero of the Village When a player receives Hero of the Village, players receive discounted prices on all the items traded by villagers in both editions.\n\nThe Hero of the Village also gets gifts. [Java Edition only ] Each villager throws gifts related to its profession, and nitwits and unemployed villagers throw wheat seeds instead.\n\nThese gifts range in value from common (like seeds) to rare items (like chainmail armor).\n\nA player's popularity increases by 10 in Java Edition and doesn't increase in Bedrock Edition.\n\nVillagers also shoot off fireworks, with different colored fireworks with no pattern.\n\nAn example of a zombie villager.\n\nMain article: Zombie Villager When a zombie kills a villager, it can turn the villager into a zombie villager, depending on the difficulty: 0% chance on Easy, 50% chance on Normal, and 100% chance on Hard.\n\nZombie villagers also spawn naturally in the Overworld in the same conditions as a normal zombie, although much less commonly, with a 5% chance.\n\nZombie villagers also spawn in abandoned villages (zombie villages) and igloos.\n\nThey do not spawn from the zombie monster spawner.\n\nA wandering trader.\n\nMain article: Wandering Trader Wandering traders are passive mobs that spawn randomly close to the player in both editions, or periodically in village gathering sites in Bedrock Edition.\n\nWandering traders also spawn near bells.\n\nTwo trader llamas spawn leashed to the wandering trader when a wandering trader is naturally spawned, and in Bedrock Edition when summoned or spawned using a spawn egg.\n\nPlayers may use emeralds to buy items from wandering traders without the need of unlocking the previous trade, but cannot trade items for emeralds.\n\nThey also lock trades like villagers, but never unlock the trade, nor can they work at any job site blocks.\n\nLike villagers, wandering traders are attacked by most zombie variants (though they do not have a zombified form, they die if a zombie kills it, even on hard difficulty), illagers, ravagers  [Java Edition only ], and vexes.\n\nWandering traders also drink a Potion of Invisibility at night (or when they see a hostile mob such as an illager or zombie).\n\nThey also drink a milk bucket in the morning to remove the Invisibility.\n\nThey despawn after 40 minutes (even with a name tag or in a minecart or boat) with their llamas.\n\nJava Edition: Villagers use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: \u2191 Can be multiplied by 1.0 or 0.92 for each sound Bedrock Edition: \u2191 1.0 for all except fire_crackle4 (the last sound), which is 0.8 \u2191 Can be 1.0 or 0.92 for each sound Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Villagers have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Additional fields for mobs that can breed Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Tags common to all villagers Inventory: Each compound tag in this list is an item in the villager's inventory, up to a maximum of 8 slots.\n\nItems in two or more slots that can be stacked together are automatically condensed into one slot.\n\nIf there are more than 8 slots, the last slot is removed until the total is 8.\n\nIf there are 9 slots but two previous slots can be condensed, the last slot returns after the two other slots are combined.\n\nAn item in the inventory, excluding the Slot tag.\n\nTags common to all items LastRestock: The last tick the villager went to their job site block to

the last restock, or 0 if the villager has not restocked in the last 10 minutes.\n\nWhen a villager has restocked twice in less than 10 minutes, it waits at least 10 minutes for another restock.\n\nWilling: 1 or 0 (true/false) \u2013 true if the villager is willing to mate.\n\nBecomes true after certain trades (those that would cause offers to be refreshed), and false after mating.\n\nMain article: Villager/DV [edit ] Main article: Villager/DV2 [edit ] Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nFor the history of the villager before Village & Pillage, see Villager (old) \u00a7 History.\n\nIssues relating to \"Villager\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe villagers were inspired by the shopkeepers in Dungeon Master II.\n\n[15] Originally, the mobs populating villages were to be pigmen.\n\n[16] When a villager is in love mode, it walks slowly.\n\nHowever, when a villager runs indoors as the night falls, it runs faster than the player's sprinting speed.\n\nBaby villagers taking poppies out of Iron Golem's hands is a reference to the 1986 Japanese animated movie Castle in the Sky, in which a giant robot covered in vines (inspiration for the iron golem) gives the main characters flowers to put on a memorial.\n\n[17] The villager skins added in the Village and Pillage update were inspired by 2018 fashion shows, such as Gucci's.\n\n[18] Villagers are genderless, meaning they are neither male nor female.\n\n[19] Villagers occasionally sleep in odd ways during the night inside their beds, sometimes hanging halfway off the side of the bed or even glitching into walls.\n\nAlthough the villages in snowy taiga biomes spawn the snowy villager variant in Bedrock Edition, they use the taiga village variant.\n\nIn Java Edition, when the Programmer Art resource pack is enabled, all villagers wear a green hood on their heads.\n\n[20] This is because the Programmer Art nitwit texture (which is directly copied from the pre-1.14 vanilla resource pack and had the hood in the texture since its addition) is called the same as the Village & Pillage base villager texture (...\\entity\\villager\\villager.png).\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, when the Classic Textures pack from the Marketplace is enabled, the villagers still use their default texture instead of the old texture.\n\n[21] This is because the old textures of villager are located in...\\entity\\villager, while the textures for new villagers are in...\\entity\\villager2.\n\nIn Java Edition, baby villagers are the only mobs that do not have a disproportionately large head compared to their adult counterparts.\n\nRather, they are smaller versions of the adult villager.\n\nGiving a villager any item (with commands) causes it to hold the item as if offering it, but it cannot be traded.\n\nFisherman villagers have been intentionally textured by Jasper Boerstra to display the long-since-removed raw fish texture.\n\n[22] Villagers display their held items differently than most creatures do, using the \"ground\" parameter instead of the usual hand parameter in model display settings.\n\nVillagers (and

[JE only ] Vindicators are sometimes neutral if naturally spawned in a woodland mansion, which means that the vindicator does not attack the player on sight, but only after the player attacks it.\n\nMain article: Patrol In Java Edition, any vindicators can join a patrol if sufficiently near a patrol captain, but do not go seeking out for patrols to join.\n\nMain article: Raid Vindicators can spawn during raids.\n\nThey appear more frequently during later waves and at higher difficulties.\n\nVindicators can spawn riding ravagers, creating a vindicator ravager jockey. [JE only ] In Java Edition, if a player spawns a vindicator with a spawn egg or using a command, the vindicator has a chance of becoming an illager captain, with a Ominous banner attached above its back.\n\nA vindicator drops loot only when killed by a player or tamed wolf: 5 and an additional 1\u20133 per naturally-spawned equipment.\n\n0\u20131 emeralds when killed by the player.\n\nThe maximum increases by 1 for every level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-4 with Looting III.\n\n8.5% chance of dropping their normal or enchanted iron axe, which increases by 1% per level of Looting with random durability.\n\n1 Ominous banner (in Java Edition), or illager banner in Bedrock Edition if they spawn as a raid captain.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, if a vindicator spawns as part of a raid, it drops: 0-1 Emerald Additionally, in Bedrock Edition, vindicators have a 65% chance of dropping the following on Easy and Normal difficulties, and an 80% chance of dropping them on Hard difficulty: 0-1 Emerald (10 \u2044 39 chance) 2-3 Emerald (5 \u2044 39 chance) 4-5 Emerald (2 \u2044 39 chance) 1 Enchanted Book (2 \u2044 39 chance) 1 Iron Axe (5 \u2044 78 chance) 1 Iron Pickaxe (5 \u2044 78 chance) 1 Iron Shovel (5 \u2044 78 chance) 1 Iron Sword (5 \u2044 78 chance) 1 Iron Helmet (5 \u2044 78 chance) 1 Iron Chestplate (5 \u2044 78 chance) 1 Iron Leggings (5 \u2044 78 chance) 1 Iron Boots (5 \u2044 78 chance) Notes: Iron equipment from raid drops always has a 50% chance of being enchanted with a random enchantment at level 5-19.\n\nIron equipment from raid drops is always damaged.\n\nThese drops are also affected by the Looting enchantment.\n\nThe enchanted book has a level 30 enchantment, may be treasure enchantment.\n\nEmeralds are both a regular raid drop and an additional raid drop.\n\nWith Looting III enchantment, a vindicator has spawned from a raid can drop up to 16 emeralds upon death, but the chance is 3.328% on Easy or Normal, and 4.096% on Hard.\n\nIt is possible for a vindicator spawned from a raid to drop both its naturally-spawned iron axe and a second iron axe from its additional raid drops (in Easy and Normal difficulty 0.3536% chance, 0.3952% chance with Looting I, 0.4368% chance with Looting II, and 0.4784% chance with Looting III, while in Hard difficulty 0.4352% chance, 0.4864% chance with Looting I, 0.5376% chance with Looting II, and 0.5888% chance with Looting III).\n\nA vindicator captain chasing a Villager.\n\nVindicators are hostile toward players, iron golems, adult villagers, wandering traders, and snow golems. [BE only ] In Bedrock Edition, vindicators are passive to players on Peaceful difficulty but will still attack other mobs.\n\nWhile idle, a vindicator crosses its arms similar to a villager, with its axe stowed.\n\nWhile giving chase, the vindicator brandishes its axe and sprints.\n\nIf it has no weapons, a mainhand-unarmed vindicator raises both of its hands when attacking.\n\nOn Normal and Hard difficulties, vindicators that are part of a raid can break wooden doors.\n\nThis is controlled by the raider tag.\n\n[1] Like any illager during a raid, vindicators celebrate by cheering if all the villagers are killed or all the beds are destroyed.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, if a pillager arrow accidentally strikes a vindicator, the vindicator retaliates against the pillager, but the pillager does not retaliate.\n\nAll illagers remain friendly to each other in Java Edition, even when struck accidentally.\n\n[2] Vindicators are likely to call help from other vindicators when attacked by mobs or players (except for illagers and goats, or if they were killed in one hit), inciting them all to attack the aggressor.\n\nThey do not call help from other kinds of illagers.\n\nVindicator raiders can break doors and open doors like villagers.\n\n[needs testing ] Ringing a bell gives all vindicators within 32 blocks the Glowing effect for 3 seconds.\n\nVindicators can only sprint, even when idle.\n\nA dispenser can equip a vindicator with armor, but it is invisible and does not show on its model.\n\nArmed vindicators hit for 7.5 \u00d7 3.75 to 19.5 \u00d7 9.75 damage, depending on difficulty.\n\nThey tie with piglin brutes for dealing the third most melee damage in the game, following the iron golem at 21 \u00d7 10.5 damage and the warden at 45 \u00d7 22.5 damage.\n\nThe vindicator's axe attack disables the player's shield for 5 seconds, even when riding a ravager.\n\nA vindicator named Johnny (using a name tag, named spawn egg, etc., or has its Johnny tag set to 1b) is hostile to every mob except evokers, pillagers, other vindicators, ghasts [3] and players in Creative or Spectator mode.\n\nIn Java Edition, they also do not attack baby villagers, illusioners or armor stands [4].\n\nThis hostility extends to vexes, ravagers and witches in both editions.\n\n[5] \"Johnny\" vindicators will also attempt to attack the ender dragon, but it will not take damage.\n\nAll hostile or neutral mobs try to attack the \"Johnny\" vindicator in return, except for ender dragons, [verify ] endermites (as they die in one hit), guardians, elder guardians, phantoms, goats (apart from their usual ramming behavior), slimes, magma cubes, and ravagers.\n\nSince raid captains can instruct nearby pillagers to attack their target, naming a vindicator raid captain \"Johnny\" will cause other raiders to attack Johnny's target, even if they wouldn't usually.\n\nThis can cause witches, vexes and ravagers to target one another, and can even cause ravagers to attack themselves.\n\nIf this causes a witch to target a ravager, the witch will instead throw Splash Potions of healing, since ravagers are raid mobs.\n\nThe Johnny tag overrides its name; the player can give the vindicator any other name and set the Johnny tag to 1b and it remains hostile in the same way as described.\n\nConversely, the player can name the vindicator \" Johnny \" and set the Johnny tag to 0b, causing the vindicator to act as a normal vindicator.\n\nNaming a \"Johnny\" vindicator something else using a name tag will not set its Johnny tag to 0b, and it will continue to exhibit \"Johnny\" behavior. [Java Edition only ] Naming a vindicator spawn egg \"Johnny\" and using it on a spawner has no effect; normal vindicators spawn rather than vindicators named \"Johnny\".

[BE only ] When attacked by a player, a wandering trader flees from the player as a villager would do.\n\nThe llamas, however, attack the player by spitting if their master gets hit, except in Peaceful.\n\nThe llamas stop attacking if the player is killed and respawns, if the llamas are leashed after the wandering trader is killed, or if the player gets far enough away from them for a short period of time.\n\nDespite their similarities to villagers, attacking or killing wandering traders does not anger iron golems.\n\n[3] Unlike most other villager-like mobs, wandering traders do not visually sit down when riding objects such as boats and minecarts.\n\n[4] The trading UI of a wandering trader in Java Edition.\n\nFor the available trades for the wandering trader, see Trading \u00a7 Wandering trader.\n\nThe trading system is a gameplay mechanic that allows players to buy items with emeralds, but from a wandering trader this time.\n\nA player can click on the wandering trader to view the items offered for sale, similar to a villager.\n\nDifferent offers are visible in a list, and clicking on one of the offers moves the corresponding items to the slots above the player's inventory.\n\nAll offers involve emeralds as a currency.\n\nWandering traders typically sell items generated in the world or otherwise related to nature, such as plants, dyes, and buckets of fish.\n\nThey can also trade less common items, such as coral blocks, blue ice, or nautilus shells.\n\nOverall, trades offered by wandering traders offer a way to obtain biome-specific materials, without having to travel to the specific biomes.\n\nAfter the player purchases the same item several times, the wandering trader locks the trade, but unlike villagers, never unlocks the trade.\n\nThe wandering trader can appear again around the player with new trades after a while.\n\nWandering traders do not have the novice-master trading system like villagers.\n\nInstead, the player can buy anything from the wandering trader without the need of unlocking the previous trades.\n\nWandering traders do not increase or decrease the prices of its items being sold if attacked by the player, or if the player has the Hero of the Village effect.\n\nUnlike villagers, wandering traders only sell items, they do not buy items.\n\nWandering traders do not have an experience bar and do not modify their offers or prices based on changing demand.\n\nThis (the trade items or prices) can be changed by the player by editing the corresponding NBT data flag through the use of the / data  [JE only ] command.\n\nWandering traders are the only renewable source of sand, red sand, coral blocks, and small dripleaves.\n\nThe wandering trader cannot work at a job site block and restock, even summoned with a villager profession or other villager data.\n\nA milk bucket (8.5% chance, increased 1% per level of Looting) if killed while holding or before finishing drinking.\n\nA potion of invisibility (8.5% chance, increased 1% per level of Looting) if killed while holding or before finishing drinking.\n\nA wandering trader is also a source of leads, as it typically spawns with two leashed trader llamas.\n\nThese leads break and drop (at the location of the llama) if either trader or llama dies or if they are separated.\n\nWandering traders do not drop any loot when they despawn.\n\nWandering traders do not reward any experience when killed or when the player successfully trades with the wandering trader.\n\nJava Edition: Wandering traders use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 The first listed sound is 0.35;

drinking Witch (BE) Witch drinking (BE) Health 26 \u00d7 13 Behavior Hostile Spawn Light level of 0 in the Overworld When lightning strikes near a villager Inside swamp huts As a part of raids Damage Splash potion of harming: 6 Splash potion of poison 1 per 1.25 sec Poison for 45 sec (\u00d7 18) Details Size In Java Edition: Height: 1.95 blocks Width: 0.6 blocks In Bedrock Edition: Height: 1.9 blocks Width: 0.6 blocks Speed 0.25 The witch is a hostile mob that uses potions in combat, both in the form of weapons as splash potions and in the form of drinkable potions for defense.\n\nMain article: Tutorials/Witch farming The witch may spawn in the Overworld above opaque blocks at a light level of 0, in all biomes except mushroom fields and deep dark.\n\nEvery swamp hut spawns a witch and a cat inside during world generation both which never despawn.\n\nOtherwise, witches spawn in the hut.\n\nIn Java Edition, only witches spawn in the 7\u00d77\u00d79 volume that is the hut, which is the size of the roof and one block over the porch, from one level below the floor of the hut to two blocks above the roof.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the hut has a hardcoded spawn spot on which witches spawn: the spawn spot is the same for every hut.\n\nSome witches always spawn as part of raids starting from wave 4 in Bedrock Edition or wave 3 or 4 in Java Edition depending on the world difficulty.\n\nA villager transforms into a witch when lightning strikes within four blocks.\n\nThe witch transformed from a villager does not despawn and cannot be changed back into a villager.\n\nThis witch attacks the player with its potions even if the player traded with it before.\n\nThe rooftop and scale of a swamp hut, as well as the spawning zone.\n\nThe spawn area matches the roof, plus the porch.\n\n(Java Edition) Shows the side of a swamp hut, also shows the scale of it and proper height.\n\n(Java Edition) Witches spawn on the northwest corner of the spawn spot, which is marked with a block of lapis lazuli in this picture.\n\n(Bedrock Edition) Witches are a source of potion ingredients and are the only mobs that are able to spawn in the small area around a swamp hut.\n\nThese huts are the best place to farm witches, but they require spawning platforms and light levels of 0.\n\nA hut can support a maximum of three spawning platforms.\n\nWitch huts generate in swamp biomes sometimes, but the witch-exclusiveness depends on the entire hut being inside a swamp biome.\n\nIn raids found in villages, it is more worthwhile to simply build an illager farm and deal with witches as they spawn.\n\nA witch drops 5 experience orbs when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nWitches have the largest loot table of any mob, making one to three drops of zero to two items each, for a maximum of six items total.\n\nA witch may drop Stick, Glass Bottle, Glowstone Dust, Redstone Dust, Spider Eye, Gunpowder or Sugar.\n\n[1] The likelihood of a witch to drop sticks is 25%, while the remaining items have a probability of 12.5%.\n\nThe odds of a witch dropping the maximum amount of items possible without a Looting enchantment are 1 in 81 (1.2%).\n\nEach level of Looting increases the maximum items dropped by one for each of the one to three drops, leading to a maximum of five items per drop and a maximum of fifteen items total.\n\nNo Looting averages two items per kill, Looting I averages three, Looting II averages four and Looting III averages five.\n\nA potion has a 8.5% chance of dropping if a witch is killed while drinking the potion increased by 1% for every level of Looting.\n\nA witch drops one of the following in this case: Potion of Healing Potion of Fire Resistance Potion of Swiftness Potion of Water Breathing A witch is neither an illager nor a villager.\n\nWitches do not use housing, the equipment in their swamp huts and cannot open doors.\n\nWitches are peaceful toward villagers and wandering traders when not participating in raids, although their potions can hit one by accident.\n\nIn Java Edition, witches are given the Glowing effect for 3 seconds when a bell is rung within 32 blocks of them.\n\nThis applies to all witches, regardless of whether they participate in raids or not.\n\nThe poison, instant damage, evoker fangs, warden's sonic boom, and the Thorns enchantment magical sources are 85% less effective against witches.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, witches are immune to poison, fatal poison and to their own thrown harming potions.\n\nThe particle effect that witches emit.\n\nWitches have a 1.5% chance every second to spawn 10 to 44 ornamental particles above their heads, named \u201cwitch\u201d in Java Edition or \u201cwitchspell\u201d in Bedrock Edition and purple in color.\n\nA witch pursues the player within 16 blocks and uses potions of the first level in combat, throwing splash potions offensively and drinking potions defensively.\n\nThese potions are the same as ones obtainable through brewing, with the same duration.\n\nA witch has an infinite stock of potions, even when transformed from a villager or not having had any potions equipped in their inventory.\n\nEach potion chosen by the witch depends on the circumstance and is thrown within ten blocks and in a three-second interval.\n\nThe witch throws a splash potion of Slowness if the player is eight, nine or ten blocks away and does not already have the Slowness effect.\n\nThis makes it harder for the player to escape if they attempt to.\n\nThe witch throws a splash potion of Poison if the player's health is at least 8 and is not already poisoned.\n\nThe witch has a 25% chance of throwing a splash potion of Weakness if the player is 3 or less blocks away and does not already have the Weakness effect.\n\nThis is used to weaken the player's melee attacks on the witch if they attempt to.\n\nThis Weakness effect can be used to cure zombie villagers.\n\nIf none of the above conditions are true, the witch defaults to using a splash potion of Harming, which does 6 magical damage.\n\nA witch may choose to equip and drink a potion each game tick (1 \u2044 20 second) if it is not already drinking a potion.\n\nDrinking the potion takes 1.6 seconds [2] and slows down its moving speed.\n\nIt does not attack during this time.\n\nWhen 80% under water and lacking Water Breathing, there is a 15% chance of drinking a potion of Water Breathing.\n\nWhen on fire or the last damage taken in the past 2 seconds was fire damage, there is a 15% chance of drinking a potion of Fire Resistance.\n\nWhen not at full health, there is a 5% chance of drinking a potion of Healing, which heals 4.\n\n[3] When the witch is eleven or more blocks from a target and does not have the Speed effect, there is a 50% chance of drinking a potion of Swiftness.\n\nAs a result, witches are difficult to kill via suffocation or cacti due to their frequent use of healing potions, cannot drown underwater and require a long time to die in lava or fire.\n\nIf the raid members kill all the villagers in a village, witches jump in commemoration to their victory.\n\nIn Java Edition, any witch can join a patrol if sufficiently near a patrol captain.\n\nThese witches are hostile towards villagers, wandering traders and iron golems if in their sight.\n\nWitches that participate in a raid seek out illagers and ravagers and throw splash potions of Regeneration of 45 seconds or Instant Health if they have 4 or less.\n\nWitches do not retaliate when attacked by evoker fangs, illagers, or harming potions from other witches.\n\nInstead, they drink a beneficial potion.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, witches participating in a raid do not heal other illagers [until BE 1.20.30 ], but still attack the player, iron golems and snow golems.\n\nWitches throw negative splash potions at any mob that attacks it, including other witches and illagers.\n\nJava Edition: Witches use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 Except for the second copy of ambient5, which is 0.72-1.08 Bedrock Edition: \u2191 a b 0.8-1.2 for all except the copy of ambient5, the first sound in the

[Java Edition only ] If any type of zombie kills a villager, there is a chance for the villager to transform into a zombie villager.\n\nIn Java Edition a zombified zombie villager does not despawn if the player has traded with it at least once prior to its death, but unlike all other persistent mobs it still counts toward the hostile mob cap.\n\nIf the zombie villager picks up any item however, it remains persistent but is excluded from the mob cap.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition all zombified villagers are persistent.\n\nA zombie villager appears alongside a cleric villager in every igloo basement (a normal zombie villager in Bedrock Edition  [until BE 1.20.30 ] and a cleric zombie villager in Java Edition  [upcoming: BE 1.20.30 ]).\n\nOne of them transforms into a leatherworker, due to the workstation (a cauldron).\n\nThey also generate as part of abandoned villages.\n\nZombie villagers generated in both of these structures do not despawn naturally.\n\nAll mobs that can be ridden by baby zombie villagers in Bedrock Edition.\n\nBaby zombie villagers make up 5% of zombie villager spawns.\n\nThey have big heads, unlike normal baby villagers.\n\nThey behave similarly to regular zombie villagers, with the following differences: They are 30% faster than normal zombies, yet they have the same health as normal zombies.\n\nThis makes baby zombie villagers more dangerous than their bigger counterparts.\n\nThe noises they make are higher-pitched than adult zombie villager sound effects.\n\nIn Java Edition, baby zombie villagers have a chance to spawn as a chicken jockey.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, 10% of naturally spawned baby zombie villagers can start riding a mob and become a jockey when it tries attacking a villager, player, or golem.\n\nThey can ride: Adult chickens Untamed ocelots Untamed cats Untamed wolves Adult zombies Adult husks Adult zombified villagers Adult zombified piglins Cows Adult unsaddled pigs Sheep Adult untamed horses Adult untamed donkeys Adult untamed mules Adult skeleton horses Adult zombie horses Mooshrooms Spiders that was not spawned as a jockey mount Cave spiders that was not spawned as a jockey mount Pandas Baby zombie villagers turn into baby villagers, if cured.\n\nIn Java Edition, their heads turn back to small baby villager heads.\n\nWorn armor shrinks to fit their body size.\n\nThey are able to fit through 1\u00d71 block gaps.\n\nThey drop 12 experience when killed by the player instead of 5.\n\nUnlike most other baby mobs in the game, they stay as babies indefinitely and never grow into \"adult\" zombie villagers.\n\nThey have a decreased hitbox size.\n\nBaby zombie villagers are spawned when a zombie kills a baby villager, the chance of infection being the same as adult zombie villagers.\n\nBaby zombie villagers also spawn naturally, but the combined chance (5% villagers \u00d7 5% babies) is low at 0.25% (or 1 in 400 chance) of all newly spawned zombies.\n\nAlong with skeletons and regular zombies, some zombie villagers are capable of picking up dropped items.\n\nThese zombie villagers automatically pick up and hold any item that they come across (except jack o'lanterns  [Java Edition only ], mob heads and pumpkins, as these are worn on their heads), and use any armor, weapons, or tools picked up.\n\nIf they encounter another similar item, they pick it up and drop their previous item: if the new item is armor or a sword and the old item was not (for example, zombie villagers prefer swords to pickaxes and helmets to pumpkins), if both items are armor/swords and the new item is better damage-wise (reduces more damage for armor, or inflicts more damage for swords), if both items are armor/swords with the same damage reduction/infliction, the new item has NBT tags while the old does not or the new item is more damaged than the old item, or if both items are bows and the new item has NBT tags while the old does not.\n\nItems dropped by mobs in exchange for another cannot be picked up by players or mobs for 10 game ticks (0.5 seconds, barring lag), but can be picked up by hoppers.\n\nArmor worn by zombie villagers is not damaged from most damage sources, which means it cannot \"wear out\" the way player armor does.\n\nHelmets (not blocks like pumpkins) on zombie villagers can wear away and break if the zombie villager is exposed to daylight, or has an anvil or other falling block dropped on its head.\n\nZombie villagers also have a natural armor rating of 2 (), which gives 1.6 - 8% damage reduction from most sources.\n\nSome zombie villagers that are capable of picking up items spawn already in possession of such items, and those items may also be enchanted.\n\nThe chances of that event are listed below.\n\nIf a zombie villager spawns wearing multiple pieces of armor, the armor is never mismatched (i.e.\n\nall pieces are made of the same material).\n\n\u2191 a b c d e f g h i Value is based on the regional difficulty.\n\n\u2191 a b Enchantment is the same as on an enchantment table at level 5\u201322.\n\n[note 1] \u2191 1 \u2044 3 chance of an iron sword, 2 \u2044 3 chance of an iron shovel If a zombie does spawn with armor, the chances of specific armor are as follows: The chances of it being of a particular material are: Any zombie villager that spawns with equipment (picked-up items don't count) drop 1\u20133 extra experience per item.\n\nIn Java Edition  [upcoming: BE 1.20.30 ], a zombie villager retains its biome and profession after conversion from a villager.\n\nThey also retain their trades.\n\nBelow is a table of the variant and what workstation it required before zombification.\n\nThe zombie villager cannot work at a job site block.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, zombie villagers do not display their professions, but they still have the same profession after curing as before zombification.\n\nThey use the texture of an unemployed villager from their corresponding biome.\n\nBelow is a table listing the various professions, along with the specific job site block that each profession requires: \u2191 In Bedrock Edition  [until BE 1.20.30 ], all naturally spawned zombie villagers use the unemployed textures.\n\nWhen they die, zombie villagers drop 0\u20132 rotten flesh.\n\nThe maximum drop is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-5 with Looting III.\n\nThey can also drop an iron ingot, carrot, or potato when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nThis drop has a 2.5% chance of occurring, increasing by 1% per level of looting.\n\nIndividual items have the following chances of dropping: 1 \u2044 120 (about 0.83%) 7 \u2044 600 (about 1.17%) with Looting I 9 \u2044 600 (1.50%) with Looting II 11 \u2044 600 (about 1.83%) with Looting III Any picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping on death or when cured and drops with the same damage level it had when picked up.\n\nCarved Pumpkin [note 1] Jack o'Lantern  [Java Edition only ] [note 1] Iron Shovel Iron Sword Random Armor Zombie villagers have an 8.5% chance of dropping their naturally-spawned equipment (other than Halloween pumpkins), and drop it with a random durability.\n\nEach level of Looting increases the chance 1 percentage point (11.5% with Looting III).\n\n\u2191 a b Zombie villagers spawn with pumpkins and jack o'lanterns  [Java Edition only ] only during Halloween.\n\nAdult zombie villagers drop 5 and an additional 1\u20133 per naturally-spawned equipment.\n\nBaby zombie villagers drop 12 experience.\n\nMain article: Zombie \u00a7 Behavior Zombie villagers behave as ordinary zombies, except that they do not convert to drowned when submerged.\n\nIn Java Edition, zombie villagers that were converted from villagers retain their professions and clothes, which gain a tattered appearance.\n\nNaturally spawned zombie villagers (or ones spawned with spawn eggs) have a random profession that is not retained upon being cured; instead, they become unemployed and may gain a new profession if a job site block is nearby.\n\nZombie villagers can also spawn with the unemployed or Nitwit outfits.\n\nZombified nitwits remain nitwits after being cured.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, all zombie villagers have the same appearance, which looks like an unemployed zombie villager.\n\nNaturally spawned zombie villagers (or ones spawned with spawn eggs) have a random profession that is retained upon being cured.\n\nHowever, the profession is not locked and the cured villager may gain a new profession if in a village with an available job site block.\n\nZombie villagers can be unemployed, but they cannot be nitwits (zombified nitwit villagers become unemployed zombie villagers).\n\nBaby zombie villagers are always unemployed.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Curing a zombie villager Zombie villagers can be cured (converted to normal villagers) by first giving them the Weakness effect, which can be applied by: A splash potion of Weakness thrown by the player, a dispenser, or a witch.\n\nAn area effect cloud of Weakness from a creeper explosion [Java Edition only ], or a lingering potion.\n\nAn arrow of Weakness.\n\nThe / effect command, if cheats are enabled.\n\nThe weakened zombie villager must then be healed by using a (non-enchanted) golden apple on them.\n\nThe zombie villager begins to shudder to signal that curing is in progress.\n\nAlso, the Weakness effect is removed, replaced by Strength for the duration of the curing process.\n\nAn internal countdown timer is then started, counting down the total time to cure.\n\nTime to cure is initially 2000 ticks (nominally, 100 seconds or 1m 40s) in Bedrock Edition or a random integer between 3600 and 6000 ticks (180 to 300 seconds, 3\u20145 minutes) in Java Edition.\n\nOn each tick, there is a 1% chance for the game to look for cure accelerants.\n\nIt checks each block within a 9\u00d79\u00d79 cube centered on the villager for either an iron bar or a bed (either half: they're detected separately).\n\nFor each one found up to 14, there is a 30% chance of decreasing the countdown timer by 1 more tick.\n\nTherefore, having at least 14 half-beds and/or iron bars within range speeds up conversion by an average of 4.2%.\n\n[1] During the curing process the zombie villager behaves like a normal zombie except that it gains Strength (with a potency that doesn't depend on the difficulty level).\n\nThus, a zombie villager is more dangerous during curing than at other times.\n\nAt the end of the curing process, the zombie villager transforms into a villager and gains the Nausea effect for 10 seconds (which has no effect on the villager's behavior).\n\nIf it was holding any item it picked up, that item is dropped (unless it was enchanted with Curse of Binding, in which case it remains in the villager's inventory but is not worn and will not be dropped if the villager is killed).\n\nIf it was a baby before it was transformed into a zombie villager, it remains a baby after the cure.\n\nIf it had traded with a player at least once, it recovers its former profession and inventory of trades.\n\nOtherwise, it recovers its profession but might immediately change it if it finds and claims a workstation block for a different profession.\n\nA newly-cured villager, if it had a profession prior to being zombified, offers a trading discount to the player who administered the cure.\n\nThese discounts are permanent.\n\nIf a villager is cured more than once, the discounts get deeper until the price reaches the minimum of one emerald.\n\nVillagers near the cured villager are also affected but offer fewer, smaller discounts.\n\nZombie villagers that are in the process of converting do not despawn if the player moves far away from them, but like all monsters, they despawn if the difficulty is changed to Peaceful.\n\nIf a zombie villager spawned as a nitwit or was a nitwit before it was transformed into a zombie villager, it remains a nitwit if cured.\n\nCuring a villager spreads minor_positive gossip through the villager gossip system.\n\nA former nitwit zombie villager becomes an unemployed villager and can learn a profession after the cure.\n\nVillagers who were unemployed before transforming into a zombie villager might immediately claim a workstation to gain a profession.\n\nVillagers in a range of 16 blocks in a cube surrounding the cured villager also offer a small discount proportional to the number of cured villagers (up to 10).\n\nSaving and reloading the world causes the curing process to finish as soon as the chunk containing the villager is ticked.\n\nThis does not happen if the player moves out of range, then returns: In that case, the countdown timer pauses until the player returns.\n\nJava Edition: Zombie villagers use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b MC-226770 \u2191 MC-218122 Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Zombie villagers have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nJava Edition: Main article:

positive for the number of ticks until conversion back into a villager.\n\nThe regeneration effect parallels this.\n\nConversionPlayer: The UUID of the player who started curing the zombie, stored as

\"Zombie Villager\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nZombie villagers never spawn with equipment in Bedrock Edition due to having rendering issues with armor on

[JE only ]) In Bedrock Edition, evokers can spawn in peaceful difficulty, and will not attack the player.\n\nEvokers can spawn during raids by themselves or riding ravagers.\n\nEvokers cannot spawn in raids in easy difficulty, because such raids have only three waves, while evokers appear in the fifth wave and above.\n\nEvokers spawn during raids starting at wave 5.\n\nUp to 5 evokers spawn on hard difficulty.\n\nDuring these events, they can be a raid captain.\n\nOn hard difficulty, evokers can also spawn riding a ravager at wave 7.\n\nThey may also rarely spawn as a raid captain.\n\nUp to 5 evokers spawn during raids, with 1 evoker spawning during waves 5 and 6, and 3 evokers spawning during wave 7.\n\nOne of them rides a ravager during wave 7.\n\n1 Totem of Undying.\n\nThe Looting

player or tamed wolf.\n\nAn evoker moves at the player's sprinting speed, crosses its arms and does not show its hands.\n\nAn evoker visually does not sit down when sitting in a boat or minecart.\n\nIf an evoker is riding a ravager, its legs appear to sink in the ravager's body.\n\nThis only happens in Bedrock Edition, as evokers put their legs in front of them while sitting on any entity in Java Edition.\n\nAn evoker attacking with its fangs.\n\nEvokers attack players, adult villagers, iron golems, snow golems  [BE only ] and wandering traders within 12 blocks by rising and waving both of their arms while looking at their target and summoning magical fangs or vexes, creating different colored particles for the different attacks.\n\nIf the player is within a 10 block radius and the evoker is not in the middle of summoning an attack, the evoker flees from the player to avoid being attacked.\n\nAn evoker summoning fangs in two circles around it.\n\nEvokers are passive in Peaceful difficulty  [BE only ].\n\nThey will still attack any adult villagers, iron golems, wandering traders, or snow golems in the Peaceful difficulty.\n\nIf an evoker is attacked, all nearby [needs testing ] evokers become alerted and start attacking the player, even if they are behind walls.\n\nIn Java Edition, the alerted evokers can attack the player from an infinite distance away, even if the player switches to Creative or Spectator mode [1]; this can be fixed by relogging the world, or by setting the game rule universalAnger to True [needs testing ].\n\nIn Java Edition, an evoker is passive to other illagers even if it is harmed.\n\nAny evoker can search for and join a patrol if sufficiently near a patrol captain.\n\nIn Java Edition, evokers and illusioners are faster without any effects during raids.\n\nIn Java Edition, evokers are given 3 seconds of the Glowing effect if a bell is rung within 32 blocks of them.\n\nThis applies to both evokers spawned in raids and evokers spawned in woodland mansions.\n\nEvokers flee from creakings when within 8 blocks of them.\n\nThe evoker signals this attack by producing purple particles () and a low-pitched sound.\n\nA number of fangs rise out of the ground around the player, then snap shut and vanish.\n\nPlayers or mobs caught in the attack are dealt 6 damage, regardless of difficulty.\n\nThis harm is not mitigated by armor but is mitigated by enchantments such as Protection.\n\nAny evoker-summoned fangs do not deal damage to any illagers (witches are not illagers, so can be damaged and will retaliate [other than in a raid, in which case the witch will drink a beneficial potion and ignore [needs testing ] ]), although fangs summoned or spawned by the player do.\n\nFangs appear no lower than the feet of the lowest combatant and no higher than one block above the feet of the highest combatant.\n\nFangs attempt to appear on the highest opaque block between those two extremes, but fail to spawn if they are obstructed by a solid block.\n\nIn practice, this means that fangs cannot spawn inside deep pits or on top of high walls, but may, for example, go up a staircase if the target is at the top and the evoker at the bottom, or vice versa.\n\nLikewise, an evoker floating in a boat on water cannot summon fangs against a player swimming or floating in a boat because there are no opaque blocks from which the fangs can appear.\n\nThe evoker typically summons 16 fangs in a straight line toward the target.\n\nHowever, if the target is within 3 blocks of the evoker, the evoker summons the fangs in two circles around itself: the smaller circle has 5 fangs and the larger has 8.\n\nThe fangs do not seek the player, thus the player is able to dodge them.\n\nSummoning fangs resets the evoker's spell cooldown to two seconds and resets the cooldown for summoning fangs to five seconds.\n\nIf a neutral or hostile mob is caught in an evoker's fang attack, the mob attacks the evoker.\n\nThe evoker signals this attack by producing white particles () for two seconds and a higher-pitched sound.\n\nThree vexes appear nearby.\n\nThe evoker can summon vexes as long as there are fewer than eight vexes within 16 blocks centered on the evoker.\n\nThis spell resets the evoker's spell cooldown to five seconds and resets the cooldown for summoning vexes to 17 seconds.\n\nAn evoker summoning vexes.\n\nIn Java Edition, evokers may summon two circle fangs while summoning vexes, without any cooldown.\n\nIt usually happens when a player melee attacks an evoker while it is summoning vexes.\n\nThe Minecraft Dungeons' evoker also feature this combo attack behavior.\n\nAn evoker using its sheep color conversion spell.\n\nWhile the evoker is not engaged in combat and / gamerule mobGriefing is set to true, it changes the wool color of any blue sheep within 16 blocks from blue to red.\n\nAfter the spell, the sheep is red.\n\nThe evoker signals this spell by producing orange particles () and making a \" wololo \" sound.\n\nThis spell resets the evoker's spell cooldown to three seconds and resets the cooldown for the sheep color conversion spell to seven seconds.\n\nEvokers look at the sheep they are using the spell on while they are doing the spell until they finish the spell.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, evokers can still change a sheep's color when / gamerule mobGriefing is set to false.\n\nThis section of the article is empty.\n\nYou can help by adding to it.\n\nThis article is about the evoker fangs in Minecraft.\n\nFor evoker fangs in Minecraft Dungeons, see MCD:Evoker \u00a7 Evoker fang.\n\nEvoker Fangs Behavior Does not exist Details Size Height: 0.8 Blocks Width: 0.5 Blocks Evoker fangs are the entities that evokers use to attack the player with their fang attack.\n\nEvoker fangs are not affected by the peaceful difficulty.\n\nThe individual fangs in an evoker's fang attacks each have a delay.\n\nBefore the delay is over, the fangs cannot be seen, although unlike truly invisible entities, fangs in warmup still have a visible debug hitbox.\n\nAfter the delay, the fangs expand into existence, snap shut, make critical hit particles and shrink out of sight again, dealing 6 magic damage to all mobs standing on the spot.\n\nKilling an evoker fang does not contribute to the Monster Hunter advancement or achievement.\n\nJava Edition: Evokers use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Main article: Entity

the actual \"wololo\" sound effect to use in the conversion sound effect.\n\nEvokers are referred to as 'evocation illagers' in the code for pre-1.13 and Bedrock Edition code.\n\nHitting an evoker in

[JE only ] The mob does attack villagers but ignores baby villagers, unlike zombie variants.\n\nName Face Behavior Notes Image Vex Hostile Vexes are capable of flight and can even move through blocks, occasionally lunging at the player in order to hit them with their iron sword.\n\nThey are only seen as minions summoned by the evokers.\n\nVexes drop nothing but experience  [JE only ].Vexes occasionally drop their own weapon  [BE only ].\n\nWitch Hostile Witches are spell casting non-Illager allies that wield their various potions in combat, both hindering players and healing themselves and ally mobs around them.\n\nThey spawn naturally at night, in swamp huts, during raids, and if a villager is struck by lightning.\n\nWitches occasionally drop sticks, glass bottles, glowstone dust, redstone dust, spider eyes, gunpowder, sugar, and potions.\n\nRavager Hostile Ravagers are large, powerful beasts that will charge at their prey and bite down on them with their jaws.\n\nWhile they can be stunned with a shield, they will let out a deadly roar once they snap out of it.\n\nThey can only spawn in raids.\n\nRavagers drop saddles.\n\nA ravager jockey is an illager that spawns riding a ravager.\n\nThe riders can be pillagers, vindicators, or evokers.\n\nJava Edition A ravager ridden by a pillager spawns at raids in wave 5.\n\nRavagers ridden by vindicators and evokers spawn at wave 7.\n\nBedrock Edition A ravager ridden by pillager spawns at raids in waves 5 and 7.\n\nRavagers ridden by evokers also spawn at wave 7.\n\nThe ravagers ridden by vindicators do not spawn in raids, and can be spawned only with commands.\n\nIllagers spawn naturally in patrol and raids.\n\nThey always spawn naturally in groups while in patrols and raids, or inside their structures.\n\nPillagers spawn in pillager outposts.\n\nVindicators and evokers spawn in woodland mansions.\n\nOnly pillagers, vindicators, and evokers spawn naturally.\n\nVindicators and evokers that spawn naturally in woodland mansions do not despawn or respawn.\n\nRavagers spawn exclusively in raids.\n\nMain article: Raid captain Illagers sometimes have their own captain.\n\nAny illager has a small chance to be a raid captain with an ominous banner (even when using a spawn egg  [Java Edition only ], or when summoned by commands).\n\nRaid captains can spawn in raids [Java Edition only ] and patrols.\n\n[more information needed ] in Java Edition, the ominous banner equips on the illager's helmet slot.\n\nin Bedrock Edition, the illager banner equips on the illager's chestplate

landscape and monitoring the villages.\n\nRaid \u2014 waves of illagers and witches spawn and attack a village with ominous horn blares.\n\nin Java Edition, An illager captain spawns in each wave with other illagers, usually with a vindicator as the captain.\n\nIt is triggered when a player with the Bad Omen Bad Omen status effect enters a village.\n\nRaiders and villagers usually have different behavior in a raid.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, any killed raiders drops special loot.\n\nBoth raiders and villagers celebrate after defeating or saving a village respectively.\n\nMain Articles: Ominous Bottle, Bad Omen, and Hero of the Village Killing a raid captain in patrols, in a mansion, [JE only ] or in an outpost drops an Ominous Bottle.\n\nWhen drunk, this triggers the Bad Omen effect.\n\nBad Omen triggers a raid when that player enters a village with the effect still active.\n\nThe level of the effect increases the enchantment power of pillagers' and vindicators' crossbows and axes, respectively, and omens with a level higher than 1 cause an extra wave of raiders to occur  [JE only ].\n\nWhen all waves have been finished in a raid, the Hero of the Village effect is given, which decreases prices when trading with villagers.\n\nThe level of the effect scales with the level of the omen that triggered the raid.\n\nMain article: MCD:Illageralt The illageralt alphabet.\n\nIllagers have an alphabet called illageralt, a rune font from Minecraft Dungeons.\n\nThis font is currently usable only via commands.\n\nAll illagers ignore baby villagers, but may still hit them by accident.\n\nIllagers do not retaliate when hit by a missed arrow shot by a pillager or illusioner.\n\nA vindicator can disable the player's shield with its iron axe attack, even when riding a mob.\n\nIf a player fails to land a melee attack on a vindicator that rides a ravager during a raid in Hard difficulty, the vindicator rider can deal great damage to a player without protection from a shield.\n\nAll illagers, ravagers, and witches within 48 blocks of a bell that has been rung gain three seconds of the Glowing effect, effectively highlighting them through walls.\n\nOn all difficulty levels, damaged illager mobs call all other illagers of their respective type within an area centered on the attacked illager to target the attacker, as long as the attacker is a non-illager.\n\nFor example, pillagers attack a skeleton that injures another pillager, but pillagers do not aid a vindicator hit by a skeleton.\n\n[more information needed ] During raids, Vindicators can open doors like villagers.\n\nThey can break wooden doors in normal or hard difficulty, if they cannot open the door successfully.\n\n[2] Evokers and illusioners gain high movement speed without any effect.\n\nA raid captain spawns in each wave with other raiders, usually with a vindicator as the captain.\n\nIllagers pick up ominous banners dropped by raid captains, depends on how many raid captains die in this wave.\n\nIf the raid captain is still alive, they do not pick up the banner from last wave remains or if thrown by the player.\n\nAll illagers, ravagers, and witches join nearby patrol actively.\n\nIf a \"Johnny\" vindicator joins a patrol, all patrol members assume the \"Johnny\" vindicator's aggressive behavior.\n\nVindicators and evokers do not despawn and are passive on Peaceful difficulty.\n\nAll illagers and vexes ignore baby villagers, but pillagers and illusioners may still shoot them by accident.\n\nA dispenser can equip an evoker, vindicator, or pillager with armor.\n\nHowever, no armor is visible on them and no armor drops upon death.\n\nPillagers and ravagers do not purposefully attack other illagers.\n\nHowever, non-pillagers and non- ravager do attack pillagers who hit them with missed arrows.\n\n[3] Vindicators and evokers retaliate against a pillager if the pillager accidentally hits the vindicator or evoker with an arrow, although the evoker fang deals no damage to pillagers.\n\nVexes summoned by an injured evoker can still attack the pillager.\n\nA \" ravager with vindicator rider \" is unused in Bedrock Edition.\n\nIt can be summoned by a spawn event command without raid configuration.\n\nAfter the Texture Update, illagers still use the Java Edition 1.14 snapshot texture, including some of the Marketplace textures (for example, the pillager's arms).\n\n[4] [5] Also, a ravager's leg texture in Bedrock Edition is different from that in Java edition.\n\nAccording to Minecraft Mobestiary, illagers were \"expelled\" from villages due to their \"unspeakable activities\".\n\nAfter the release of Minecraft Dungeons, the setting of illagers has been changed and expanded.\n\n[6] Witches allied with the illagers during raids.\n\nCory

Illager hostile mob Behavior Hostile Damage Easy and normal: 2 \u2013 5 Hard: 3 \u2013 5 The illusioner is an unused illager armed with a bow.\n\nIt attacks using illusions and can also fire arrows.\n\nAn illusioner has no spawn egg in the Creative mode inventory.\n\nAn illusioner can be spawned only using data packs or the / summon illusioner in-game command.\n\nIllusioners do not spawn in woodland mansions or pillager outposts, nor at raids or patrols.\n\nSimilarly to the other unused giant and zombie horse mobs, illusioners do not spawn in any biome, monster spawner or world -generated structure.\n\nWhen an illusioner is killed by a player or a tamed wolf, any naturally spawned equipment, including its unenchanted bow, has an 8.5% chance of dropping (or 9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) and drops with a random item durability.\n\nIn addition, 5 experience orbs are dropped on player or tamed wolf kills.\n\nAn invisible illusioner captain and its four copies strafing.\n\nThe real banner is invisible.\n\nThe illusioner also drops one illager ominous banner if it is a raid captain.\n\nAlthough they do not naturally spawn in raids, illusioners spawned by the player attack players, adult villagers, iron golems and wandering traders within a 16*4*16 cubic area.\n\nAn illusioner joins a nearby raid if it occurs or joins a patrol if sufficiently near a patrol captain.\n\nThe illusioner attacks with its spells and its bow, firing an arrow every second.\n\nUnless the illusioner is summoned using commands, it cannot attack with a non-bow item in its hand, cannot use tipped arrows in its offhand slot (but can use spectral arrows) and cannot use enchanted bows.\n\nAlso, it is the only illager that can see its target through walls.\n\nThe Illusioner moves quickly on a semi-circular fashion and always tries to maintain a consistent distance between itself and the player, strafing from left to right and vice-versa, retreating if the player gets too close or advancing if the player retreats.\n\nFinally, the illusioner has two spells: a spell that blinds its opponent and a spell that summons visual pseudo-duplicates and makes the illusioner invisible.\n\nThe illusioner casts its blindness spell only if the regional difficulty is greater than 2.\n\nAs result, the world difficulty setting, the inhabited time of a chunk, the total daytime in the world and the phase of the moon from the day-night cycle affects its ability.\n\nAn illusioner's four false duplicates.\n\nThe real illusioner is invisible.\n\nAn illusioner casts a Blindness effect that lasts for 20 seconds upon first engaging a new player opponent.\n\nIt signals this attack by raising its arms during a short-timed animation, making a low pitched sound and producing a black mist of particles ().\n\nOther entities (typically a wolf, a snow golem or an iron golem) do not trigger this magic.\n\nThe illusioner does not cast this spell more than once on the same player opponent, unless it has first shifted its attention to another opponent and then back to that original opponent.\n\nThis spell resets the illusioner's spell cooldown to 1 second and resets the cooldown for the blinding spell to 9 seconds.\n\nAs long as an illusioner is engaged in combat, it casts an Invisibility status effect on itself that lasts 60 seconds and refreshes the effect whenever the Invisibility's time runs out.\n\nThe illusioner signals this spell by raising its arms, making a strange high pitched sound and producing a blue mist of particles called \"mirror\" ().\n\nWhen an illusioner becomes invisible through this or another method, it creates four false duplicates of itself.\n\nThese hover and waver at short distances from the actually invisible illusioner, though they do not space themselves out until the first time the illusioner is attacked.\n\nThey face in exactly the same direction as the illusioner and move somewhat in step with the original, appearing to no-clip through blocks like a vex does.\n\nDespite using the shooting animation whenever the original uses its bow, only the real illusioner can shoot and be damaged.\n\nThe clones move to new positions if they were not triggered and are still bunched together.\n\nThe Illusioner can also do this once in a while to \"refresh\" the clones' positions.\n\nWhen the real illusioner is damaged, its duplicates all snap back to where the real illusioner is, then quickly snap back out to new positions, making a teleporting sound, signaling the hit.\n\nIf an invisible illusioner receives the Glowing effect, all of the duplicates glow, while the true illusioner remains invisible.\n\nMoreover, only the invisible illusioner burns when catching fire.\n\nThe duplicates dissipate once the illusioner's Invisibility effect ends.\n\nThis spell resets the illusioner's spell cooldown to 1 second and resets the cooldown for the invisibility spell to 17 seconds.\n\nIllusioners use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b c MC-98316 See also: Entity format Illusioners have entity data associated with them

[JE only ] Vindicators are sometimes neutral if naturally spawned in a woodland mansion, which means that the vindicator does not attack the player on sight, but only after the player attacks it.\n\nMain article: Patrol In Java Edition, any vindicators can join a patrol if sufficiently near a patrol captain, but do not go seeking out for patrols to join.\n\nMain article: Raid Vindicators can spawn during raids.\n\nThey appear more frequently during later waves and at higher difficulties.\n\nVindicators can spawn riding ravagers, creating a vindicator ravager jockey. [JE only ] In Java Edition, if a player spawns a vindicator with a spawn egg or using a command, the vindicator has a chance of becoming an illager captain, with a Ominous banner attached above its back.\n\nA vindicator drops loot only when killed by a player or tamed wolf: 5 and an additional 1\u20133 per naturally-spawned equipment.\n\n0\u20131 emeralds when killed by the player.\n\nThe maximum increases by 1 for every level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-4 with Looting III.\n\n8.5% chance of dropping their normal or enchanted iron axe, which increases by 1% per level of Looting with random durability.\n\n1 Ominous banner (in Java Edition), or illager banner in Bedrock Edition if they spawn as a raid captain.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, if a vindicator spawns as part of a raid, it drops: 0-1 Emerald Additionally, in Bedrock Edition, vindicators have a 65% chance of dropping the following on Easy and Normal difficulties, and an 80% chance of dropping them on Hard difficulty: 0-1 Emerald (10 \u2044 39 chance) 2-3 Emerald (5 \u2044 39 chance) 4-5 Emerald (2 \u2044 39 chance) 1 Enchanted Book (2 \u2044 39 chance) 1 Iron Axe (5 \u2044 78 chance) 1 Iron Pickaxe (5 \u2044 78 chance) 1 Iron Shovel (5 \u2044 78 chance) 1 Iron Sword (5 \u2044 78 chance) 1 Iron Helmet (5 \u2044 78 chance) 1 Iron Chestplate (5 \u2044 78 chance) 1 Iron Leggings (5 \u2044 78 chance) 1 Iron Boots (5 \u2044 78 chance) Notes: Iron equipment from raid drops always has a 50% chance of being enchanted with a random enchantment at level 5-19.\n\nIron equipment from raid drops is always damaged.\n\nThese drops are also affected by the Looting enchantment.\n\nThe enchanted book has a level 30 enchantment, may be treasure enchantment.\n\nEmeralds are both a regular raid drop and an additional raid drop.\n\nWith Looting III enchantment, a vindicator has spawned from a raid can drop up to 16 emeralds upon death, but the chance is 3.328% on Easy or Normal, and 4.096% on Hard.\n\nIt is possible for a vindicator spawned from a raid to drop both its naturally-spawned iron axe and a second iron axe from its additional raid drops (in Easy and Normal difficulty 0.3536% chance, 0.3952% chance with Looting I, 0.4368% chance with Looting II, and 0.4784% chance with Looting III, while in Hard difficulty 0.4352% chance, 0.4864% chance with Looting I, 0.5376% chance with Looting II, and 0.5888% chance with Looting III).\n\nA vindicator captain chasing a Villager.\n\nVindicators are hostile toward players, iron golems, adult villagers, wandering traders, and snow golems. [BE only ] In Bedrock Edition, vindicators are passive to players on Peaceful difficulty but will still attack other mobs.\n\nWhile idle, a vindicator crosses its arms similar to a villager, with its axe stowed.\n\nWhile giving chase, the vindicator brandishes its axe and sprints.\n\nIf it has no weapons, a mainhand-unarmed vindicator raises both of its hands when attacking.\n\nOn Normal and Hard difficulties, vindicators that are part of a raid can break wooden doors.\n\nThis is controlled by the raider tag.\n\n[1] Like any illager during a raid, vindicators celebrate by cheering if all the villagers are killed or all the beds are destroyed.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, if a pillager arrow accidentally strikes a vindicator, the vindicator retaliates against the pillager, but the pillager does not retaliate.\n\nAll illagers remain friendly to each other in Java Edition, even when struck accidentally.\n\n[2] Vindicators are likely to call help from other vindicators when attacked by mobs or players (except for illagers and goats, or if they were killed in one hit), inciting them all to attack the aggressor.\n\nThey do not call help from other kinds of illagers.\n\nVindicator raiders can break doors and open doors like villagers.\n\n[needs testing ] Ringing a bell gives all vindicators within 32 blocks the Glowing effect for 3 seconds.\n\nVindicators can only sprint, even when idle.\n\nA dispenser can equip a vindicator with armor, but it is invisible and does not show on its model.\n\nArmed vindicators hit for 7.5 \u00d7 3.75 to 19.5 \u00d7 9.75 damage, depending on difficulty.\n\nThey tie with piglin brutes for dealing the third most melee damage in the game, following the iron golem at 21 \u00d7 10.5 damage and the warden at 45 \u00d7 22.5 damage.\n\nThe vindicator's axe attack disables the player's shield for 5 seconds, even when riding a ravager.\n\nA vindicator named Johnny (using a name tag, named spawn egg, etc., or has its Johnny tag set to 1b) is hostile to every mob except evokers, pillagers, other vindicators, ghasts [3] and players in Creative or Spectator mode.\n\nIn Java Edition, they also do not attack baby villagers, illusioners or armor stands [4].\n\nThis hostility extends to vexes, ravagers and witches in both editions.\n\n[5] \"Johnny\" vindicators will also attempt to attack the ender dragon, but it will not take damage.\n\nAll hostile or neutral mobs try to attack the \"Johnny\" vindicator in return, except for ender dragons, [verify ] endermites (as they die in one hit), guardians, elder guardians, phantoms, goats (apart from their usual ramming behavior), slimes, magma cubes, and ravagers.\n\nSince raid captains can instruct nearby pillagers to attack their target, naming a vindicator raid captain \"Johnny\" will cause other raiders to attack Johnny's target, even if they wouldn't usually.\n\nThis can cause witches, vexes and ravagers to target one another, and can even cause ravagers to attack themselves.\n\nIf this causes a witch to target a ravager, the witch will instead throw Splash Potions of healing, since ravagers are raid mobs.\n\nThe Johnny tag overrides its name; the player can give the vindicator any other name and set the Johnny tag to 1b and it remains hostile in the same way as described.\n\nConversely, the player can name the vindicator \" Johnny \" and set the Johnny tag to 0b, causing the vindicator to act as a normal vindicator.\n\nNaming a \"Johnny\" vindicator something else using a name tag will not set its Johnny tag to 0b, and it will continue to exhibit \"Johnny\" behavior. [Java Edition only ] Naming a vindicator spawn egg \"Johnny\" and using it on a spawner has no effect; normal vindicators spawn rather than vindicators named \"Johnny\".

Edition: Height: 1.9 Blocks Width: 0.6 Blocks Pillagers are hostile mobs armed with crossbows found in wandering patrols, in pillager outposts, or as participants in raids.\n\nThey attack by firing arrows at the player.\n\nIn Java Edition, a pillager spawned by a player using a spawn egg or commands can be a captain which has an ominous banner sticking out of its head.\n\nIn Java Edition, the number of pillagers spawning in each patrol varies from one to five and depends on the regional difficulty, with one spawning as a patrol captain.\n\nPatrols occur after 5 1 \u2044 2 in-game days, any time and independently of structures, which means they still spawn in worlds without generated structures.\n\nA patrol spawns 24 to 48 blocks away from a random player, on the highest solid block.\n\nThe individual pillagers of a patrol can spawn only at block light level less than 9, regardless of sky light.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, each patrol spawns two to five pillagers.\n\nOne of these pillagers is a patrol captain.\n\nAfter 5 1 \u2044 2 in-game days, patrols appear 24 to 48 blocks away from the player, at a light level of 7 and below on Easy or any light level on Normal and Hard difficulty.\n\nPillagers continually spawn in a 72\u00d754\u00d772 block volume centered on the top floor in a pillager outpost.\n\nSome pillagers spawn as outpost captains.\n\nThey may spawn on any valid opaque block if the block light level is less than or equal to 8.\n\nIn Java Edition, there can be unlimited pillagers that spawn in outposts naturally, limited only by the natural spawning rules.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, pillagers continually spawn at or below a particular location in the outpost, choosing the highest opaque block with a non-solid block on top and spawning on the northwest corner.\n\nA maximum of eight pillagers spawn naturally in an outpost.\n\nIn a raid, pillagers are more common in the earlier waves and decrease in number as the waves progress.\n\nDespite this, they still constitute the majority of raiders in total.\n\nOne pillager spawns riding a ravager in the fifth wave.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, one of the ravagers is ridden by a pillager instead of a vindicator on the seventh wave.\n\nIn Java Edition, pillagers spawn during bonus waves and have the largest chance of being the raid captain in the first wave, but in the second wave and onwards, vindicators have a greater chance than pillagers of being the raid captain.\n\nA pillager drops upon death: In Bedrock Edition, pillagers drop 0 - 2 arrow s.\n\nEach level of the Looting enchantment increases the maximum number of arrows dropped for up to five.\n\nThere is a 8.5% chance to drop a crossbow when killed by the player or a tamed wolf.\n\nThe crossbow may be loaded or unloaded depending on the crossbow's state when the pillager dies.\n\nThe drop chance increases by 1% per level of Looting.\n\nThe crossbow is of a random durability and has a chance of being enchanted.\n\nThe chance ranges from 0% to 10% depending on the regional difficulty.\n\nThe enchantment level is from 5 to 19.\n\n5 experience points and an additional 1\u20133 points per naturally-spawned equipment when killed by the player or a tamed wolf.\n\nIts illager ominous banner if spawned as a captain.\n\n1 Ominous Bottle which gives Bad Omen I-V if spawned as a captain.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, pillagers that were spawned by raids have a 6% chance on easy and normal or 80% chance on hard difficulties to drop these: 0\u20131 Emerald (10 \u2044 39 or 25.6%) 2\u20133 Emerald (5 \u2044 39 or 12.8%) 4\u20135 Emerald (2 \u2044 39 or 5.1%) 1 Enchanted Book (2 \u2044 39 or 5.1%) 1 Iron Pickaxe (5 \u2044 78 or 6.4%) 1 Iron Axe (5 \u2044 78 or 6.4%) 1 Iron Shovel (5 \u2044 78 or 6.4%) 1 Iron Sword (5 \u2044 78 or 6.4%) 1 Iron Helmet (5 \u2044 78 or 6.4%) 1 Iron Chestplate (5 \u2044 78 or 6.4%) 1 Iron Leggings (5 \u2044 78 or 6.4%) 1 Iron Boots (5 \u2044 78 or 6.4%) The iron equipment drops have a 50% chance to be enchanted at level 5 to 19.\n\nSaid equipment may also have enchantment combinations that cannot be normally obtained, such as Blast Protection and Fire Protection on the same pair of boots.\n\nIron equipment drops are always of 30 to 90% item durability.\n\nThese drops are affected by the Looting enchantment.\n\nEnchanted books have level 30 enchantments, which can also be treasure enchantments.\n\nSpecial loot chances of dropping Easy and normal modes Hard mode An emerald: 8.32% 10.24% 2-3 emeralds: 8.32% 10.24% 4-5 emeralds: 3.33% 4.102% An enchanted book: 3.33% 4.102% An iron equipment: 4.16% 5.12% Pillagers are hostile toward players, iron golems, wandering traders and adult villagers.\n\nPillagers also aid other pillagers attacked by other mobs.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a pillager that accidentally harms a vindicator or evoker causes it to retaliate and attack the pillager.\n\nIn Java Edition, pillagers do not retaliate on vindicators or evokers that attack them.\n\nA passive pillager holding an ominous banner in the right hand.\n\nWhen a player is in Creative mode or applied with the Invisibility effect, getting near a pillager still causes it to take notice and stare at the player.\n\nIf a pillager notices an enemy while staring at the player, the pillager stops staring and attacks the enemy.\n\nIf a player with the invisibility effect attacks a pillager, the pillager still retaliates.\n\nA pillager attacks by shooting arrows from its crossbows every three seconds from up to eight blocks away and pursues enemies for up to 64 blocks in Java Edition or 16 blocks in Bedrock Edition.\n\nPillagers move slowly when wandering or loading crossbows in Java Edition.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, pillagers move from one place to another as fast as when they're provoked, although they stop and look around, pointing their crossbows along.\n\nPillagers point their crossbows at any player or mob they are looking at, whether their crossbows are loaded or unloaded.\n\nA pillager stares at the player and points its crossbow toward the player when the player is in creative mode or when the player has the invisibility status effect.\n\nThe patrol captain wears an ominous banner, known as the illager banner in Bedrock and Education Editions, on its head.\n\nThe other illagers follow the captain around.\n\nThe pillagers that are part of a patrol do not attack immediately.\n\nThe patrol members' heads turn to follow the player or mob who attracted their attention.\n\nIf the player or villager-like mob attacks or approaches within ten blocks of the patrol members, then this provokes them into loading their crossbows and attacking.\n\n[1] If raiding pillagers kill all the villagers in a village, they celebrate their victory by jumping and laughing.\n\nUnarmed pillagers also cheer.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, pillagers wave their arms while holding their crossbows in their main hand when cheering.\n\nPillagers can take and equip illager banners within 3 blocks, but non-raider pillagers do not search for ominous banners.\n\nIn Java Edition, if a pillager gets attacked by a mob (excluding illagers and goats) or player, it will alert other pillagers to target the attacker unless the pillager was killed in one hit.\n\nPillagers can also use crossbows in their off-hand.\n\nWhen a pillager finds a target, the pillager chases the target, then locks the target in its attack range and loads its crossbow.\n\nPillagers with their crossbows loaded can attack at any blocks away if the target is out of their attack range.\n\nPillagers, unlike evokers or vindicators, attack on sight, not regarding distance, although attacking a pillager, vindicator or evoker far away causes the attacked illager and the same type of illagers around the attacked illager to attack the player regardless of distance.\n\nThe command /summon pillager ~ ~ ~ {} summons a passive pillager that does not attack.\n\nA pillager's crossbow eventually breaks with repeated use, unlike weapons wielded by other mobs.\n\n[2] Unarmed pillagers are passive toward the player, iron golems and villagers, but they still frighten villagers and iron golems are still hostile toward them.\n\nThis also includes pillagers that don't have a crossbow, which means any pillagers with a sword or any weapon other than a crossbow are still passive.\n\nAn unarmed pillager always faces any player in its field of view or any mob that attacks it.\n\nA pillager spawned with arrows or firework rockets in its off-hand slot will use them, depleting the stack over time and switching to regular arrows once running out of ammo.\n\n[3] When firing firework rockets, pillagers will aim above the target as when using arrows, despite rockets being unaffected by gravity.\n\n[4] If a pillager's arrow hits a neutral or hostile mob by accident, the mob attacks the pillager.\n\nPillagers cannot use their crossbows in their off-hand, as mobs cannot use weapons in their off-hand, just like players.\n\nThe different of the pillagers texture in Java (left) and Bedrock (right) Edition.\n\nPillagers use an outdated behavior.\n\n[5] [6] They also have different arm textures.\n\n[7] Pillagers load their crossbows upon spawning or if their crossbows are unloaded.\n\nWhen a pillager finds a target, it loads its crossbow first, chases the target and attacks upon in range.\n\nPillagers are not hostile to players before their crossbows are loaded, so sometimes they don't look at players or run around while loading their crossbows.\n\nA dispenser can equip a pillager with armor.\n\nHowever, an armor item isn't rendered on pillagers.\n\nIf a player summons a pillager without a crossbow by spawn event command, it still shoots arrows to attack targets, like other arrow-shooting ranged mobs.\n\nThis is due to the fact that in the pillager.json and ranged piglin.json files, the component_groups have both minecraft:behavior.ranged_attack and minecraft:behavior.charge_held_item, so if a pillager does not have a crossbow, the charge_held_item behavior cannot trigger and it continuously shoots arrows due to the ranged_attack behavior.\n\nUnlike in Java Edition, the crossbows of pillagers in Bedrock Edition don't break.\n\n[8] Pillagers use a melee attack while underwater, unlike pillagers in Java Edition that maintain using crossbows underwater, although the shot arrows travel slower underwater and sink after a short distance.\n\nA player receives the Bad Omen status effect by drinking an Ominous Potion.\n\nThe effect lasts for 100 minutes (five in-game days) and can be removed by drinking milk.\n\nWhen a player afflicted with Bad Omen enters a village, a raid commences in that village, bringing about waves of illagers that seek and try to kill all villagers.\n\nEach patrol spawns one pillager captain.\n\nWhile outposts can continually spawn pillager captains, each captain inflicts the player who killed it with one level of Bad Omen upon death.\n\nRaid captains do not inflict Bad Omen when defeated in a raid.\n\nIn Java Edition, killing multiple captains in succession raises the Bad Omen level to a maximum of V, increasing the chance of pillagers and vindicators in the resulting raid wielding enchanted weapons.\n\nAs long as the Bad Omen level is higher than I, the resulting raid includes an additional wave with a raider composition identical to that of the last wave.\n\nJava Edition: Pillagers use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: \u2191 Due to a typo, the third sound for pillager celebrating is unused.\n\nSee MCPE-121058.\n\nJava Edition: Bedrock Edition: Pillagers have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Tags common to all mobs spawnable in raids Inventory: Each compound tag in this list is an item in the pillager's inventory, up to a maximum of 5 slots.\n\nItems in two or more slots that can be stacked together are automatically be condensed into one slot.\n\nPillagers don't change their inventory automatically or drop items from it upon death.\n\nThe inventory is currently unused.\n\n[more information needed ] An item in the inventory, excluding the Slot tag.\n\nTags common to all items Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nThis section would benefit from the addition of more images.\n\nPlease remove this notice once you've added suitable images to the article.\n\nThe specific instructions are: Pillagers before Bedrock Edition Beta 1.9.0.2.\n\nRenders of unarmed pillagers before and after 20w29a (MC-158735) Issues relating to \"Pillager\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nAlongside crossbows, pillagers were taken from Minecraft Dungeons, even though they were added to the base game first.\n\n[9] Pillagers were added in Village & Pillage as a means to give villagers a \"true\" adversary in order to balance the new village mechanics.\n\n[10] An original design of the pillager appeared like a pirate wearing an orange vest.\n\nHowever, Mojang Studios' mob designers changed the mob's design to look more like brigandine armor.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a running pillager uses the player's running animation rather than that of other illagers.\n\nSummoning an unarmed pillager in Java Edition that is invulnerable (/summon pillager ~ ~ ~ {Invulnerable:1b}) does not cause villagers to run away from the pillager.\n\nTyping /summon pillager ~ ~ ~ minecraft:calm in Bedrock Edition cause the summoned pillager to not attack players.\n\nA pillager has a 1 \u2044 16,000 chance of dropping a crossbow enchanted with two Piercing I enchantments, a 1 \u2044 409,000 chance of dropping one with Piercing I and Multishot and a 1 \u2044 3,500,000 chance of dropping one with Piercing I, Multishot, Unbreaking III and Quick Charge I.\n\nThese probabilities were calculated with pillagers spawned from patrols or outposts, because pillagers spawned from higher levels of raids have an increased chance of dropping enchanted crossbows.\n\nAlso with maximum regional difficulty, as this affects the chance of a dropped crossbow being enchanted.\n\nA pillager armed with a crossbow, shown at

\u00d7 6 Hard: 18 \u00d7 9 Roar: 6 Details Size Height: 2.2 Blocks Width: 1.95 Blocks Speed 0.4 Knockback 0.75 Ravagers are large hostile mobs that only spawn alongside illagers in raids.\n\nThey attack players, adult villagers, wandering traders and iron golems by running at them and biting them.\n\nThey can be briefly stunned by being blocked with a shield, but after recovering they will roar, damaging and knocking away all nearby entities.\n\nRavagers spawn starting at wave 3 as part of a raid.\n\nUnridden ravagers spawn at wave 3, a ravager ridden by a pillager spawns at wave 5, and a ravager ridden by a vindicator spawns at wave 7.\n\nA ravager ridden by an evoker also spawns at wave 7.\n\nUp to 5 ravagers spawn as part of a raid.\n\nUnridden ravagers spawn at waves 3 and 5, a ravager ridden by a pillager spawns at waves 5 and 7, and a ravager ridden by an evoker spawns at wave 7.\n\nRavagers can be summoned with riders by using spawn event commands.\n\n/ summon ravager ~ ~ ~ minecraft:spawn_with_pillager_rider.\n\nUpon being killed, a ravager drops: A saddle, unaffected by Looting 20 experience orbs Ravagers, as well as piglin brutes, drop the most amount of experience orbs out of all non-boss entities.\n\nRavagers are hostile toward players, iron golems, adult villagers, and wandering traders within a 32-block radius.\n\nThey attack by ramming enemies with their head, dealing a knockback of 5 blocks.\n\nRavagers also attack by opening and closing their mouths, similar to biting their target.\n\nWhen ravagers see a villager and an iron golem together, they always prioritize villagers unless they are already attacking an iron golem.\n\nThey can also destroy certain block types by charging into them.\n\nIn Java Edition, ravagers can only break leaves and crops.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, they can break leaves, all crops, any other non-tree plants, mushrooms, and turtle eggs.\n\nHere is the complete list: Although ravagers are equipped with saddles, they cannot be ridden by the player.\n\nRavagers will only naturally appear ridden by an illager.\n\nHowever, another mob can be allowed to ride a ravager using the /ride command.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition ravagers have delayed hits hit_delay_pct: 0.5.\n\nWhen set to 0.0, ravager hits wouldn't be delayed to match Java Edition.\n\nWhen its bite attack is blocked by a shield, no damage is dealt and knockback is halved.\n\nA ravager also has a 50% chance to become stunned and unable to move or attack for 2 seconds.\n\nAfter this period, it will open its mouth and roar, dealing 6 damage and a knockback of 5 blocks to nearby entities.\n\nThe roar knocks back nearby illagers without damaging them and has no effect on other ravagers (note that vexes and witches are not treated as illagers and will take both damage and knockback).\n\nIllagers that are knocked back by a ravager's roar can still take fall damage.\n\nRavagers do not attack pillagers who shoot at them by accident, and do not attack evokers when evoker fangs accidentally hit them.\n\nWhen a vindicator riding a ravager has been named \"Johnny\" it may attack the ravager while it is riding it, but the ravager does not attack the vindicator for any reason.\n\nWhen a ravager gets shot by a mob that battles with a projectile while it is attacking the player, the ravager first attempts to kill who shot it, then goes back to attacking the player once the deed is done.\n\nAny mob that doesn't battle with projectiles requires a ravagers to roar in order to aggro on it.\n\nIn Java Edition, a ravager who gets attacked by a mob (excluding illagers or goats) or player will alert other ravagers to target the attacker unless the ravager was killed in one hit.\n\nRavagers take 75% less of knockback, but they still float in water.\n\nA ravager being ridden dismounts its rider if it moves into water two blocks deep.\n\nRiders cannot mount ravagers again after being dismounted.\n\nIn Java Edition, any ravager can join a patrol if sufficiently near a patrol captain.\n\nJava Edition: Ravagers use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition:

name for multiple snapshots and betas as Mojang listened for name suggestions from the community.\n\nIn Java Edition 19w05a and Bedrock Edition beta 1.11.0.1, illager beasts were named ravagers, although \"behemoth\" was also considered.\n\n[3] Ravagers were mainly inspired by the manticore, particularly the version from Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n[4] Ravagers have a vaguely bovine appearance, and are jokingly described as \"a spicy cow\" on the Minecraft.net page.\n\n[4] However, they cannot be milked.\n\nSeveral ravager sounds are altered versions of the sounds of other mobs: The first and third ravager death sounds (https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Ravager_death1.ogg and https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Ravager_death3.ogg) are versions of the first pillager death sound

[JE only ] Vindicators are sometimes neutral if naturally spawned in a woodland mansion, which means that the vindicator does not attack the player on sight, but only after the player attacks it.\n\nMain article: Patrol In Java Edition, any vindicators can join a patrol if sufficiently near a patrol captain, but do not go seeking out for patrols to join.\n\nMain article: Raid Vindicators can spawn during raids.\n\nThey appear more frequently during later waves and at higher difficulties.\n\nVindicators can spawn riding ravagers, creating a vindicator ravager jockey. [JE only ] In Java Edition, if a player spawns a vindicator with a spawn egg or using a command, the vindicator has a chance of becoming an illager captain, with a Ominous banner attached above its back.\n\nA vindicator drops loot only when killed by a player or tamed wolf: 5 and an additional 1\u20133 per naturally-spawned equipment.\n\n0\u20131 emeralds when killed by the player.\n\nThe maximum increases by 1 for every level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-4 with Looting III.\n\n8.5% chance of dropping their normal or enchanted iron axe, which increases by 1% per level of Looting with random durability.\n\n1 Ominous banner (in Java Edition), or illager banner in Bedrock Edition if they spawn as a raid captain.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, if a vindicator spawns as part of a raid, it drops: 0-1 Emerald Additionally, in Bedrock Edition, vindicators have a 65% chance of dropping the following on Easy and Normal difficulties, and an 80% chance of dropping them on Hard difficulty: 0-1 Emerald (10 \u2044 39 chance) 2-3 Emerald (5 \u2044 39 chance) 4-5 Emerald (2 \u2044 39 chance) 1 Enchanted Book (2 \u2044 39 chance) 1 Iron Axe (5 \u2044 78 chance) 1 Iron Pickaxe (5 \u2044 78 chance) 1 Iron Shovel (5 \u2044 78 chance) 1 Iron Sword (5 \u2044 78 chance) 1 Iron Helmet (5 \u2044 78 chance) 1 Iron Chestplate (5 \u2044 78 chance) 1 Iron Leggings (5 \u2044 78 chance) 1 Iron Boots (5 \u2044 78 chance) Notes: Iron equipment from raid drops always has a 50% chance of being enchanted with a random enchantment at level 5-19.\n\nIron equipment from raid drops is always damaged.\n\nThese drops are also affected by the Looting enchantment.\n\nThe enchanted book has a level 30 enchantment, may be treasure enchantment.\n\nEmeralds are both a regular raid drop and an additional raid drop.\n\nWith Looting III enchantment, a vindicator has spawned from a raid can drop up to 16 emeralds upon death, but the chance is 3.328% on Easy or Normal, and 4.096% on Hard.\n\nIt is possible for a vindicator spawned from a raid to drop both its naturally-spawned iron axe and a second iron axe from its additional raid drops (in Easy and Normal difficulty 0.3536% chance, 0.3952% chance with Looting I, 0.4368% chance with Looting II, and 0.4784% chance with Looting III, while in Hard difficulty 0.4352% chance, 0.4864% chance with Looting I, 0.5376% chance with Looting II, and 0.5888% chance with Looting III).\n\nA vindicator captain chasing a Villager.\n\nVindicators are hostile toward players, iron golems, adult villagers, wandering traders, and snow golems. [BE only ] In Bedrock Edition, vindicators are passive to players on Peaceful difficulty but will still attack other mobs.\n\nWhile idle, a vindicator crosses its arms similar to a villager, with its axe stowed.\n\nWhile giving chase, the vindicator brandishes its axe and sprints.\n\nIf it has no weapons, a mainhand-unarmed vindicator raises both of its hands when attacking.\n\nOn Normal and Hard difficulties, vindicators that are part of a raid can break wooden doors.\n\nThis is controlled by the raider tag.\n\n[1] Like any illager during a raid, vindicators celebrate by cheering if all the villagers are killed or all the beds are destroyed.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, if a pillager arrow accidentally strikes a vindicator, the vindicator retaliates against the pillager, but the pillager does not retaliate.\n\nAll illagers remain friendly to each other in Java Edition, even when struck accidentally.\n\n[2] Vindicators are likely to call help from other vindicators when attacked by mobs or players (except for illagers and goats, or if they were killed in one hit), inciting them all to attack the aggressor.\n\nThey do not call help from other kinds of illagers.\n\nVindicator raiders can break doors and open doors like villagers.\n\n[needs testing ] Ringing a bell gives all vindicators within 32 blocks the Glowing effect for 3 seconds.\n\nVindicators can only sprint, even when idle.\n\nA dispenser can equip a vindicator with armor, but it is invisible and does not show on its model.\n\nArmed vindicators hit for 7.5 \u00d7 3.75 to 19.5 \u00d7 9.75 damage, depending on difficulty.\n\nThey tie with piglin brutes for dealing the third most melee damage in the game, following the iron golem at 21 \u00d7 10.5 damage and the warden at 45 \u00d7 22.5 damage.\n\nThe vindicator's axe attack disables the player's shield for 5 seconds, even when riding a ravager.\n\nA vindicator named Johnny (using a name tag, named spawn egg, etc., or has its Johnny tag set to 1b) is hostile to every mob except evokers, pillagers, other vindicators, ghasts [3] and players in Creative or Spectator mode.\n\nIn Java Edition, they also do not attack baby villagers, illusioners or armor stands [4].\n\nThis hostility extends to vexes, ravagers and witches in both editions.\n\n[5] \"Johnny\" vindicators will also attempt to attack the ender dragon, but it will not take damage.\n\nAll hostile or neutral mobs try to attack the \"Johnny\" vindicator in return, except for ender dragons, [verify ] endermites (as they die in one hit), guardians, elder guardians, phantoms, goats (apart from their usual ramming behavior), slimes, magma cubes, and ravagers.\n\nSince raid captains can instruct nearby pillagers to attack their target, naming a vindicator raid captain \"Johnny\" will cause other raiders to attack Johnny's target, even if they wouldn't usually.\n\nThis can cause witches, vexes and ravagers to target one another, and can even cause ravagers to attack themselves.\n\nIf this causes a witch to target a ravager, the witch will instead throw Splash Potions of healing, since ravagers are raid mobs.\n\nThe Johnny tag overrides its name; the player can give the vindicator any other name and set the Johnny tag to 1b and it remains hostile in the same way as described.\n\nConversely, the player can name the vindicator \" Johnny \" and set the Johnny tag to 0b, causing the vindicator to act as a normal vindicator.\n\nNaming a \"Johnny\" vindicator something else using a name tag will not set its Johnny tag to 0b, and it will continue to exhibit \"Johnny\" behavior. [Java Edition only ] Naming a vindicator spawn egg \"Johnny\" and using it on a spawner has no effect; normal vindicators spawn rather than vindicators named \"Johnny\". [BE only ] Java Edition: Vindicators use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b MC-226770 \u2191 \"[MC-218122] Unused sound event: minecraft:entity.zombie.attack_iron_door - Jira\" \u2013 Mojira, March 8, 2021.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Vindicators also have entities' data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Tags common to all mobs spawnable in raids Johnny: 1 or 0 (true/false) - if true, causes the vindicator to exhibit Johnny behavior.\n\nSetting to false prevents the vindicator exhibiting Johnny behavior, even if named Johnny.\n\nOptional.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Vindicator\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe \"Johnny\" Easter egg is a reference to the movie The Shining, where a troubled man possessed by evil spirits in an isolated, haunted, labyrinthine, mansion-like hotel attacks his family with an axe, and says the iconic line \"Here's Johnny!\" while breaking a door down.\n\nAccording to the Mobestiary, while a vindicator is stronger than a zombie, it still has low intelligence, 'a little smarter than a skeleton ' (note that vindicators cannot use bows in-game).\n\nA vindicator.\n\nAn attacking vindicator.\n\nAn unarmed attacking vindicator in Java Edition.\n\nAn unarmed attacking vindicator in Bedrock Edition.\n\nAttacking (unarmed; BE) A vindicator riding a ravager.\n\nA sitting vindicator.\n\nGreen eyes vindicator attacking pose.\n\nA vindicator raid captain.\n\nA vindicator named Johnny attacking an armor stand, although they do no damage as armor stands can only be broken when quickly attacked twice.\n\nA vindicator equips an item in off-hand only by command.\n\nA few vindicators chasing some villagers during a village raid.\n\nA vindicator in the promotional artwork for the Exploration Update.\n\nVindicators in the promotional artwork for the Village and Pillage Update.\n\nA vindicator within Minecraft Dungeons.\n\nThe Mobestiary page on vindicators.\n\nA LEGO vindicator.\n\nThe texture file of vindicators.\n\n\u2191 Non-raider vindicator cannot chop down wooden doors.\n\n\u2191 Vindicators/Evokers attack Pillagers when hit by them.\n\n\u2191 MC-169556 \u2191 MCPE-51000, MC-108480 \u2191 MC-108403 \u2191 Vindicators have green eyes - Fixed Meet the Vindicator \u2013 Minecraft.net on June 20, 2017 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

    "content": "This article documents an April Fools' joke.\n\nThere is no actual Java Edition 2.0 version of Minecraft in development.\n\nMinecraft 2.0 Edition Java Edition Release date April 1, 2013 Downloads Blue [note 1] Client (.json) Server Red [note 2] Client (.json) Server Purple [note 3] Client (.json) Server Protocol version Blue: 90 Red: 91 Purple: 92 15w14a \u25ba \u25ba Super Hostile Mode.\n\nOn April 1, 2013, Mojang released a hoax announcement for Minecraft 2.0, a new game they had supposedly been working on for two years, describing how it would \"bring blocky simulation games to the next level.\" The post also contained a changelog comprised mostly of nonsensical changes, such as a new slab of TNT called the Etho slab, and the addition of coal blocks (which did not exist at the time).\n\nAlthough lacking most of the promised additions, Minecraft 2.0 was produced and distributed to select celebrity individuals [1] to showcase to the public as part of the joke.\n\nMinecraft 2.0 is a fork of 1.5.1, and is the only joke release not available through the Minecraft launcher.\n\nDespite being a joke, some features added in this version were implemented in subsequent updates.\n\nThis section needs cleanup to comply with the style guide.\n\n[discuss ] Please help improve this page.\n\nThe talk page may contain suggestions.\n\nEtho Slab The data value is 160, although a variant with ID 159 (double Etho slab) also exists.\n\nCan be crafted with 3 TNT: Much like other slabs, it can be placed on the lower or upper half of a block.\n\nIt has the same functions as a normal TNT; however, when it explodes, it spawns an anvil over entities in the explosion's range, including Players.\n\nThis and the block's name are references to EthosLab, a Minecraft YouTuber who often tries to kill players with falling anvils.\n\nTorch (Burnt-out) The data value is 161.\n\nTorches now burn out after a random amount of ticks.\n\nThey can be relit with flint and steel.\n\nBurnt-out torches were originally supposed to be added in the Halloween Update, where lanterns were supposed to be the new light source.\n\nHowever, this feature wasn't added to the Halloween Update before release and was later officially rejected.\n\nBlock of Coal The data value is 162.\n\nJust like the other mineral blocks, it is crafted with 3\u00d73 coal: However, when it is put into the crafting table to get back the coal, the coal obtained is not stackable with other coal, because it has a different item data value: 32767 instead of 0.\n\nThis is likely an intentional bug.\n\nThis block was later added into Minecraft in Java Edition 1.6.1 with the same texture as from the April Fools version, but it was later retextured.\n\nTinted Glass Has a data value of 163.\n\nIs opaque.\n\nGlass can be dyed any color that the dye exists for, and yields 8 tinted glass of the corresponding color: Contains block data values ranging from 0\u201315 that specify the color of the glass.\n\nWool's block data values produce the same colors when used on tinted glass.\n\nIn Java Edition 1.7.2, tinted glass was added to the game under the name stained glass.\n\nAt its first introduction, 13w41a, it used the 2.0 textures, but it was changed in the next snapshot, 13w42a.\n\nIn Java Edition 1.17, tinted glass was added.\n\nIt is unlikely that the identical naming of these blocks was intentional.\n\nEtho slab Torch (Burnt-out) Block of Coal Tinted Glasses The pink wither compared to the regular wither.\n\nA large swarm of redstone bugs.\n\n\"Horses\", \"Ponies\" Textures are called pig_horse, and cow_horse.\n\nThese \"horses\" and \"ponies\" can sometimes be obtained when cows or pigs are spawned with spawn eggs.\n\nThey follow a player holding an apple or sugar, but they breed like normal horses.\n\nPink wither Main article: Pink Wither Attracted to sugar, restores health to all surrounding mobs, and applies bone meal to all eligible neighboring blocks.\n\nIt also has the ability to grow roses, dandelions, grass and ferns on grass blocks, due to the bone meal.\n\nStarts off with one head.\n\nFeeding it sugar grows another head (up to three) and increase the range of these effects.\n\nPink withers are spawned by placing pink wool, with a flower pot containing a rose on top.\n\nJust like their evil counterpart, they drop nether stars.\n\nIt is still classified as a hostile mob, though its behavior is not hostile.\n\nThe pink wither is also considered undead, and is hurt by potions of Healing and healed by potions of Harming.\n\nUnlike the normal wither the pink wither can't fly and has no health bar.\n\nIn the version.jar file the texture is named wither_pink.\n\nPink withers were also seen in 15w14a, another April Fools snapshot.\n\nDiamond chickens Main article: Diamond Chicken Rarely spawns instead of a normal chicken.\n\nLays diamonds or lapis lazuli, or explodes instead of laying eggs.\n\nRedstone bug Main article: Redstone Bug Has the appearance of a silverfish, but with a shade of red that is the same as the redstone they spawned over.\n\nSame behavior as silverfish.\n\nSpawns when a redstone error is activated, on the spot of the error.\n\nDiamond Chicken Redstone Bug (silverfish) Horse (cow) Pony (pig) Pink Wither Dropper Has been renamed to floppers.\n\nChange anything they drop to a raw fish.\n\nFurnace Has a new NBT tag Heat that can reach from 0 to 700.\n\nThe tag increases every tick the furnace is lit with a 50% probability.\n\nIt decreases with a 25% probability every tick it is not lit.\n\nThe furnace has a higher chance of spawning a large smoke particle the higher the Heat tag is.\n\nWhen Heat reaches 700 the furnace has a 25% chance of exploding every tick.\n\nThe explosion has a power of 5 and creates fire.\n\nTorches Burn out over time, turning into burnt-out torches.\n\nThey can be relighted with flint and steel.\n\nChicken Are now a neutral mob, and spawn reinforcements with a 25% probability when killed.\n\nThey also attack when the player looks at them.\n\nThis can be prevented by wearing a pumpkin.\n\nThey have an attack strength of 4.\n\nPigs, Mooshrooms, Cows, Sheeps and Chickens.\n\nNew NBT tag Fatness with a default value of 0.\n\nIncreases every time they are fed with the item to breed them.\n\nThe size of body increases except for chickens.\n\nWhen the Fatness reaches 10 or higher the animal explodes without destroying any blocks.\n\nThey drop up to two times their Fatness items.\n\nSheep Using a golden apple makes them fly.\n\nZombie Pigmen Now carry \"Battle signs \".\n\nMobs \"Super Hostile Mode\" is an occasional event (every 2\u20135 minutes on Purple version).\n\nConsisting of a shower of lightning bolts around the player (and usually striking the player at least once), while spawning a large number of powerful monsters in the area and applying the Blindness status to the player.\n\nThese spawns include not only heavily armed and armored zombies and skeletons, and multiple charged creepers, but even the occasional blaze and other monsters that don't usually spawn in the Overworld.\n\nThis is a reference to Vechs' Super Hostile series of maps.\n\nAll of these are apparently triggered by \"punching wood\" or crafting anything.\n\nNaturally, these are some of the first things a Survival player needs to do.\n\nOptions There is a new option for Super HD Graphics.\n\nWhen this option is turned on, it makes all textures monochrome except for recolored/secondary layer textures, such as grass side overlay or the colored glass.\n\nSuper HD Graphics mode does not, however, make the game more laggy or glitchy.\n\nSpeech bubbles Blocks and mobs can have speech bubbles containing text above their heads, simulating talking.\n\nAll quotes: \"That hurts:(\", \"My eye!\", \"..zzZZZ\", \"Why!?\", \"I'll be back!\", \"You didn't....\", \"Oof\", \"(&%!@*#&%!@$#\", \"Ouch\", \"Hi there!\", \"That tickles\",

    "content": "This article documents an April Fools' joke.\n\nThere is no actual Java Edition 2.0 version of Minecraft in development.\n\nMinecraft 2.0 Edition Java Edition Release date April 1, 2013 Downloads Blue [note 1] Client (.json) Server Red [note 2] Client (.json) Server Purple [note 3] Client (.json) Server Protocol version Blue: 90 Red: 91 Purple: 92 15w14a \u25ba \u25ba Super Hostile Mode.\n\nOn April 1, 2013, Mojang released a hoax announcement for Minecraft 2.0, a new game they had supposedly been working on for two years, describing how it would \"bring blocky simulation games to the next level.\" The post also contained a changelog comprised mostly of nonsensical changes, such as a new slab of TNT called the Etho slab, and the addition of coal blocks (which did not exist at the time).\n\nAlthough lacking most of the promised additions, Minecraft 2.0 was produced and distributed to select celebrity individuals [1] to showcase to the public as part of the joke.\n\nMinecraft 2.0 is a fork of 1.5.1, and is the only joke release not available through the Minecraft launcher.\n\nDespite being a joke, some features added in this version were implemented in subsequent updates.\n\nThis section needs cleanup to comply with the style guide.\n\n[discuss ] Please help improve this page.\n\nThe talk page may contain suggestions.\n\nEtho Slab The data value is 160, although a variant with ID 159 (double Etho slab) also exists.\n\nCan be crafted with 3 TNT: Much like other slabs, it can be placed on the lower or upper half of a block.\n\nIt has the same functions as a normal TNT; however, when it explodes, it spawns an anvil over entities in the explosion's range, including Players.\n\nThis and the block's name are references to EthosLab, a Minecraft YouTuber who often tries to kill players with falling anvils.\n\nTorch (Burnt-out) The data value is 161.\n\nTorches now burn out after a random amount of ticks.\n\nThey can be relit with flint and steel.\n\nBurnt-out torches were originally supposed to be added in the Halloween Update, where lanterns were supposed to be the new light source.\n\nHowever, this feature wasn't added to the Halloween Update before release and was later officially rejected.\n\nBlock of Coal The data value is 162.\n\nJust like the other mineral blocks, it is crafted with 3\u00d73 coal: However, when it is put into the crafting table to get back the coal, the coal obtained is not stackable with other coal, because it has a different item data value: 32767 instead of 0.\n\nThis is likely an intentional bug.\n\nThis block was later added into Minecraft in Java Edition 1.6.1 with the same texture as from the April Fools version, but it was later retextured.\n\nTinted Glass Has a data value of 163.\n\nIs opaque.\n\nGlass can be dyed any color that the dye exists for, and yields 8 tinted glass of the corresponding color: Contains block data values ranging from 0\u201315 that specify the color of the glass.\n\nWool's block data values produce the same colors when used on tinted glass.\n\nIn Java Edition 1.7.2, tinted glass was added to the game under the name stained glass.\n\nAt its first introduction, 13w41a, it used the 2.0 textures, but it was changed in the next snapshot, 13w42a.\n\nIn Java Edition 1.17, tinted glass was added.\n\nIt is unlikely that the identical naming of these blocks was intentional.\n\nEtho slab Torch (Burnt-out) Block of Coal Tinted Glasses The pink wither compared to the regular wither.\n\nA large swarm of redstone bugs.\n\n\"Horses\", \"Ponies\" Textures are called pig_horse, and cow_horse.\n\nThese \"horses\" and \"ponies\" can sometimes be obtained when cows or pigs are spawned with spawn eggs.\n\nThey follow a player holding an apple or sugar, but they breed like normal horses.\n\nPink wither Main article: Pink Wither Attracted to sugar, restores health to all surrounding mobs, and applies bone meal to all eligible neighboring blocks.\n\nIt also has the ability to grow roses, dandelions, grass and ferns on grass blocks, due to the bone meal.\n\nStarts off with one head.\n\nFeeding it sugar grows another head (up to three) and increase the range of these effects.\n\nPink withers are spawned by placing pink wool, with a flower pot containing a rose on top.\n\nJust like their evil counterpart, they drop nether stars.\n\nIt is still classified as a hostile mob, though its behavior is not hostile.\n\nThe pink wither is also considered undead, and is hurt by potions of Healing and healed by potions of Harming.\n\nUnlike the normal wither the pink wither can't fly and has no health bar.\n\nIn the version.jar file the texture is named wither_pink.\n\nPink withers were also seen in 15w14a, another April Fools snapshot.\n\nDiamond chickens Main article: Diamond Chicken Rarely spawns instead of a normal chicken.\n\nLays diamonds or lapis lazuli, or explodes instead of laying eggs.\n\nRedstone bug Main article: Redstone Bug Has the appearance of a silverfish, but with a shade of red that is the same as the redstone they spawned over.\n\nSame behavior as silverfish.\n\nSpawns when a redstone error is activated, on the spot of the error.\n\nDiamond Chicken Redstone Bug (silverfish) Horse (cow) Pony (pig) Pink Wither Dropper Has been renamed to floppers.\n\nChange anything they drop to a raw fish.\n\nFurnace Has a new NBT tag Heat that can reach from 0 to 700.\n\nThe tag increases every tick the furnace is lit with a 50% probability.\n\nIt decreases with a 25% probability every tick it is not lit.\n\nThe furnace has a higher chance of spawning a large smoke particle the higher the Heat tag is.\n\nWhen Heat reaches 700 the furnace has a 25% chance of exploding every tick.\n\nThe explosion has a power of 5 and creates fire.\n\nTorches Burn out over time, turning into burnt-out torches.\n\nThey can be relighted with flint and steel.\n\nChicken Are now a neutral mob, and spawn reinforcements with a 25% probability when killed.\n\nThey also attack when the player looks at them.\n\nThis can be prevented by wearing a pumpkin.\n\nThey have an attack strength of 4.\n\nPigs, Mooshrooms, Cows, Sheeps and Chickens.\n\nNew NBT tag Fatness with a default value of 0.\n\nIncreases every time they are fed with the item to breed them.\n\nThe size of body increases except for chickens.\n\nWhen the Fatness reaches 10 or higher the animal explodes without destroying any blocks.\n\nThey drop up to two times their Fatness items.\n\nSheep Using a golden apple makes them fly.\n\nZombie Pigmen Now carry \"Battle signs \".\n\nMobs \"Super Hostile Mode\" is an occasional event (every 2\u20135 minutes on Purple version).\n\nConsisting of a shower of lightning bolts around the player (and usually striking the player at least once), while spawning a large number of powerful monsters in the area and applying the Blindness status to the player.\n\nThese spawns include not only heavily armed and armored zombies and skeletons, and multiple charged creepers, but even the occasional blaze and other monsters that don't usually spawn in the Overworld.\n\nThis is a reference to Vechs' Super Hostile series of maps.\n\nAll of these are apparently triggered by \"punching wood\" or crafting anything.\n\nNaturally, these are some of the first things a Survival player needs to do.\n\nOptions There is a new option for Super HD Graphics.\n\nWhen this option is turned on, it makes all textures monochrome except for recolored/secondary layer textures, such as grass side overlay or the colored glass.\n\nSuper HD Graphics mode does not, however, make the game more laggy or glitchy.\n\nSpeech bubbles Blocks and mobs can have speech bubbles containing text above their heads, simulating talking.\n\nAll quotes: \"That hurts:(\", \"My eye!\", \"..zzZZZ\", \"Why!?\", \"I'll be back!\", \"You didn't....\", \"Oof\", \"(&%!@*#&%!@$#\", \"Ouch\", \"Hi there!\", \"That tickles\", \"Who's there!\", \"I thought we were friends\", \"You're mean!\", \"Whiiii\", \"Not dropping anything!\", \"I like you!\", \"I HATE you!\", \"YOU NO TAKE..\n\nCOBBLE!\", \"I'm diamond\", \"You punched me\", \"Stop punching me\", \"I'm dirt\", \"Mummy?\", \"SSSSSSST\", \"KABOOM?\", \"BULLY!\", \"I'm telling\", \"Creeper behind you!\", \"Did I do bad?\", and \"Hello\".\n\nAn overfed

He does not like being called a pet or mascot, as seen in Episode 1.\n\nReuben died from injuries obtained by falling from a great height.\n\nAfter retrieving Jesse's enchanted weapon, he fell into a pit inside the wither storm, later landing on the stone below missing the body of water nearby.\n\nThe name \"Reuben\" is a reference to real food: pork loin reuben similar to how Benedict's name is a reference to eggs benedict and Waffles' name is a reference to chicken and waffles.\n\nReuben somewhat resembles the Gloucestershire Old Spot, which is a breed of pigs, with a dark patch on the lower back and known for its intelligence.\n\nIn \" The Order of the Stone \", if Jesse chooses to do nothing while talking to Otis, Reuben will beat him up.\n\nHe would also appear angry in Ivor's hideout at EnderCon.\n\nIn \" Assembly Required \", if Jesse decides to go to Boom Town, they can choose pink wool as a building material (insisted by Reuben) in the Death Bowl.\n\nThis will result in them building a statue of Reuben.\n\nIf Jesse doesn't pick a name, Axel will step in, calling Jesse the Pig Master.\n\nIt appears to be a reference to Reuben himself.\n\nIn \" The Last Place You Look \", if Jesse chooses to rescue the Order\u2019s Amulet instead of helping Reuben and Axel, the option to high five Reuben will be unavailable, and Reuben will glare at Jesse before walking away.\n\nHe is later seen with Lukas.\n\nIn \" The Last Place You Look \", if Jesse talks to Reuben enough times while in Soren's research lab in The End, Reuben will tell them a joke.\n\nThis will result in the \"That's Some Pig\" achievement to be unlocked.\n\nIn \" The Last Place You Look \", when Jesse was constructing the Formidi-Bomb, Jesse's Gang, Soren, Magnus, and Ellegaard could be seen in the background building a statue of Reuben with sunglasses to distract the Wither Storm.\n\nDepending on the player's choice, Reuben's expression will be different at the end of \" The Last Place You Look \".\n\nThe three expressions will be worried, indifferent or angry.\n\nIn \" A Block and a Hard Place \", it was revealed that Reuben was initially found by Jesse near a waterfall.\n\nIn \" A Block and a Hard Place \", if Jesse chooses to craft a Hoe, Reuben will laugh at them.\n\nIn \" A Block and a Hard Place \", if Jesse doesn't choose anything when picking how to get into the Wither Storm, Olivia or Petra will suggest they build a Reuben Minecart Launcher.\n\nListening carefully, pig noises can be heard every time Jesse lays down a pink wool block.\n\nIn \" A Block and a Hard Place \", when Reuben dies, there will be a gray box on the top left corner saying \"Reuben will be remembered\".\n\nIt can also be seen in Jesse's speech.\n\nWhen Jesse asks what really mattered, they have the option to say \"Reuben\" (if you didn't say you had Reuben) and it will say \"Reuben will be remembered\" again.\n\nReuben can be mentioned in every episode except \" Jailhouse Block \" and \" Below the Bedrock \".\n\nIn \" Order Up!\n\n\", Jesse, Petra, and Lukas visit the Order Hall and see Reuben's porkchop, remembering him.\n\nJesse later sees pigs in the Sky City dimension and has the option to say that they miss Reuben.\n\nIn \" A Portal to Mystery \" Jesse has the option to insult the White Pumpkin saying, \"Cats suck!\n\nPigs are way cooler!\", which refers to Reuben.\n\nIn \" Access Denied \", after chipping Petra and Lukas, PAMA mentions Reuben by saying \"An adorable pig friend\".\n\nLater, either Lukas or Petra will mention Reuben while under PAMA's control, reminding Jesse of Reuben's death to bruise their morale.\n\nIn \" A Journey's End?\n\n\", Reuben can be mentioned by either Axel or Reuben the Endercon usher when the latter is revealed.\n\nIn \" Hero in Residence \", Reuben is mentioned in Lukas' story.\n\nJesse can visit Reuben's Memorial in Beacontown, and Reuben is also mentioned by Stella.\n\nIn \" Giant Consequences \", the Prismarine Colossus form of Romeo destroys Reuben's memorial during the fight.\n\nJesse can later rebuild the memorial.\n\nIn \" Below the Bedrock \", based on Jesse\u2019s reaction to first seeing PorkChop\u2019s (Human) hat, which resembled the head of a pig, it\u2019s likely Jesse mistook the hat for Reuben.\n\nIn \" Above and Beyond \", Jesse can visit rebuilt Reuben's memorial one more time.\n\nReuben is the only member of Jesse's Gang who has truly died.\n\nThis makes him the only member of Jesse's Gang not to appear in Season 2 Reuben is a special Minecraft: Story Mode mob in age along with Lluna, as Eric confirmed Reuben is a teenage pig.\n\n[1] \u2191 \"Yeah Lluna and Reuben are both \u201cteenage\u201d versions of animals that Mojang let us cook up special - bigger than babies, smaller than adults, with tweaked proportions and faces for maximum cuteness/sassiness/etc.\" \u2013 Stirpicus, September 26, 2017, Tumblr",

the associated color of the End and corruption.\n\nIt also has visual similarities to heart of ender from Minecraft Dungeons which was created after Minecraft: Story Mode.\n\nAt the end of \"The Last Place You Look\", the wither storm was split into three separate entities.\n\nThey all had only one head, but later in \"A Block and a Hard Place\" each of them grew two more heads.\n\nTwo of them were quite smaller than the main larger one who also had the command block within.\n\nThe wither storm is a very powerful creature.\n\nIt gained its extraordinary capabilities with the help of the Command Block.\n\nIts powers were: Wither Skulls: In its first form, the wither storm is able to shoot wither skulls the same way the ordinary wither does.\n\nSuction: In its first form, the wither storm is able to suck only objects while it didn't had its tractor beam.\n\nFlaming Wither Skulls: The wither storm in its final form was able to shoot a stronger, flaming variation of the wither skulls that the wither and itself used to shoot, their explosions are bigger and leave fire behind.\n\nTractor Beam: The wither storm was able to a create a tractor beam from each of it's head's eyes, Wither Sickness: The wither storm had an enhanced and more deadly variation of the wither (effect) that the ordinary wither has, The enhanced wither effect was called wither sickness.\n\nIt is believed that one of the ways of being infected is being too long in the creature's tractor beam.\n\nTentacles: The wither storm has several long tentacles that it uses to attack, capture preys and to destroy blocks around to help it get to its destinations.\n\nThese tentacles were strong enough to destroy even Obsidian.\n\nDurabilty: The wither storm had an absurd durability as it was able to survive the formidi-bomb even when it was exploded into pieces due to the command block withstanding it and getting the wither storm to wake up after a while.\n\nRegeneration: All the wither storm's wounds could be easily Regenerated by absorbing objects and creatures.\n\nSplitting: After the wither storm survived the formidi-bomb, it was able to make its three separated parts gain life on their own.\n\nThe bigger main one was the one who had the command block within, after it was killed with the command block 's destruction, the other two parts also died.\n\nLimbs' generation: The wither storm has the ability to grow tentacles and additional heads during its transformation while absorbing blocks and growing larger.\n\nIn \"A Block and a Hard Place\" it is shown that the wither storm is able to grow them even inside its own body so it can protect the Command Block.\n\nOrder of the Stone's Amulet's Tracking: The wither storm is able to track the Order's amulet as long it is not in the Nether or in the End.\n\nThe list below shows the victims the wither storm has killed: Magnus the Rogue (Determinant).\n\nEllegaard the Redstone Engineer (Determinant).\n\nReuben (Indirectly and Self Sacrifice).\n\nSeveral hostile mobs.\n\nPossibly a few humans (Indirectly).\n\nUsher Killed By: Jesse Reuben (assisted) The wither storm was powered by the Command Block, so to defeat it, Jesse used an enchanted weapon (with Command Block powers) to destroy the Command Block.\n\nReuben helped by retrieving the enchanted weapon for Jesse and bringing it to them, though endangering himself in the process.\n\nThis defeated the wither storm and assured it would never reanimate back to life.\n\nThe wither storm is the first major antagonist in the series and the first antagonist to be created by a person.\n\nThe second antagonist created by a person is PAMA.\n\nAlthough it's possible PAMA was the first one to be created chronologically.\n\nIt is also the first non-human major antagonist, the second being PAMA.\n\nInside the wither storm can be found withered citizens, some of them being named characters.\n\nThey are Jens, Lydia, Otis, Owen, Schoolboy, and Reuben (human).\n\nThe wither storm cannot be built in normal Minecraft, though all of the materials needed to build one exist.\n\nThe terms \"wither storm\" and \"witherstorm\" are interchangeable; in fact, both terms were used to refer to it in Minecraft: Story Mode.\n\nThe former was used in episodes 1 and 2, and the latter was used in episodes 3, 4, and 5.\n\nWhen the wither storm's middle head mutated, its eye color changed to cyan, in contrast to its main color, purple.\n\nInterestingly, at the end of episode 1 the wither storm is seen floating in the sky as if it was a light object in water.\n\nIn \"Hero in Residence\", several posters of the wither storm are seen throughout Beacontown.\n\nThe wither storm is the first antagonist to have an antagonistic role for more than one episode, the other being Romeo.\n\nIt is also the first main antagonist with no dialogue.\n\nThe wither storm after the Formidi-Bomb is used on it.",

[JE only ] Creepers flee from ocelots and cats within a 6-block radius, with faster movement than when pursuing a player.\n\nCats and ocelots do not attack creepers.\n\nA creeper that has begun a detonation does not flee unless the player leaves its blast radius.\n\nCreepers are not targeted by tamed wolves, iron golems or zoglins.\n\nHowever, they are still attacked by withers, snow golems, [2] vindicators named \"Johnny\", wardens and goats.\n\nWhen hit by a stray projectile (like a drowned 's trident), a creeper retaliates if not already chasing a player, unless said projectile is a skeleton's arrow.\n\nWhen attacked by a goat, or poisoned by a pufferfish, a creeper does not retaliate.\n\nIf a creeper is attacked by any other mob, the creeper moves toward the mob that attacked it and explodes.\n\nWhen a creeper is inflicted with a status effect, its explosion creates an area effect cloud of the effect. [JE only ] Two creepers' explosion damage radius in the dirt.\n\nComparison between a charged creeper's (left) and a normal creeper's (right).\n\nNotice that the charged creeper's explosion is much bigger than the normal creeper's explosion.\n\nA charged creeper has a significantly increased explosion power.\n\nA charged creeper is created only when lightning strikes within four blocks of a normal creeper.\n\nThe lightning can be created in any way, including naturally, with the / summon command, by a trident with the Channeling enchantment, or attracted to a lightning rod.\n\nCharged creepers are distinguished from normal creepers by the blue aura surrounding them.\n\nIn Java Edition, a charged creeper can be summoned with the following command: /summon creeper ~ ~ ~ {powered:1} In Bedrock Edition, a charged creeper can be summoned by: /summon creeper ~ ~ ~ minecraft:become_charged Their countdown timers are the same as normal creepers, both in terms of range and time.\n\nWith a power of 6, an explosion caused by a charged creeper is twice as powerful as the explosion caused by a creeper.\n\nCharged creepers' explosions are 50% more powerful than an explosion of TNT.\n\nHow close the creeper was to the lightning strike does not affect the size or power of the explosion.\n\nCharged creepers have the same entity ID as normal creepers.\n\nThe only difference is that the value of the boolean powered tag is set to 1 (true).\n\nIn Java Edition, a charged creeper explosion that kills zombies, skeletons, wither skeletons, piglins, or other creepers causes one [3] of those mobs to drop its corresponding mob head.\n\nIf multiple valid mobs are killed in the explosion, the one that drops a head is chosen at random.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a charged creeper explosion that kills zombies, skeletons, wither skeletons, or other creepers causes all the killed mobs to drop their corresponding heads.\n\nA charged creeper does not drop its own head when it explodes, although any other charged creepers or creepers killed in the explosion drop a creeper head.\n\nPlayers and ender dragons do not drop their heads, [4] nor do mobs without corresponding mob heads, such as livestock animals.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Java Edition.\n\nTo disable creeper explosions while still allowing mob griefing (e.g.\n\nfor villager farms), run the following

leaves or similar.\n\nI'm not sure why they explode.\" [9] When asked to describe its physical texture, he said they would feel \"crunchy, like dry leaves.\".\n\n[10] This can also be interpreted from the fact that the original texture for creepers is the same as an old texture of leaves.\n\nCreepers are bright green color to camouflage them for the original classic Minecraft foliage textures, which were bright shades of green, but has since been changed.\n\nIn multiplayer, if a creeper is attacked by another player, and the other player runs out of sight, it does not attack any other players.\n\nWhen asked how creepers trigger their explosive nature, Dinnerbone said \"They're so nervous that they shake a lot, and then this sets them off the same way as how rubbing two sticks makes fire\".\n\n[11] If a charged creeper is given Invisibility, the \"aura\" effect is still visible.\n\nA charged creeper explosion can inflict the greatest amount of damage any mob in the game can do at one time.\n\nThe creeper hiss sound uses the same sound file as when a block of TNT is primed but played at a lower pitch.\n\nCreepers have a formidable reputation in the community because of their potential to hurt or kill even veteran players and destroy structures.\n\nTheir distinct appearance and destructive abilities have made them a widely recognizable Minecraft icon.\n\nCreepers are referenced in several of the items available at the Minecraft merchandise depot, [12] and have become an internet meme complete with fan art, webcomic references, and demotivational posters.\n\nA central part of the meme is the creeper's unofficial catchphrase derived from the mob's tendency to sneak up on the player and hiss before detonating: \" That'sssss a very nice <random valuable object> you've got there...\n\nIt'd be a ssssshame if anything were to happen to it...\n\n\" [13] Moe Szyslak took the appearance of a creeper and exploded in the Simpsons\u2019 home within the 17th episode of season 25.\n\nCreepers have been portrayed in many Minecraft products including but not limited to: The letter \"A\" in the Minecraft logo after Java Edition Beta 1.4 (The previous logo was

ThunderLolcats they use the catchphrase, saying \"That'ssss..\n\na nice wall you've got there.\" Console/PC games In Borderlands 2, the creeper appears in groups within a mineshaft in the most north-west part of Caustic Caverns, including dirt, coal ore, stone, gold ore, and a \"Badass creeper\" that is twice the strength and size of a regular creeper.\n\nIn Airmech, creepers appear as a

[Bedrock Edition only ] Any picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping, and drops without changing the damage that has accumulated on it.\n\nIf a drowned is able to pick up equipment and is wielding a trident, it can trade its trident for a nautilus shell if it is not currently attacking anything.\n\n[Bedrock Edition only ] Java Edition For naturally-spawned drowned: Main hand (mutually exclusive): 6.25% spawn with a trident.\n\nMay be enchanted.\n\n3.75% spawn with a fishing rod.\n\nMay be enchanted.\n\nOffhand: 3% spawn with a nautilus shell in their offhand.\n\nOnly 6.25% (or 1 in 16) drowned spawn with tridents.\n\nOf these, they have an 8.5% chance to drop their trident when killed by a player.\n\nThe chance is increased by 1% for each level of looting up to a max of 11.5% with Looting III.\n\nThis means the overall chance of obtaining a trident from any given drowned is 0.53125% (about 1 in 188) or 0.71875% with looting III.\n\nNautilus shells always drop.\n\nConverted drowned are never equipped with any items.\n\nBedrock Edition For naturally-spawned drowned: Main hand (mutually exclusive): 15% spawn with a trident.\n\n0.85% spawn with a fishing rod.\n\nOffhand: 8% spawn with a nautilus shell in the offhand.\n\nOnly 15% (or 3 in 20) drowned spawn with tridents.\n\nOf these, they have a 25% chance to drop their trident when killed by a player.\n\nThis chance is increased by 4% for each level of looting up to a max of 37% with looting III.\n\nThis means the overall chance of obtaining a trident from any given drowned is 3.75% (or 3 in 80) or 5.55% with looting III.\n\nFor converted drowned: 1% spawn with a fishing rod in the main hand.\n\n8% spawn with a nautilus shell in the offhand (same as naturally spawned drowned).\n\nConverted drowned are never equipped with tridents.\n\nOn Halloween, zombies may spawn wearing a carved pumpkin or jack o'lantern [Java Edition only ].\n\nThey do not drop this, even when killed with Looting.\n\nMain article: Tutorials/Drowned farming Farms that convert zombies into drowned produce all of naturally-spawned equipment dropped by zombies, as well as fishing rods, copper ingots, and (in Bedrock Edition) nautilus shells.\n\nA drowned farm must be designed to harvest naturally-spawned drowned to produce tridents in all game editions and nautilus shells in Java Edition.\n\nA drowned swimming in Java Edition.\n\nDrowned have a melee attack, and if they spawn with a trident, they use it as a ranged weapon.\n\nA trident is thrown every 1.5 seconds at up to 20 blocks away.\n\nThrown tridents cannot be picked up by the player for the same reason skeleton-shot arrows cannot be picked up by the player.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, drowned with tridents use a melee attack if the target is 3 blocks away or less.\n\nThey are always hostile toward axolotls, and like other zombie variants, they chase and attack villagers, wandering traders, snow golems, [BE only ] baby turtles and iron golems at night or in dark areas.\n\nDrowned detect turtle eggs within 10 blocks in Bedrock Edition and 24 blocks in Java Edition.\n\nThey stomp on turtle eggs until the eggs break.\n\nDrowned can even jump over a 1-block gap to reach a turtle egg successfully, even if the egg is raised 1 block higher than the gap.\n\nIf on land, drowned seek out nearby water.\n\nThey sometimes step onto land but quickly return to the water.\n\nDuring the day, drowned swim only to attack players that are in any water; otherwise, they stay on the floor of the water body they are in, ignoring players on land, in a boat or that have attacked them or other drowned.\n\nDrowned equipped with tridents continue throwing them at the player even after the player leaves the water, or gets a long distance away.\n\n[1] They also attack players if they attack them or another drowned, unless the drowned is killed in one hit.\n\n[2]  [JE only ] Additionally, they may not always immediately become aggressive toward a player when they first enter water.\n\nAt night or during thunderstorms, drowned swim to the surface and chase players as well as baby turtles, even outside the water, like regular zombies.\n\nIf a drowned kills a villager, either with a melee attack or with a trident, the villager has a chance of turning into a zombie villager (with a 0% chance on Easy, 50% on Normal, and 100% on Hard).\n\nDrowned break down wooden doors in Hard mode. [BE only ] They are immune to guardians or elder guardians attacks.\n\nThey also have a small chance to be immune to knockback when damaged.\n\n[3] Some drowned spawn with the ability to pick up loot that is on the ground.\n\nThat includes armor and weapons or tools just like regular zombies.\n\nUnlike zombies however, they can also pick up tridents, which they always prefer over anything else.\n\nThey also can pick it up and throw it the wrong way.\n\nDrowned can be damaged by a fully-powered conduit within 8 blocks.\n\nIf one drowned gets attacked by another drowned's trident, the attacked drowned ignores it.\n\nA drowned swimming in Bedrock Edition.\n\nA drowned in a river.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition.\n\nDrowned use a swimming animation similar to the player.\n\nThey use this animation whenever they try to pathfind to a player that is either below or above them; if the player is on the same ground level, the drowned simply walk toward them.\n\nDrowned also use this animation if they are tracking a player while they are not standing on a solid block.\n\nTheir hitbox does not change when using this animation.\n\nAlso, if they hold a nautilus shell or anything else in their offhand, their arms are in the same posture as a player's.\n\nWhen attacking, they use the player's attacking animation.\n\nStill, they use the same swimming animation when tracking a player underwater.\n\nIn Java Edition a Trident enchanted with Impaling does not do extra damage to Drowned because they're classified as undead and not aquatic.\n\nThis does not apply in Bedrock Edition as instead a Trident enchanted with Impaling does extra damage to any mob in water or rain.\n\nJava Edition: Drowned use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b MC-177110 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 a b This variable is block-dependent, and varies depending upon the block \u2191 Depends on the drowned's velocity, around 0.003 when moving around underwater with no target.\n\nThe precise equation is the smaller of 1.0 or 0.35\u00d7(the momentum of the drowned, with the horizontal axes multiplied by 0.2) Bedrock Edition: \u2191 a b c MCPE-53297 Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Drowned have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Tags common to all zombies Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nThis page would benefit from the addition of more images.\n\nPlease remove this notice once you've added suitable images to the article.\n\nThe specific instructions are: Render of drowned in Bedrock Edition.\n\nIssues relating to \"Drowned\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nDrowned are not considered as aquatic mobs; instead, they are considered as undead, unaffected by Impaling enchantment.\n\n[7]  [Java Edition only ] A drowned chicken jockey floats to the surface because the chicken it is riding floats, causing the drowned riding it to burn in sunlight during the day, resulting in a chicken in the middle of the ocean or river where the drowned jockey spawned in. [Java Edition only ] In Bedrock Edition, drowned have a 3D outer layer.\n\nThis causes their heads and arms to look larger than in Java Edition and causes rendering conflicts with armor, particularly helmets.\n\nLike spiders and endermen, drowned have eyes that appear to glow, although they do not produce light.\n\nAn unreleased drowned texture.\n\nThree drowned mobs that spawned naturally in an ocean biome.\n\nA group of drowned attacking the player.\n\nDrowned within a coral reef.\n\nA drowned attacking a pufferfish after being attacked by it.\n\nDrowned can sometimes spawn in ocean ruins in positions that they can't get out of.\n\nA drowned wearing armor.\n\nThis occurs only on drowned zombies, not naturally spawned drowned.

    "content": "\"Dragon\" redirects here.\n\nFor the mentioned feature, see Red Dragon.\n\nFor the rendering engine, see RenderDragon.\n\nFor other uses, see Dragon (disambiguation).\n\nEnder Dragon Health 200 \u00d7 100 Classification Animal Behavior Hostile Spawn The End Damage Melee: Peaceful: 0 (but still performs attack animation) Easy: 6 Normal: 10 Hard: 15 \u00d7 7.5 Wings: Easy: 3 Normal: 5 Hard: 7 Dragon's Breath: 3 per second Dragon Fireball: 6 per second Details Size Height: 8 Blocks Width: 16 Blocks Length: 16 Blocks The ender dragon is a giant flying hostile boss mob found when first entering the End.\n\nShe is the largest naturally spawning mob in the game.\n\nShe guards access to the end gateways that provide entry to the outer end islands in addition to the exit portal that allows return to the Overworld as well as access to the end credits of Minecraft.\n\nBecause of this, she is known by most Minecraft fans as the 'final boss' of the game.\n\nHer attacks involve charging at the player and her unique dragon acid attacks.\n\nThe ender dragon spawns 20 game ticks (1 second) after an entity first arrives in the End, along with the bedrock frame for the exit portal.\n\nThis image shows how the player can arrange end crystals to respawn the ender dragon.\n\nPlayers can re-summon the dragon by placing four end crystals on the edges of the exit portal, one on each side.\n\nWhen it is re-summoned, the four end crystals point to the tops of each pillar setting off a series of explosions that resets the obsidian pillars, iron bars, and end crystals.\n\nThe top of each pillar explodes, destroying any player-placed blocks.\n\nEventually, all of the end crystals point at the coordinates of (0.0, 128, 0.0) and the ender dragon spawns there.\n\nThe four crystals placed around the exit portal then explode.\n\nIf the player does not pick up the dragon egg and starts to re-summon the dragon, the dragon egg disappears.\n\nIf the dragon goes through an end gateway, another immediately spawns at (0, 128, 0) while the other dragon flies to (0, 128, 0).\n\nAfter the ender dragon is slain for the first time, the following events take place: She slowly ascends, her wings and body becoming more tattered until she disappears in beams of light erupting from her center.\n\nThere's an explosion of 12000 experience points (ten drops of 960 and one drop of 2400) \u2014 enough to bring a player from level 0 to level 68.\n\nIf killed on top of the bedrock structure, some of the experience orbs can drop into the exit portal.\n\nThe experience orbs can then be retrieved in the overworld.\n\nThe bedrock structure fills in with an end portal interface to become the exit portal, enabling the player to transport back to the Overworld and respawn at their spawn point.\n\nA dragon egg appears above the island's central bedrock structure.\n\nIf a block exists right above the center of the central bedrock structure, then the dragon egg spawns 1 block above the highest block at (0,0).\n\nIf the highest block is at the height limit, then the dragon egg does not spawn.\n\nAn end gateway portal is generated floating within 75\u2013100 blocks of the exit portal.\n\nWhen a re-summoned ender dragon is slain, the same events occur except that only 500 experience points are dropped [Java Edition only ] and no more than 20 gateway portals are generated.\n\nThe dragon egg appears the first time the ender dragon is slain in Java Edition, and the first and second time in Bedrock Edition; it does not appear after any subsequent dragon slaying.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Defeating the ender dragon During the battle with the ender dragon, unique music called \" Boss \" plays, the edges of the screen darkens and black fog appears, and chunks around the exit portal are constantly loaded regardless of render distance.\n\nThese happen as long as there is at least one player within a Euclidean distance of 192 blocks from (0.0, 128, 0.0).\n\nThe ender dragon has a light purple health bar that appears at the top of the player 's screen.\n\nHer health is frequently restored by nearby end crystals, indicated by a magical white beam connecting the dragon and the crystal.\n\nDestroying an end crystal that is actively healing the dragon causes 10 damage to her.\n\nThe dragon can take damage only from explosions and player-based damage, and takes damage of (1 \u2044 4 \u00d7 normal damage + 1) when hit on any part that is not her head, making it the most resilient mob in the game.\n\nSuffocation is completely non-applicable, as she either phases through or immediately destroys any block she touches.\n\nThe dragon is immune to all status effects.\n\nThe green hitboxes of the ender Dragon.\n\nBy using the F3 + B shortcut, the dragon's bounding box appears. [Java Edition only ] She cannot be damaged at just any spot in this large volume: eight green sub- hitboxes are also shown, which indicate the locations where the dragon can take damage: The tail, body, head, and wings.\n\nThe ender dragon is a flying mob, which cannot actually stand on the ground.\n\nShe flies around the end main island while fighting the player.\n\nThe dragon can pass through all blocks, destroying almost all types, but can still be affected by flowing water, lava and bubble column.\n\nBlocks not destroyed are those that naturally generate on the central End island and those that are intended to be indestructible, such as end stone and respawn anchors: Barrier Bedrock Command Block Crying Obsidian End stone End portal (block) End portal frame End gateway (block) Fire Iron bars Light Block Obsidian Reinforced Deepslate Respawn Anchor Structure Block In Java Edition, these blocks are marked under the dragon_immune tag, with the exception of light blocks and fire, which are marked as dragon_transparent.\n\nDestroyed blocks are not dropped, although containers (such as chests and dispensers, but not shulker boxes) drop their contents.\n\nThe dragon \"bathing\" endermen with its toxic breath attack.\n\nThe dragon never targets any entity but the player, although other mobs may turn hostile to the dragon when hit, and the dragon may sometimes retaliate against other mobs if it takes damage to a projectile.\n\nAny entities hit by her wings are dealt 5 damage (or 10 damage if hit by her head), and in Java Edition, are thrown into the air, sometimes to fatal heights or even off the island.\n\nNeither of these effects is applied for 1 \u2044 2 second after the dragon takes damage.\n\nThe ender dragon has four main states of behavior: Guarding The dragon begins in this state, circling the ring of obsidian pillars on either the outside if there are still end crystals or the inside if the crystals are destroyed.\n\nWith each crystal's destruction, she takes damage and there is an increased chance of the dragon switching states.\n\nTargeting Whenever the dragon finds herself less than 10 blocks or more than 150 blocks from her current target, she attempts to choose a new target.\n\nWhen damaged she targets a point just behind herself, causing her to turn away and choose a new target.\n\nStrafing Upon the destruction of an end crystal, the dragon switches to strafing.\n\nAs soon as it is within 64 blocks, she shoots a fireball at the player.\n\nThe dragon resumes circling after this state.\n\nDiving The dragon dives onto the target player's position, taken at the start of the dive.\n\nThe dragon resumes circling after this state, whether or not she actually hit the player.\n\nPerching While Guarding and the dragon has reached the end of the path, she has 1 in (3 + crystals alive) chance (~7.7% up to 33%) to go to the exit portal structure (approaching from the side opposite the player if possible) and lands on the highest block of the coordinates (x=0, z=0), up to (y=101). [Bedrock Edition only ] If there is no block in (x=0, z=0) the dragon freezes right when she switches to perching. [Bedrock Edition only ] The dragon is immune to arrows in this state; they all catch fire and bounce off.\n\nIn Java Edition she is also immune to thrown tridents in this state.\n\nDragon's Breath Unless the player is in Peaceful difficulty, after 1.25 seconds, if a player is within 20 blocks of the exit portal structure, the dragon roars and use its 3-second breath attack, damaging players similarly to a lingering potion of Harming.\n\nAn area of visible particles in the shape of a horizontal disc one block tall and 5 to 6 blocks in diameter appears where the breath attack strikes, either on the ground or floating in the air, at whatever point the breath attack struck a block.\n\nThe harming effect zone where the player takes damage is confined to a smaller area in the center this visible cloud, covering about 3 to 4 blocks.\n\nThe harming effect portion of the purple clouds emitted from the dragon's breath attack can be collected in a glass bottle to obtain dragon's breath.\n\nEach bottle of dragon's breath collected removes one block from the lingering damage zone of the breath attack.\n\nThe visible clouds remain for 3 seconds whether the dragons breath is bottled or not.\n\nBy rapidly collecting all of the harmful blocks, usually around three, even a direct hit from the breath attack can be mostly and even entirely negated before the player suffers any damage.\n\nCharge If the player is not near the portal within 5 seconds of the dragon's landing, it charges at players within 150 blocks.\n\nTake-off After four consecutive breath attacks, or if the dragon fails to locate a player within 150 blocks, she takes off from her perch.\n\nShe always takes off in Peaceful difficulty, making it difficult to land melee hits.\n\nThe dragon resumes circling after this state.\n\nEscape If cumulative damage taken while perched exceeds 50 \u00d7 25, the dragon takes off and resets the damage accumulator.\n\nThe accumulator is not reset if she does not take enough damage.\n\nThe dragon resumes circling after this state.\n\nIn Java Edition, when the dragon finally takes a fatal blow, she flies toward the exit portal structure before dying, unless she cannot find it within 150 blocks, or it is inside blocks.\n\nDragon Fireball Dragon Fireball (JE) Dragon Fireball (BE) Behavior Does not exist Details Size Height: 1 Block Width: 1 Block Dragon fireballs are special fireballs that the ender dragon fires while strafing.\n\nThey cannot be deflected unlike ghast fireballs, and they do no impact damage.\n\nInstead, they deposit purple effect clouds across the ground that damages players the same way a lingering potion of Harming does.\n\nThis means that the ender dragon's fireballs deal magic damage, which ignores any damage reduction that comes from the player's armor.\n\nHowever its damage does get reduced by armor enchanted with the Protection enchantment.\n\nThe purple effect cloud's hitbox slowly grows larger in diameter until it disappears.\n\nAs with her close-ranged breath attack, the purple clouds can be bottled to obtain the dragon's breath.\n\nUnlike lingering potions of Harming, the effect cloud does not shrink when affecting mobs.\n\nJava Edition: Ender dragons use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nDragon fireballs use the Friendly Creatures sound category for

<selector> {DragonPhase:0} commands) starts the ender dragon's ordinary behavior, although the health bar does not appear because it is managed by the ender dragon fight status rather than by the dragon entity itself  [JE only ].\n\nIf spawned away from the center of the map (x=0, z=0), it flies to the center then resumes normal behavior (see #Behavior).\n\nTarget selectors for the ender dragon target a total of 9 entities per dragon, as the ender dragon actually consists of 9 entities internally [Java Edition only ].\n\nSo executing at a dragon to summon an arrow summons 9 arrows.\n\nThis section would benefit from the addition of more images.\n\nPlease remove this notice once you've added suitable images to the article.\n\nThe specific instructions are: Ender dragon

dragon's hitbox, especially her wings, is unexpected larger than the ender dragon itself, causing players to be pushed away from her from farther away than usual.\n\nIf the player kills a summoned dragon in the Overworld or Nether, it does not create a portal or an egg.\n\nIn Spectator mode, the player cannot view the perspective of the ender dragon, unlike any other mob.\n\nHowever, it is possible through the use of commands (like / spectate).\n\nWhen this happens, the player's camera appears about 1 block over the dragon's body.\n\nUsing F3 + B  [JE only ] to show hitboxes reveals that the ender dragon's head rotation faces in the opposite direction to where its real head faces.\n\nThis is also why the ender dragon faces the wrong way when set in a monster spawner.\n\nWhen an ender dragon is spawned in the Overworld, it flies to coordinates X=0 and Z=0 and dives at the ground or does the same behavior as if in the End.\n\nIf end crystals are placed in the Overworld, they heal the dragon as normal, but it does not perch anywhere, and continues to fly around forever.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, there is an unused texture file for a dragon fireball item.\n\nIn Super Smash Bros.\n\nUltimate, one of the spirits that comes with the Steve/Alex DLC is the ender dragon.\n\nIt appears as a Legend-class \"spirit\" that makes the user breathe fire for a long time at the start of each battle.\n\nA wither that is summoned to battle the ender dragon cannot deal damage because the ender dragon flies too fast, and she is immune to projectiles when perching.\n\nIf commands or Creative mode are used to get end portal frames and eyes of ender, a player can basically skip to the end poem.\n\nIf a player destroys ender crystals or even hurts the dragon and then uses a player-made portal, upon returning, the player retains their progress. [BE only ] The end dragon has the longest death sound She is clearly biologically female because she can lay eggs.\n\n(It\u2019s best not to think about this too much with chickens and cows) On Reddit, Notch suggested the ender dragon's name to be \"Jean?\" in the same manner he called the player \"Steve?\".\n\n[6] Dinnerbone later stated that he thinks the name is officially \"Jean?\".\n\n[7] Despite this, an article on Minecraft.net states that \"uttering its true name would unleash a destructive force that would obliterate not only the End, but the Nether and the Overworld at the same time.\" [8] Notch referred to the ender dragon as a she on Reddit [citation needed ], the Xbox avatar item Ender Dragon Pet has the description \"A cuter, friendlier version of his bigger, less playful Minecraft sister,\" and the encyclopedia in Bedrock Edition refers to the dragon with feminine pronouns.\n\nhowever, it has been later confirmed by Notch, [9] Brandon Pearce [10] and Jeb [11] that all mobs in Minecraft have no gender, which would include ender dragon unless they don\u2019t count bosses.\n\nBefore she was textured, Notch reported that he was afraid to texture the ender dragon as she was a complicated model.\n\n[12] In the end, the dragon model was so complex Notch stated that he gave up making the texture manually and wrote a texture packer tool to aid him in adding the texture to the model.\n\nNotch also uploaded the code for the tool so others could use the pack.\n\n(Link to the texture packer) [13] Notch joked about how Minecraft was \"going next-gen\" when deadmau5 mentioned this.\n\n[14] Notch has uploaded a video showing why ender dragons do not spawn in the main world, as they would destroy any block they touch.\n\n[15] On Reddit, Notch explained that ender dragons destroy Overworld matter because \"trying to make an AI to properly navigate arbitrary terrain before the code freeze next tuesday [sic ] isn't feasible\".\n\n[16]

they also make loud and lengthy sounds while being stared at.\n\nIf the player continues to maintain eye contact, the enderman does not move [Java Edition only ], although it may teleport away.\n\nOnce the player stops looking at the enderman, it runs toward the back of the player to attack, although it ceases if hit by another player or mob.\n\n[2] An aggravated enderman runs fast and often teleports to the location of a player or mob up to 32 blocks away (orthogonally).\n\nEndermen are not provoked by a player viewing it through a transparent block or while wearing a carved pumpkin.\n\nAn aggravated enderman pursues the player until it is either killed or distracted by external elements, such as rain or fire.\n\nThey do not take damage from sunlight like undead mobs, but when at a sufficient light level under the sky during the day they teleport randomly, typically winding up in caves (although certain non-full blocks, such as soul sand and mud, also register as \"dark\" when the enderman is standing in them).\n\nEndermen can be harmed by melee attacks, water, lava, fire, splash water bottles, or rain.\n\nThey are not damaged when standing in a filled cauldron  [Java Edition only ].\n\n[3] Endermen teleport away when they take damage from any of natural sources (1), continuing to do so until they find a safe location.\n\nThey also teleport while taking damage from other sources, such as suffocation, Poison, or Wither.\n\nRanged attacks are largely ineffective against endermen, as they teleport when hit by a projectile instead of taking damage.\n\nEndermen that are hit by projectiles do not become hostile.\n\n[4] Arrows  [Java Edition only ] and tridents appear to bounce off an enderman who is unable to teleport.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, arrows go straight through endermen that are unable to teleport (but the effect still goes through if it's a tipped arrow).\n\n[needs in-game testing ].\n\nRocket crossbows do affect endermen and can trigger endermen hostility toward the shooter.\n\nEndermen can step up one full block without having to jump.\n\nEndermen are hostile to endermites within 64 blocks but are passive to other mobs unless provoked.\n\nAn enderman in a player's vicinity prevents the player from sleeping in a bed at night as if any hostile mob were nearby.\n\nIf the player is already asleep in a bed, it is possible for an enderman to teleport on it and wake players by pushing them off.\n\nThe endermen's aggression range for being looked at is reduced when the player is sneaking, or under the Invisibility effect depending on the number of armor pieces currently worn.\n\nThe detection range in blocks for invisible players is shown in the following table: They play a sound exclusively at the teleportation destination.\n\n[5] Each teleportation attempt chooses a random destination 32 blocks along each axis (i.e.\n\na 64\u00d764\u00d764 cube centered on the current position).\n\nIt then applies the following checks: As long as the selected block is not a made of a movement-blocking material, seek downwards.\n\nIf the found block is waterlogged, the teleportation attempt fails.\n\nStarting again with the originally selected target, seek downwards as long as the block below is not a made of a movement-blocking material.\n\nThe teleportation attempt succeeds if no liquid or solid blocks prevent them from standing at the destination.\n\nThus, endermen need at least three non-solid blocks above the destination to successfully teleport, and do not teleport to waterlogged blocks unless the ceiling above is made of a non-waterlogged movement-blocking material.\n\n[6] Blocks that have a large enough collision box but are not made of a movement-blocking material, such as carpet that is not above a block made of a movement-blocking material, snow layers 10 or more deep, and azalea, can be used to prevent teleportation.\n\nEndermen always teleport an integer Y distance, so an enderman at Y=70.0 cannot teleport onto a movement-blocking block covered by a single carpet, snow layers only 2 deep, or many other short blocks, while an enderman at Y=70.99 could teleport onto snow layers 8 or 9 deep.\n\nEndermen always attempt to teleport upon taking damage.\n\nMost melee attacks are successful, but the enderman usually teleports a few blocks behind the player when hit, if there is space behind the player.\n\nEndermen can be attacked with projectiles if they are in a boat or minecart. [Java Edition only ] If all available blocks within teleport distance are removed or unavailable as a destination, it is possible to hit endermen in Java Edition with a projectile, although arrows may simply bounce off, dealing no damage.\n\n[7] When teleporting due to damage, it makes 64 attempts to teleport.\n\nIn Java Edition, an enderman cannot teleport while it is in a minecart or boat, although in rain and water it attempts to do so, always teleporting back repeatedly until death.\n\nThis does not occur in Bedrock Edition.\n\n[8] Unlike any other mobs, which cannot hold blocks except as items, endermen have a unique ability to pick up, carry and set down certain blocks.\n\nThey silently [9] pick up blocks in a 4\u00d73\u00d74 (xyz) region horizontally centered on the enderman and vertically encompassing it.\n\nAn enderman cannot pick up blocks in a completely flat area.\n\nEndermen drop the block they are holding upon death as an item, although they do not visually let go of the block when dying.\n\n[10] [11] It does not despawn while holding a block.\n\nEndermen cannot place blocks onto bedrock or entities.\n\nEndermen can pick up the following blocks: Cactus Clay Coarse Dirt Rooted Dirt Dirt Flowers (short) Fungi Roots Grass Block Gravel Melon Moss Block Mud Muddy Mangrove Roots Mushrooms Mycelium Nylium Podzol Pumpkins Red Sand Sand TNT Data packs from Java Edition can change this list by modifying the minecraft:enderman_holdable block tag.\n\nBedrock Edition behavior packs can not modify these as the list is hard-coded behind the minecraft:behavior.enderman_take_block method.\n\nWhile carrying a block, the enderman sometimes silently [12] places it in a 2\u00d72\u00d72 region horizontally centered on the enderman and vertically at the same level as the enderman itself if the target location is air with a non-air block beneath and the block is allowed to be placed at the target location.\n\nEndermen cannot pick up or place down blocks if the game rule mobGriefing is set to false.\n\nEndermen can randomly breach walls, bridge fences, break redstone circuitry, set off explosions and kill themselves if they place a block of TNT on a power source and even construct golems by removing or placing blocks.\n\nEndermen can pick up or place down blocks even when angry.\n\nIn Java Edition, users can summon an enderman holding any block (including the ones not listed above) using the carriedBlockState NBT data.\n\nFor example, to summon an enderman holding a grass block with no AI where the player is standing: /summon minecraft:enderman ~ ~ ~ {NoAI:1,carriedBlockState:{Name:\"grass_block\"}} Java Edition: Endermen use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock

maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe developers have stated that the belief that enderman sounds are backward distortions is just speculation.\n\n[21] Notch claimed in public that the enderman is a \"subtle reference\" to the Slenderman, a similar-looking monster with a similar name.\n\nGiven the later development of the End, it is possible he already had the name in mind, and did not choose it because of the Reddit thread in which their name was revealed.\n\n[22] According to Burnie Burns, former CEO of Rooster Teeth, the idea for endermen's weakness to water came from his son JD during a visit to Mojang's headquarters.\n\n[23] Dinnerbone suggested \"a haunting of endermen\" as the collective noun for Endermen.\n\n[24] Additionally, in the third episode of Minecraft: Story Mode, The Last Place You Look, a player is given the option to correct the grammar of other characters by specifying that the collective noun for a group of endermen is \"a haunting of Endermen\".\n\nIn the fourth Minecraft novel Minecraft: The End, the collective term used by endermen themselves is \"an End of Endermen\".\n\nSwitching to spectator mode and taking an enderman's point of view adds a shader that inverts colors, suggesting that they see the End as an island of blue cobblestone (as end stone is a yellowish version of cobblestone with inverted colors) in a white sky, with white pillars, white endermen with green eyes and a white ender dragon, also with green eyes.\n\nThey also see cobblestone as end stone.\n\nThe texture for an enderman's eyes is located in a different texture file than the body, allowing their eyes to glow.\n\nBecause the two textures do not line up perfectly, forcing an enderman to look straight up causes its eyes to turn blank white.\n\nThis also causes the enderman's eyes to be visible even when under the Invisibility effect.\n\nThe enderman teleportation sound also plays when a player teleports using an ender pearl  [Bedrock Edition only ] or chorus fruit.\n\nThe enderman is a playable DLC character in the crossover fighting game Super Smash Bros.\n\nUltimate as an alternate costume for Steve, though with altered proportions to be at Steve's height.\n\nAdditionally, there is an enderman \"spirit\" that makes the user vulnerable to damage by water, as are regular endermen.\n\nEndermen are trying to bring about the collapse to all dimensions, as revealed in the 2019 book Minecraft Game Design.\n\n[25] Enderman holding a grass block Enderman holding sand Enderman holding a cactus Enderman holding TNT Enderman

[JE only ]) In Bedrock Edition, evokers can spawn in peaceful difficulty, and will not attack the player.\n\nEvokers can spawn during raids by themselves or riding ravagers.\n\nEvokers cannot spawn in raids in easy difficulty, because such raids have only three waves, while evokers appear in the fifth wave and above.\n\nEvokers spawn during raids starting at wave 5.\n\nUp to 5 evokers spawn on hard difficulty.\n\nDuring these events, they can be a raid captain.\n\nOn hard difficulty, evokers can also spawn riding a ravager at wave 7.\n\nThey may also rarely spawn as a raid captain.\n\nUp to 5 evokers spawn during raids, with 1 evoker spawning during waves 5 and 6, and 3 evokers spawning during wave 7.\n\nOne of them rides a ravager during wave 7.\n\n1 Totem of Undying.\n\nThe Looting enchantment does not increase this drop, and it is always dropped, no matter if another mob killed it or not.\n\n0\u20131 Emerald if killed by the player, with an increase by 1 with each level of looting, 0-4 maximum.\n\n1 ominous banner  [JE only ] or illager banner  [BE only ], if they spawn as a wave leader in raid or take an ominous banner on the ground.\n\n10 experience when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nAn evoker moves at the player's sprinting speed, crosses its arms and does not show its hands.\n\nAn evoker visually does not sit down when sitting in a boat or minecart.\n\nIf an evoker is riding a ravager, its legs appear to sink in the ravager's body.\n\nThis only happens in Bedrock Edition, as evokers put their legs in front of them while sitting on any entity in Java Edition.\n\nAn evoker attacking with its fangs.\n\nEvokers attack players, adult villagers, iron golems, snow golems  [BE only ] and wandering traders within 12 blocks by rising and waving both of their arms while looking at their target and summoning magical fangs or vexes, creating different colored particles for the different attacks.\n\nIf the player is within a 10 block radius and the evoker is not in the middle of summoning an attack, the evoker flees from the player to avoid being attacked.\n\nAn evoker summoning fangs in two circles around it.\n\nEvokers are passive in Peaceful difficulty  [BE only ].\n\nThey will still attack any adult villagers, iron golems, wandering traders, or snow golems in the Peaceful difficulty.\n\nIf an evoker is attacked, all nearby [needs testing ] evokers become alerted and start attacking the player, even if they are behind walls.\n\nIn Java Edition, the alerted evokers can attack the player from an infinite distance away, even if the player switches to Creative or Spectator mode [1]; this can be fixed by relogging the world, or by setting the game rule universalAnger to True [needs testing ].\n\nIn Java Edition, an evoker is passive to other illagers even if it is harmed.\n\nAny evoker can search for and join a patrol if sufficiently near a patrol captain.\n\nIn Java Edition, evokers and illusioners are faster without any effects during raids.\n\nIn Java Edition, evokers are given 3 seconds of the Glowing effect if a bell is rung within 32 blocks of them.\n\nThis applies to both evokers spawned in raids and evokers spawned in woodland mansions.\n\nEvokers flee from creakings when within 8 blocks of them.\n\nThe evoker signals this attack by producing purple particles () and a low-pitched sound.\n\nA number of fangs rise out of the ground around the player, then snap shut and vanish.\n\nPlayers or mobs caught in the attack are dealt 6 damage, regardless of difficulty.\n\nThis harm is not mitigated by armor but is mitigated by enchantments such as Protection.\n\nAny evoker-summoned fangs do not deal damage to any illagers (witches are not illagers, so can be damaged and will retaliate [other than in a raid, in which case the witch will drink a beneficial potion and ignore [needs testing ] ]), although fangs summoned or spawned by the player do.\n\nFangs appear no lower than the feet of the lowest combatant and no higher than one block above the feet of the highest combatant.\n\nFangs attempt to appear on the highest opaque block between those two extremes, but fail to spawn if they are obstructed by a solid block.\n\nIn practice, this means that fangs cannot spawn inside deep pits or on top of high walls, but may, for example, go up a staircase if the target is at the top and the evoker at the bottom, or vice versa.\n\nLikewise, an evoker floating in a boat on water cannot summon fangs against a player swimming or floating in a boat because there are no opaque blocks from which the fangs can appear.\n\nThe evoker typically summons 16 fangs in a straight line toward the target.\n\nHowever, if the target is within 3 blocks of the evoker, the evoker summons the fangs in two circles around itself: the smaller circle has 5 fangs and the larger has 8.\n\nThe fangs do not seek the player, thus the player is able to dodge them.\n\nSummoning fangs resets the evoker's spell cooldown to two seconds and resets the cooldown for summoning fangs to five seconds.\n\nIf a neutral or hostile mob is caught in an evoker's fang attack, the mob attacks the evoker.\n\nThe evoker signals this attack by producing white particles () for two seconds and a higher-pitched sound.\n\nThree vexes appear nearby.\n\nThe evoker can summon vexes as long as there are fewer than eight vexes within 16 blocks centered on the evoker.\n\nThis spell resets the evoker's spell cooldown to five seconds and resets the cooldown for summoning vexes to 17 seconds.\n\nAn evoker summoning vexes.\n\nIn Java Edition, evokers may summon two circle fangs while summoning vexes, without any cooldown.\n\nIt usually happens when a player melee attacks an evoker while it is summoning vexes.\n\nThe Minecraft Dungeons' evoker also feature this combo attack behavior.\n\nAn evoker using its sheep color conversion spell.\n\nWhile the evoker is not engaged in combat and / gamerule mobGriefing is set to true, it changes the wool color of any blue sheep within 16 blocks from blue to red.\n\nAfter the spell, the sheep is red.\n\nThe evoker signals this spell by producing orange particles () and making a \" wololo \" sound.\n\nThis spell resets the evoker's spell cooldown to three seconds and resets the cooldown for the sheep color conversion spell to seven seconds.\n\nEvokers look at the sheep they are using the spell on while they are doing the spell until they finish the spell.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, evokers can still change a sheep's color when / gamerule mobGriefing is set to false.\n\nThis section of the article is empty.\n\nYou can help by adding to it.\n\nThis article is about the evoker fangs in Minecraft.\n\nFor evoker fangs in Minecraft Dungeons, see MCD:Evoker \u00a7 Evoker fang.\n\nEvoker Fangs Behavior Does not exist Details Size Height: 0.8 Blocks Width: 0.5 Blocks Evoker fangs are the entities that evokers use to attack the player with their fang attack.\n\nEvoker fangs are not affected by the peaceful difficulty.\n\nThe individual fangs in an evoker's fang attacks each have a delay.\n\nBefore the delay is over, the fangs cannot be seen, although unlike truly invisible entities, fangs in warmup still have a visible debug hitbox.\n\nAfter the delay, the fangs expand into existence, snap shut, make critical hit particles and shrink out of sight again, dealing 6 magic damage to all mobs standing on the spot.\n\nKilling an evoker fang does not contribute to the Monster Hunter advancement or achievement.\n\nJava Edition: Evokers use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Main article: Entity

value continues ticking down while the closing animation is playing, reaching -20 on naturally spawned fangs.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Evoker\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe sheep color conversion spell is a reference to the priest units from Age of Empires, where they can turn enemy units into friendly units (changing the unit's color in the process) after making a \"wololo\" sound.\n\nBecause Microsoft controls the copyrights for both Age of Empires and Minecraft, Mojang was able to get the actual \"wololo\" sound effect to use in the conversion sound effect.\n\nEvokers are referred to as 'evocation illagers' in the code for pre-1.13 and Bedrock Edition code.\n\nHitting an evoker in survival mode and converting the gamemode into creative mode still causes the evoker to summon fangs and vexes at the player, although they deal no damage.\n\nA dying evoker mob.\n\nAn evoker

In Bedrock Edition, two ghasts can spawn within any 4 chunk span.\n\nGhasts do not spawn in nether fortresses, but they can wander nearby.\n\nGhast tear (0\u20131).\n\nLooting increases the maximum ghast tears dropped by one per level, for a maximum of 4 ghast tears with Looting III.\n\nGunpowder (0\u20132).\n\nLooting increases the maximum gunpowder dropped by one per level, for a maximum of 5 gunpowder with Looting III.\n\n5 when killed by the player.\n\nGhasts float around the Nether with their eyes and mouth closed and periodically make crying sounds, which can be heard from up to 80 blocks away.\n\nThey have a hitbox of 4\u00d74\u00d74 blocks, as well as nine tentacles that are not included in the hitbox.\n\nWhen within range, a ghast faces the player and shoots a fireball every 3 seconds, opening its eyes and mouth and making a screeching sound.\n\nA ghast requires a line of sight to the player before firing, which can be blocked by any solid block including transparent blocks.\n\nIn Java Edition, they target players within 64 blocks horizontally and 4 blocks vertically [1], and continue attacking as long as they are within a 64 block sphere and have line of sight.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a ghast normally targets a player within a sphere of 28 blocks, increasing to 64 blocks if the player damages it.\n\nGhasts can cause other mobs to attack them, but in Java Edition they never target other mobs, only the player.\n\nUnlike most other hostile mobs, ghasts do not attempt to approach the player once aggravated, but instead fire at the player from their position within firing range.\n\nWhen at close range, ghasts may take damage and die from their own fireball explosions.\n\nGhasts can be set on fire, but fire or lava does not harm them.\n\nWhen a ghast sinks into lava, or crosses a lava fall, its speed drops and it is immobilized for a while, making it more vulnerable to arrow shots.\n\nDespite their ghostly appearance, ghasts are not considered undead mobs.\n\n[2] This means they can drown, [3] are damaged by Instant Damage [4] and healed by Instant Health, are affected by Poison, [5] and are not affected by Smite.\n\n[6] Although they are not undead mobs, ghasts are never targeted by withers deliberately.\n\n[7] Despite that they are flying mobs, ghasts can destroy turtle eggs when on top of them.\n\n[8] Fireball Behavior Does not exist Details Size Height: JE: 1 Block BE: 0.31 blocks Width: JE: 1 Block BE: 0.31 blocks Main article: Fireball Ghasts shoot fireballs at players, dealing damage to nearby blocks and entities.\n\nJava Edition: Ghasts use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b c d MC-218108 \u2191 a b MC-177079 Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Main article: Entity format Ghasts have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nEntity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs ExplosionPower: The radius of the explosion created by the fireballs the ghast fires.\n\nDefault value is 1.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nFor historical information specifically pertaining to fireballs, see Fireball \u00a7 History.\n\nIssues relating to \"Ghast\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nIn English, \" ghast \" is an archaic word meaning \"ghastly\".\n\n[13] H.P.\n\nLovecraft first coined its use as the name for a monster (a vaguely humanoid one, in The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath), but \"ghasts\" have appeared in many other fantasy stories and games.\n\nThe player can go inside of a ghast by falling through the top of it or flying (or jumping while attacking) up underneath it.\n\nIf the player stands on top of the head, the player sees inside of it.\n\nIf a ghast is trapped in a 1-thick cube, it shoots fireballs through the cube.\n\nThis is because all mobs that shoot spawn the projectile one block in front of it to prevent the projectile from hitting the mob.\n\nOn rare occasions, ghasts spawn in such a way as to see through blocks (usually trapped on all sides in a tight area).\n\nWhen this happens and the ghast has a \"line of sight\" through those blocks, it launches a fireball in the player's direction.\n\nThis is reminiscent of a blaze but with explosive addition.\n\nC418 revealed in an AMA on Reddit that ghast sounds are taken from his pet cat, who makes them when disturbed while sleeping.\n\n[14] Two ghasts are featured in the LEGO set \"Minecraft Micro World - The Nether\", along with a Zombified Piglin.\n\nWhen killed with its own fireball, a ghast turns orange rather than red.

[JE only ] See also: Tutorials/Combat \u00a7 Guardians Guardians have two methods of attack: a laser and a defensive attack analogous to the Thorns enchantment.\n\nUnlike most other hostile mobs, a guardian does not follow a player who moves out of sight.\n\nInstead, it simply continues swimming until the player becomes visible again to start charging its laser.\n\nGuardians attack players, axolotls, and squid.\n\nOtherwise, a guardian does not retaliate against mobs (such as iron golems) that attack it, other than damaging the attacking mob with its natural thorns defense.\n\nLaser The laser takes 2 seconds to charge, doing no damage in the meantime.\n\nIt starts out purple and fades to yellow.\n\nOnce charged, the laser flashes green and deals 6 regular damage and additional 1 magical damage on normal difficulty.\n\nThe latter bypasses armor.\n\nGuardians swim around for 3 seconds before firing again.\n\nIf the target approaches while the guardian is loading its laser, it stops firing and swims away until it is at a comfortable range, at which point it continues attacking.\n\nThe laser cannot be dodged or blocked by a shield and has a maximum range of 15 blocks.\n\nOnce the target is out of range, or if the laser is obstructed by solid blocks (including transparent blocks like glass), the guardian's laser disengages.\n\nSpikes defense Guardians deal damage each time it is hit with a melee attack while its spikes are extended, similar to the Thorns armor enchantment.\n\nIf cornered, the guardian usually extends its spikes and fires at the player, even at point-blank range.\n\nJava Edition: Guardians use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 Increases quadratically from minimum to maximum as the attack goes on \u2191 Increases linearly from minimum to maximum as the attack goes on Bedrock Edition: \u2191 MCPE-26929 Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Guardians have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nNote: This video is outdated in Java Edition, as raw fish, cooked fish and clownfish are now called raw cod, cooked cod, and tropical fish as of 1.13.\n\nIssues relating to \"Guardian\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nA guardian's eye is actually the \"head\" part of the mob 's model.\n\nThis gives the illusion of a dynamic eye.\n\nGuardians' laser-beam attacks are affected by the potion of strength, which normally affects only melee attacks.\n\nWhen placed or spawned on a slime block, guardians start bouncing and continue and each bounce higher than the last, until each bounce brings the guardian to 17 blocks height.\n\nIn the texture file for the guardian, \"jeb\" is written in the bottom right corner.\n\n[verify ] If summoned with {NoAI:1}, the guardian's eye still follows the player.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, guardians do not make the flopping sounds while on land.\n\nJeb 's Instagram mob reveal.\n\nThe inside of a guardian (with their spikes extended).\n\nA guardian's \"eye\" follows players at any position.\n\nA guardian attacking a squid.\n\nA group of guardians defending their monument.\n\nSize comparison between a guardian and its elder variant.\n\nA guardian in a boat.\n\nThe guardian texture, with \"jeb\" written in the corner.\n\nThe guardian face texture as revealed by Jeb on reddit.\n\nGuardians in promotional artwork for the Boss Update.\n\nLego Minecraft Guardian.\n\n\u2191 MC-57057 \u2014 Guardian laser attack sound ignores distance Meet the Guardian \u2013 Minecraft.net on September 25, 2017 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

breedable hostile mob found in the Nether, and a source of porkchops and leather.\n\nA hoglin attacks by thrusting its tusks upward, which can also launch its target a short distance into the air.\n\nHoglins are repelled by warped fungi that is placed in the world as well as active nether portals and respawn anchors.\n\nBaby hoglins behave similarly, but have a much weaker attack (the weakest attack in the game) with normal knockback, and flee when hit.\n\nHoglins are found in herds of 3\u20134 in crimson forests, respawning over time.\n\nThey can spawn at any light level and on most solid blocks other than nether wart blocks and shroomlights.\n\nHoglins spawn in certain types of bastion remnants upon structure generation.\n\nThey spawn frequently in the hoglin stable variant (specifically the large and small stables in the \"lower\" area, but never in the \"upper\" area with ramparts), and sometimes in the main \"bridge entrance\" at the upper half of the rampart in the bridge variant.\n\nSimilarly to the piglins and piglin brutes there, these hoglins never despawn.\n\n20% of hoglins spawn as babies.\n\nHoglins spawn in Peaceful difficulty, but are passive to players.\n\nAdult hoglins drop when killed: 2\u20134 raw porkchop (cooked porkchop while on fire).\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 7 with Looting III.\n\n0\u20131 leather.\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 4 with Looting III.\n\n5 [JE only ] or 1\u20133 [BE only ] if killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nBaby hoglins drop only experience when killed, at the same rate as adult hoglins.\n\nThey are also the only mobs that both grow up and also drop experience.\n\nHoglins avoid warped fungi (including in a flower pot), nether portals and respawn anchors, and will run away from them when within 7 blocks of them.\n\nThey naturally sink in water and eventually drown.\n\n[1] They also sink in lava and are vulnerable to fire damage.\n\n[2] Hoglins can be led with a lead despite the fact they are hostile.\n\nHoglins attack any player within 16 blocks with a reach of 1.9 blocks.\n\nAn adult knocks its target upward.\n\nPlayers can still be flung even if they block with a shield.\n\nHoglins do not attack a player standing near a block that repels them, but run away from the block unless they have already chosen to attack.\n\nHoglins are 60% resistant to knockback.\n\nUnlike other hostile mobs, they do not prevent a player from sleeping.\n\nSimilarly to piglins and zombified piglins, a player or mob attacking a hoglin provokes all nearby hoglins.\n\nAttacking a baby hoglin does not trigger this behavior.\n\nIf a piglin attacks a hoglin, all the hoglins in the area retaliate.\n\nHoglins also flee if outnumbered and make retreating sounds.\n\nIf the piglins are outnumbered by hoglins, they flee and make retreating sounds.\n\nHoglins that spawn upon generation of bastion remnants are not hunted by piglins.\n\nBaby hoglins also attack the player, dealing much less damage and normal knockback.\n\nIf the player attacks a baby hoglin, it temporarily flees.\n\nBaby piglins run near and ride baby hoglins.\n\nIf there are more baby piglins than baby hoglins, the baby piglins occasionally jump on other baby piglins already riding a baby hoglin, with a maximum of 3 stacked on a single baby hoglin.\n\nA hoglin turning into a zoglin.\n\nNotice the hair is flattened down.\n\nIf a hoglin spawns in or moves to the Overworld or the End, it shakes and then transforms into a zoglin after 15 seconds.\n\nThe newly-created zoglin gets Nausea I for 10 seconds.\n\nThis Nausea effect is only decorative and has no effect on the zoglin's behavior.\n\nIn Java Edition, any lead attached to the hoglin breaks when it converts, even though zoglins can have leads attached to them.\n\n[3] Main article: Breeding Other than the killer bunny  [Java Edition only ], the hoglin is the only hostile mob that can be bred.\n\nHoglins can be bred using crimson fungi.\n\nIt takes 5 minutes before the parents can be bred again, and it takes 20 minutes for baby hoglins to mature.\n\nBaby hoglins stay near their parents unless they see a player or get attacked, in which case they attack or run away.\n\nFeeding a crimson fungus to a baby hoglin reduces the remaining time for it to mature by 10%.\n\nHoglins cannot be bred when they are running away from warped fungi, respawn anchors or nether portals.\n\nFeeding crimson fungi to a hoglin prevents it from despawning, regardless of whether the breeding is successful or not.\n\nThe baby hoglin produced by breeding does not despawn either.\n\nJava Edition: Hoglins use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 Except idle1, which is 0.65, and idle4, which is 0.7 \u2191 a b c MC-98316 \u2014 Wrong subtitles caused by missing distinction \u2191 Except for retreat1 (the

300.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Hoglin\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe reason Hoglins run away from warped fungi is because they dislike their smell.\n\n[7] Similarly, when asked if nether portals smell bad to Hoglins, Henrik responded saying that the reason Hoglins run away from Nether Portals is because they find the sound annoying.\n\n[8] Similar to the ravager originally being called \" illager beast\" before its official name was chosen by the community, the Hoglin's name was also chosen by the community.\n\nIts initial placeholder name was \"piglin beast\".\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, there are unused texture files named hoglin_meat_raw and hoglin_meat_cooked that are textured identically to raw and cooked beef, respectively.\n\nHenrik Kniberg released a video [9] of a group of hoglins killing a piglin, then \"celebrating\" by bobbing their heads, then getting on their hind legs and

    "content": "For the powerful mob in Minecraft Dungeons, see MCD:Illusioner.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Java Edition.\n\nIllusioner Illusioner Casting Aiming Health 32 \u00d7 16 Classification Illager hostile mob Behavior Hostile Damage Easy and normal: 2 \u2013 5 Hard: 3 \u2013 5 The illusioner is an unused illager armed with a bow.\n\nIt attacks using illusions and can also fire arrows.\n\nAn illusioner has no spawn egg in the Creative mode inventory.\n\nAn illusioner can be spawned only using data packs or the / summon illusioner in-game command.\n\nIllusioners do not spawn in woodland mansions or pillager outposts, nor at raids or patrols.\n\nSimilarly to the other unused giant and zombie horse mobs, illusioners do not spawn in any biome, monster spawner or world -generated structure.\n\nWhen an illusioner is killed by a player or a tamed wolf, any naturally spawned equipment, including its unenchanted bow, has an 8.5% chance of dropping (or 9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) and drops with a random item durability.\n\nIn addition, 5 experience orbs are dropped on player or tamed wolf kills.\n\nAn invisible illusioner captain and its four copies strafing.\n\nThe real banner is invisible.\n\nThe illusioner also drops one illager ominous banner if it is a raid captain.\n\nAlthough they do not naturally spawn in raids, illusioners spawned by the player attack players, adult villagers, iron golems and wandering traders within a 16*4*16 cubic area.\n\nAn illusioner joins a nearby raid if it occurs or joins a patrol if sufficiently near a patrol captain.\n\nThe illusioner attacks with its spells and its bow, firing an arrow every second.\n\nUnless the illusioner is summoned using commands, it cannot attack with a non-bow item in its hand, cannot use tipped arrows in its offhand slot (but can use spectral arrows) and cannot use enchanted bows.\n\nAlso, it is the only illager that can see its target through walls.\n\nThe Illusioner moves quickly on a semi-circular fashion and always tries to maintain a consistent distance between itself and the player, strafing from left to right and vice-versa, retreating if the player gets too close or advancing if the player retreats.\n\nFinally, the illusioner has two spells: a spell that blinds its opponent and a spell that summons visual pseudo-duplicates and makes the illusioner invisible.\n\nThe illusioner casts its blindness spell only if the regional difficulty is greater than 2.\n\nAs result, the world difficulty setting, the inhabited time of a chunk, the total daytime in the world and the phase of the moon from the day-night cycle affects its ability.\n\nAn illusioner's four false duplicates.\n\nThe real illusioner is invisible.\n\nAn illusioner casts a Blindness effect that lasts for 20 seconds upon first engaging a new player opponent.\n\nIt signals this attack by raising its arms during a short-timed animation, making a low pitched sound and producing a black mist of particles ().\n\nOther entities (typically a wolf, a snow golem or an iron golem) do not trigger this magic.\n\nThe illusioner does not cast this spell more than once on the same player opponent, unless it has first shifted its attention to another opponent and then back to that original opponent.\n\nThis spell resets the illusioner's spell cooldown to 1 second and resets the cooldown for the blinding spell to 9 seconds.\n\nAs long as an illusioner is engaged in combat, it casts an Invisibility status effect on itself that lasts 60 seconds and refreshes the effect whenever the Invisibility's time runs out.\n\nThe illusioner signals this spell by raising its arms, making a strange high pitched sound and producing a blue mist of particles called \"mirror\" ().\n\nWhen an illusioner becomes invisible through this or another method, it creates four false duplicates of itself.\n\nThese hover and waver at short distances from the actually invisible illusioner, though they do not space themselves out until the first time the illusioner is attacked.\n\nThey face in exactly the same direction as the illusioner and move somewhat in step with the original, appearing to no-clip through blocks like a vex does.\n\nDespite using the shooting animation whenever the original uses its bow, only the real illusioner can shoot and be damaged.\n\nThe clones move to new positions if they were not triggered and are still bunched together.\n\nThe Illusioner can also do this once in a while to \"refresh\" the clones' positions.\n\nWhen the real illusioner is damaged, its duplicates all snap back to where the real illusioner is, then quickly snap back out to new positions, making a teleporting sound, signaling the hit.\n\nIf an invisible illusioner receives the Glowing effect, all of the duplicates glow, while the true illusioner remains invisible.\n\nMoreover, only the invisible illusioner burns when catching fire.\n\nThe duplicates dissipate once the illusioner's Invisibility effect ends.\n\nThis spell resets the illusioner's spell cooldown to 1 second and resets the cooldown for the invisibility spell to 17 seconds.\n\nIllusioners use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b c MC-98316 See also: Entity format Illusioners have entity data associated with them

    "content": "This article is about the mob.\n\nFor the Minecraft Dungeons mob, see MCD:Magma Cube.\n\nFor the block, see Magma Block.\n\nMagma Cube Health Big: 16 \u00d7 8 Medium: 4 Small: 1

magma cube is a hostile mob found in the Nether.\n\nA magma cube behaves similarly to a slime, but is fireproof, jumps higher and less often, and deals more damage.\n\nSee also: Spawn \u00a7 Spawn cycle Magma cubes spawn in areas of the Nether at all light levels.\n\nThe space they spawn in must be clear of solid obstructions and liquids.\n\nDue to being inherently fireproof, magma cubes can spawn on magma blocks.\n\nOnly sizes 1, 2 and 4 (NBT Size tag values 0, 1 and 3 respectively) spawn naturally.\n\nWith use of / summon, magma cubes can potentially range from size 1 to 127 (NBT Size tag 0\u2013126).\n\n[verify ] This large magma cube attempts to spawn on the basalt, but because there is a piece of iron bar intersecting its hitbox, it is unable to spawn.\n\nThis check is performed before the size of the magma cube is determined, meaning no magma cubes can spawn at that location.\n\nA magma cube needs roughly a 3\u00d72.1x3 free space to spawn.\n\nThe area in which they spawn must be clear of solid or liquid obstructions.\n\nWhen a magma cube attempts to spawn, the game checks for the space requirement of a large magma cube, and the size is determined later.\n\nTherefore, since large magma cubes are slightly taller than 2 blocks, no magma cubes, regardless of size, are able to spawn at all in 2-block-high areas.\n\nAlso, since large magma cubes are slightly wider than 2 blocks, and mobs spawn at the center of a block, having any block within the 3\u00d72.1x3 area, even as thin as a glass pane, can prevent a magma cube of any size from spawning.\n\nMagma cubes' size is affected by regional difficulty: chances range from 33% for each size at the low difficulty to 16% small, 33% medium, and 50% big with higher difficulty.\n\nMagma cubes spawn uncommonly in nether wastes in groups of 1 to 4.\n\nMagma cubes spawn commonly in nether fortresses in groups of 4.\n\nMagma cubes spawn commonly in basalt deltas, in groups of 2 to 5.\n\nMagma cube monster spawners generate in the treasure room of bastions.\n\nLarge magma cube: 0\u20131 magma cream (0.25 average) and 4 experience Medium magma cube: 0\u20131 magma cream (0.25 average) and 2 experience Small magma cube: 1 experience (or 1 froglight if killed by a frog).\n\nThe maximum of magma cream can be increased by 1 per level of Looting.\n\nLooting 1 averages 0.5 per kill, Looting 2 averages ~0.81 per kill, and Looting 3 averages ~1.21 per kill.\n\nUnlike a lot of common loot which picks a random number between 0 and 1 for its drop, the magma cube's drop ranges between -2 and 1 instead.\n\nThis leads to the 25% drop chance from an unenchanted kill, as well as the relatively low averages with the Looting enchantment since a negative base roll can cancel out the bonus roll made by Looting.\n\nMagma cube jumping.\n\nA magma cube seeks out any player or an iron golem within a spherical distance of 16 blocks.\n\nIf it finds no enemy, it changes direction every 40 to 100 ticks (2 to 5 seconds) and jumps forward every 40 to 120 ticks (2 to 6 seconds).\n\nIf it finds a target, the delay before jumping is 1 \u2044 3 as long (13 to 40 ticks), and the magma cube changes direction directly toward the target before jumping.\n\nMagma cubes cannot be hurt by fall damage or burning, and are not slowed down by lava.\n\nThey can swim upward in lava and leap above its surface.\n\nTheir jump height depends on their size.\n\nTheir forward speed is twice that of most other mobs.\n\nThey always make a distinct sound upon jumping up and landing, but no idle sounds.\n\nWhen a magma cube is killed, it splits into 2-4 smaller magma cubes.\n\nTiny magma cubes disappear when killed, like other mobs.\n\nThey can swim in water and attempt to stay on the surface.\n\nLike slimes, magma cubes starts taking drowning damage if submerged in water for 15 seconds, splitting into smaller cubes if possible.\n\nMagma cubes take extra damage from powder snow, taking 5 every two seconds, unlike 1 for other mobs.\n\nUnlike most mobs, magma cubes have no pathfinding ability, meaning that they do not avoid falling off cliffs and cannot go around walls, even when chasing a player.\n\nThis behavior is shared by slimes.\n\nWhen they are in lava, they hover and try to move to nearby land.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Combat \u00a7 Magma Cubes Magma cubes attack by jumping and attempting to land on the player, and cause damage when touched anywhere.\n\nAs their jump rate is random, magma cubes can be hard to fight.\n\nThe health of a magma cube is its size squared; the attack strength is its size + 2, and the armor points are its size tripled.\n\nA magma cube jumps a distance of approximately its length times 1.5 and a height equivalent to its size in blocks.\n\nThis means that a large magma cube jumps 4 blocks in height and moves significantly quicker than a small magma cube, which jumps 2 blocks in height; while a tiny magma cube moves slowly and jumps 1 block in height.\n\nMagma cubes continuously damage all players and iron golems [JE only ] they collide with (although damage immunity reduces the actual damage to 2 attacks per second), unlike other mobs that damage only those targets they specifically attack.\n\n[1] This means that a large magma cube deals 12 \u00d7 6 of damage per second on normal difficulty.\n\nUnlike slimes, tiny magma cubes can deal damage to the player.\n\nJava Edition: Magma cubes use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b c MC-98316 \u2014 Wrong subtitles

phantoms from spawning as they have a light opacity of 2, but glass does not, as its light opacity is 0.\n\nPhantoms do not spawn in Spectator mode, [JE only ] but they do spawn in Creative mode.\n\n[1] Phantom spawning is similar to other monsters spawning: the spawn location must have a light level of 7 or less, and spawns are limited by the monster population cap.\n\nPhantoms are also subject to a density cap of 5.\n\nPhantom spawn attempts are made on surface blocks throughout the same spawn radius as other monsters.\n\nHowever, when a phantom spawn attempt succeeds the phantom appears somewhere in a 21\u00d715\u00d721 cube centered 28 blocks above the player instead of at the block where the spawn attempt occurred.\n\nPhantoms attempt to spawn every 1\u20132 minutes.\n\nThey spawn only if it is night or a thunderstorm is happening, the player is above sea level (y=64) with sky access, and the local difficulty is greater than a randomly chosen value between 0.0 and 3.0.\n\nThe chance of a successful spawn is x \u221272000 \u2044 x, where x is the number of ticks since the player last entered a bed or died.\n\nThis roughly comes to a 1 \u2044 4 (25.0%) chance on day 4, a 2 \u2044 5 (40.0%) chance on day 5, a 3 \u2044 6 (1 \u2044 2) (50.0%) chance on day 6, 4 \u2044 7 (about 57.1%) chance on day 7, and so on.\n\nIf all conditions are met, a group of phantoms attempt to spawn 20\u201334 blocks above the player, and off to the side by a taxicab distance of up to 10 blocks.\n\nThe number of phantoms spawned is 1-2 in Easy difficulty, 1-3 in Normal, and 1-4 in Hard.\n\nPhantoms can spawn inside buildings, if the player is outside and the building is both near enough and the building has a large enough cavity for them to spawn inside.\n\nPhantoms are counted toward the hostile mob cap, but they don't adhere to it when spawning.\n\n[2] Their spawning mechanic is based on the location of players in the world rather than by chance, unlike regular mob spawning.\n\nPhantom spawning is completely independent of the biome, meaning they can spawn in biomes that normally prevent hostile mob spawning such as mushroom fields [3] and the void [4].\n\nPhantoms increase in number every consecutive night a player hasn't entered a bed and stop spawning when the player lies down in bed.\n\nPhantoms drop when killed: 0\u20131 phantom membrane s when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nLooting increases the maximum drops by 1 per level, for a maximum of 4 with Looting III.\n\n5 when killed by the player or a tamed wolf.\n\nA phantom swooping at the player.\n\nWhen idle, phantoms fly around in a roughly circular pattern within 15 to 25 blocks of a player horizontally and within 24 to 35 blocks of a player vertically, leaving a trail of gray smoke while doing so.\n\nTheir movement speed is one of the fastest of any mob, up to 20 blocks per second.\n\nThey have a large search radius, targeting and following players from 64 blocks away [BE only ] [more information needed ].\n\nOnce every 10-20 seconds [BE only ] [more information needed ] they swoop down or up quickly to attack.\n\nIf stopped or hurt during this action, the phantom retreats back to its original elevation.\n\nWhen a path to its original elevation is obstructed by a block, the phantom continues attempting to return to its original elevation until it either attacks or moves out from under the block.\n\nPhantoms do not attack an exposed player sleeping in a bed.\n\nPhantoms can move through water at their normal speed.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a phantom underwater attempts to fly to the surface, and dies from drowning after 20 seconds if trapped underwater.\n\nPhantoms do not drown in Java Edition.\n\nA phantom's body disappears when under the Invisibility effect, but its eyes and smoke particles are still visible.\n\nCats hiss at phantoms that are currently attacking players, and phantoms try to stay at least 64 blocks away from them.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, phantoms also avoid ocelots in the same manner.\n\nLike other undead mobs, phantoms are harmed by the Instant Health effect, healed by the Instant Damage effect, immune to the Poison and Regeneration effects, ignored by the wither, and affected by the Smite enchantment.\n\nLike zombies and skeletons, phantoms burn in sunlight.\n\nThey burn even when equipped with helmets through commands.\n\n[5] Java Edition: Phantoms use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Phantoms have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities

always have a constant 20 \u00d7 10 HP, and deal 6 + Size damage.\n\nNaturally spawned phantoms are always size 0.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Phantom\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe red phantom design was scrapped because it looked like a Nether mob.\n\nAt one point before the release of 18w10a, the phantom texture was made red, but it was decided that it appeared too much like a Nether mob.\n\n[8] The phantom was originally going to have a mouth, like the drawing shown during MINECON Earth, but it was eventually scrapped because \"it looked so much like a muppet\".\n\n[8] Earlier designs can be seen on Minecraft 's Instagram account.\n\n[9] The sounds of the phantom were taken from Samuel \u00c5berg 's baby son screaming.\n\n[10] Despite that they are flying mobs, phantoms can destroy turtle eggs when on top of them.\n\n[11] The game rule that modify Phantom spawning

A piglin is a neutral mob found in the Nether.\n\nIt is hostile to players unless they wear at least one piece of golden armor.\n\nIt can be given gold ingots to barter for various items.\n\nIt wields either a golden sword or a crossbow, and uses either melee or ranged attacks, respectively.\n\nBaby piglins do not grow up, never hold weapons or attack, and take gold without giving anything in return.\n\nPiglins spawn in groups of 2-4 in nether wastes and crimson forest biomes, and within bastion remnants upon generation, at a light level of 11 or less in Java Edition, or 7 or less in Bedrock Edition on most blocks other than nether wart blocks or magma blocks.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, they can naturally spawn even in Peaceful difficulty.\n\nEach piglin has a 20% [Java Edition only ] or 5% [Bedrock Edition only ] chance of spawning as a baby.\n\nPiglins have a 50% chance of spawning with either a sword or a crossbow.\n\nThey also have a 10% chance per armor slot of spawning with golden armor, meaning they have a 34.39% chance of spawning with any armor and a 0.01% chance of spawning with a full set.\n\nPiglins spawn in Peaceful difficulty, but are passive to players.\n\nAdults have an 8.5% chance of dropping the held item (a golden sword or crossbow with random durability).\n\nEach Looting level increases this chance by 1%.\n\nBabies spawn without equipment.\n\nIn Java Edition, a picked-up item always drops with the same durability as when picked up.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, armor picked up by piglins can lose durability and even break depending on how much damage the piglin takes.\n\nPiglins do not drop gold ingots, raw porkchops, or cooked porkchops that they have picked up.\n\nIn both versions, a piglin also drops a piglin head when killed in the vicinity of the explosion of a charged creeper.\n\nIf a piglin is killed in one hit while admiring a gold ingot, the gold ingot is dropped upon the piglin's death.\n\nAdults sometimes spawn with 1-4 pieces of armor, which can be: Golden Helmet Golden Chestplate Golden Leggings Golden Boots These have a chance of being enchanted.\n\nThese are dropped with an 8.5% chance and random durability.\n\nIn addition to their drops, piglins can also pick up other types of armor, including wearable items from the player.\n\nAdults drop 5 and an additional 1\u20133 per armor piece if killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nBaby piglins only drop 1.\n\nPiglins snort enviously while watching players holding a gold-related item or anything else.\n\nLike villagers, piglins can open and close wooden doors but cannot open fence gates, all trapdoors, and iron doors.\n\nPiglins cannot swim and can drown if submerged.\n\n[1] Unlike zombified variant, they are not naturally immune to fire or lava.\n\n[2] Idle piglins are afraid of zombified piglins, zoglins, soul fire, soul torches, soul lanterns, and lit soul campfires.\n\nIf a piglin comes within a certain distance of any of these things, it will squeal in fear and run away until the object or mob is out of its sight range.\n\nHostile piglins lose their fear of soul fire items, but they will still flee from zombified piglins and zoglins and will not approach the player if they are near either of these mobs.\n\nBaby piglins additionally retreat from wither skeletons and withers, but adult piglins will attack these on sight.\n\nCrossbow piglins do not reload their crossbows when spawned, unlike pillagers.\n\nThey reload only when provoked.\n\nBaby piglins are passive and play with baby hoglins, running around and riding upon them.\n\nUp to 3 baby piglins may stack on top of each other while riding a baby hoglin.\n\nThey can be given gold, but they do not give anything in return and run away.\n\nThey can also pick up and wear armor as well as hold gold tools or weapons.\n\nHowever, they are unable to pick up leather.\n\nIn addition, baby piglins never grow up.\n\n[3] If the player attacks a piglin, this action will not aggravate zombified piglins in the area.\n\nInfighting between these two mobs can start when an aggravated piglin carrying a crossbow shoots a zombified piglin by accident.\n\nWhen this happens, all nearby zombified piglins will become angry and pursue the piglin until it is either killed or runs out of their sight range.\n\nAdult piglins are neutral if the player is wearing at least one piece of golden armor.\n\nPiglins are provoked by any player who: Is not wearing any piece of gold armor.\n\nPiglins have short ranged detection for this.\n\nResults in light aggravation.\n\nAttacks the piglin.\n\nPiglins have long ranged detection for this.\n\nResults in heavy aggravation.\n\nAttacks another piglin or piglin brute, regardless of whether the player kills it in one hit or not.\n\nPiglins have long ranged detection for this.\n\nResults in medium aggravation.\n\nOpens a chest, trapped chest, ender chest, [4] shulker box, [5] barrel, minecart with chest, or boat with chest.\n\nPiglins have short ranged detection for this.\n\nResults in medium aggravation.\n\nBreaks a block of gold, gold ore, gilded blackstone, nether gold ore, block of raw gold, deepslate gold ore, or any of the blocks listed above.\n\nPiglins have medium ranged detection for this.\n\nResults in medium aggravation.\n\nIllustration of short range aggravation of piglins.\n\nNote the spherical range, and that piglins behind walls are not aggravated due to the line of sight being blocked.\n\nShort range: When a piglin has been aggravated by a player not wearing gold armor, or opening a container, piglins from up to around 15 blocks centered around the player become aggravated by the player if there is a straight line of sight to the player.\n\nMedium range: When a piglin has been aggravated by a player breaking a golden block or a container, piglins from up to 16 blocks from the player\u2019s feet become aggravated.\n\nNo line of sight is required.\n\nLong range: When a piglin has been aggravated by a player damaging a piglin or piglin brute, piglins from up to 16 blocks from the damaged piglin (rather than the player) become aggravated.\n\nNo line of sight is required.\n\nLight aggravation occurs when a piglin has been aggravated by a player not wearing gold armor.\n\nThe piglin can de-aggravate when the player puts on gold armor, distracts the piglin with gold, or the piglin loses a line of sight with the player.\n\nMedium aggravation occurs when a piglin has been aggravated by a player opening/breaking a container or breaking a golden block, or when a piglin witnesses a piglin brute or another piglin getting damaged by a player.\n\nPiglins under medium aggravation can be distracted with gold.\n\nA piglin already under light aggravation does not re-aggravate to medium aggravation.\n\nThis means that if a piglin knows a player broke a golden block near them after already going after them due to them not wearing gold armor, the player can de-aggravate that piglin by putting on gold armor or losing the line of sight despite the fact that the player broke the golden block.\n\nHeavy aggravation occurs if a piglin is damaged.\n\nThe damaged piglin cannot be distracted by gold and is unable to barter while under heavy aggravation.\n\nIf the player is under the influence of the Invisibility effect, they can open containers in front of piglins without aggravating them (short range), although breaking containers or golden blocks still angers them (mid/long range).\n\nPiglins do not react to the opening or breaking of furnace s, blast furnace s, smoker s, dropper s, dispenser s, or brewing stand s.\n\nOpening or breaking a hopper does not provoke the piglins.\n\n[6] Breaking a bell does not provoke them either, despite piglins admiring them as gold.\n\n[7] When a piglin is attacking, it holds its dominant arm and sword in front of it, similarly to a vindicator.\n\nAdult piglins are hostile toward wither skeletons and withers.\n\nThey congregate within 16 blocks and attack in hordes.\n\nWhen attacking with a crossbow, piglins shoot arrows every 2 seconds.\n\nIn Java Edition, they walk backward (stopping if at the edge of a drop) as soon as the target is close.\n\nIn Java Edition, their crossbows can break if it runs out of durability, [8] making the piglins use their fists, while in Bedrock Edition their crossbows never break.\n\n[9] Unlike mobs armed with bows, they do not strafe from left to right while shooting.\n\nPiglins with swords and other items rush at the target.\n\nIf a group of piglins successfully defeat their target, they gather at the site of their target's demise and emit \"celebration sounds\".\n\nHowever, piglins do not have a chance of dancing unless their target was a hoglin.\n\nWhen a mob attacks a piglin or piglin brute with no AI, other piglins nearby do not attack the mob that attacked the piglin or piglin brute with no AI.\n\nIron golems attack both adult and baby piglins; however, piglins do not attack iron golems without provocation.\n\nThe detection range of piglins is reduced to half of their normal range (17.5 blocks) when the player is wearing a piglin head.\n\nPiglin celebrating dance.\n\nPiglins sometimes attack hoglins, causing other piglins and piglin brutes [Bedrock Edition only ] in that area to attack the targeted hoglin as well.\n\nAdults do not immediately attack adult hoglins on sight, but a piglin has a random chance to make the decision to hunt a hoglin (this decision is almost never made if the piglin recently hunted, but other piglins can still start a hunt).\n\n[verify ] Once that piglin attacks the hoglin, all other piglins and piglin brutes [Bedrock Edition only ] in that area become hostile to the hoglin.\n\nIf outnumbered by hoglins, the piglins flee, making \"retreat\" sounds.\n\nAfter defeating a hoglin, piglins have a 10% chance to do a \"victory dance\" by bobbing their heads and sticking out their arms like a T-pose.\n\nThe more piglins there are, the bigger chance of a hunt might happen (because more piglins that detect the hoglin will each have a 10% chance of starting a hunt).\n\nAfter a hunt, any nearby piglins pick up the porkchops or cooked porkchops the hoglin dropped, but not the leather.\n\nPiglin brutes never pick up any porkchops or leather.\n\nPiglins that spawned as part of a bastion remnant during world generation do not hunt.\n\nPiglin brutes also join in hunts started by piglins, but do not start a hunt themselves. [Bedrock Edition only ] Piglins briefly stop attacking when given gold items.\n\nIf the player offers a gold ingot, bartering then takes place as it normally would.\n\nThey resume attacking once the barter is complete.\n\nIf the player distracts them with a gold item and equips a piece of gold armor while the piglin is examining the item, then the piglin ceases hostility.\n\nThey may also cease hostility if distracted enough times.\n\nIf the player breaks any gold-related block or hurts/kills a piglin, and then distracts the piglin up to 5 times with a piece of gold armor equipped, the piglin ceases hostility entirely.\n\nMain article: Bartering Adult piglins can trade gold ingots for certain items, when a gold ingot is dropped near them or the player uses it while looking at them.\n\nThe piglin proceeds to \"examine\" the ingot for six [JE only ] or eight [BE only ] [10] seconds, then drops a random item from the chart.\n\nHowever, baby piglins examine the ingot but instead run away without dropping an item.\n\nPiglins can also pick up items dropped by a dispenser or dropper.\n\nThe pool for what piglins can barter may be modified in a data pack  [JE only ].\n\nHowever, piglins can still barter while riding another mob.\n\nPiglins can pick up and equip any items they come across, preferring gold -related items, which they actively seek out.\n\nA piglin inspects any gold-related item before equipping, holding or putting that item in its inventory for six seconds after picking it up.\n\nHowever, items not related to gold are held or equipped (if the piglin does not have any gold equipment) instantly.\n\nPiglins do not pick up any items if the / gamerule mobGriefing is set to false.\n\nPiglins pick up raw porkchops and cooked porkchops that are within 1 block from them, unless they have done so within the last 10 seconds.\n\nPiglins have eight hidden inventory slots in which they can stack items.\n\nPiglins with full inventories do not attempt to pick up gold-related items, except gold ingots.\n\nBaby piglins attempt to pick up any item and do not give the player any items in exchange for gold ingots.\n\nAdult piglins can pick up gold nuggets (which do not help to obtain better items from bartering but are immediately placed in their inventory), porkchops, and cooked porkchops (they do not actively seek out and contemplate porkchops).\n\nPiglins drop any of these items upon death aside from gold ingots, raw porkchops, and cooked porkchops.\n\nWhen a piglin is admiring a gold ingot while bartering, it does not run away from nearby zoglins or nearby zombified piglins.\n\nPiglins with crossbows can pick up other crossbows and equip them.\n\nLike other mobs capable of picking up items, piglins pick up armor and weapons.\n\nPiglins pick up armor that is better than the armor they are already wearing, although they prefer gold over stronger armor.\n\nFor example, a piglin does not pick up leather boots if it is already wearing diamond boots, but may discard a netherite chestplate to pick up a golden chestplate.\n\nHowever, they cannot unequip and discard armor with Curse of Binding.\n\nPiglins that spawned in a bastion remnant during world generation, or that have picked up items or equipment, do not despawn naturally.\n\nItems picked up by a piglin do not drop when the piglin is killed.\n\nItems that piglins want are listed under the piglin_loved tag with the exception of gold nuggets, which piglins pick up instantly to trigger the advancement / achievement \"O(oo)h Shiny!\".\n\nPiglins do not want any other items, even if they are related to gold in some way.\n\nBell Block of gold Block of raw gold Clock Deepslate gold ore Enchanted golden apple Gilded blackstone Glistering melon slice Gold ingot (piglins barter something else in return) Gold nugget Gold ore Golden apple Golden axe Golden boots (worn after being examined) Golden carrot Golden chestplate (worn after being examined) Golden helmet (worn after being examined) Golden hoe Golden horse armor Golden leggings (worn after being examined) Golden pickaxe Golden shovel Golden sword (equipped if piglin is using a non-gold weapon or crossbow, or does not already have one) Light weighted pressure plate Nether gold ore Powered rail  [Bedrock Edition only ] [11] Raw gold A piglin turning into a zombified piglin.\n\nWhen in the Overworld and the End, piglins transform into zombified piglins after 15 seconds, retaining their armor, held items and their name.\n\nHowever, they cannot shoot a crossbow, using it as a melee weapon instead.\n\nUpon transformation, the spawned zombified piglin has the Nausea effect for 10 seconds; this is just a cosmetic effect.\n\nWhen a piglin transforms into a zombified piglin, it drops anything except equipped weapons and armor in its inventory; other items in its inventory disappear.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, if the game is set to Peaceful difficulty, the piglin despawns instead of transforming because hostile mobs do not exist in Peaceful difficulty.\n\nA piglin that returns to the Nether before 15 seconds remains unchanged, although the 15-second portal cooldown usually prevents them from returning during that time.\n\nA piglin does not zombify outside the Nether if its IsImmuneToZombification tag is set to true.\n\nPiglins with their NoAI tag set to true also do not zombify.\n\nIn Java Edition, if a piglin is inspecting/admiring a gold ingot or a gold-related item and then gets zombified while inspecting, it drops the gold ingot or the gold-related item.\n\nJava Edition: Piglins use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b c MC-98316 \u2014 Wrong subtitles caused by missing distinction \u2191 idle1 and idle2 are 0.7;

    "content": "This article is about the hostile mob in Minecraft.\n\nFor the hostile mob in Minecraft Dungeons, see:MCD:Pillager.\n\nNot to be confused with Villager, Witch or Illager.\n\nSee also: Raid captain Pillager Pillager Aiming Pillager (BE) Aiming (BE) Health 24 \u00d7 12 Classification Illager Behavior Hostile Passive (only if its crossbow is broken) Spawn Patrols Pillager outposts Raids Damage Ranged Easy: 3.5 \u00d7 1.75 Normal: 4 Hard: 4.5 \u00d7 2.25 Melee  [BE only ] Easy: 2 Normal: 3 Hard: 5 Details Size In Java Edition: Height: 1.95 Blocks Width: 0.6 Blocks In Bedrock Edition: Height: 1.9 Blocks Width: 0.6 Blocks Pillagers are hostile mobs armed with crossbows found in wandering patrols, in pillager outposts, or as participants in raids.\n\nThey attack by firing arrows at the player.\n\nIn Java Edition, a pillager spawned by a player using a spawn egg or commands can be a captain which has an ominous banner sticking out of its head.\n\nIn Java Edition, the number of pillagers spawning in each patrol varies from one to five and depends on the regional difficulty, with one spawning as a patrol captain.\n\nPatrols occur after 5 1 \u2044 2 in-game days, any time and independently of structures, which means they still spawn in worlds without generated structures.\n\nA patrol spawns 24 to 48 blocks away from a random player, on the highest solid block.\n\nThe individual pillagers of a patrol can spawn only at block light level less than 9, regardless of sky light.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, each patrol spawns two to five pillagers.\n\nOne of these pillagers is a patrol captain.\n\nAfter 5 1 \u2044 2 in-game days, patrols appear 24 to 48 blocks away from the player, at a light level of 7 and below on Easy or any light level on Normal and Hard difficulty.\n\nPillagers continually spawn in a 72\u00d754\u00d772 block volume centered on the top floor in a pillager outpost.\n\nSome pillagers spawn as outpost captains.\n\nThey may spawn on any valid opaque block if the block light level is less than or equal to 8.\n\nIn Java Edition, there can be unlimited pillagers that spawn in outposts naturally, limited only by the natural spawning rules.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, pillagers continually spawn at or below a particular location in the outpost, choosing the highest opaque block with a non-solid block on top and spawning on the northwest corner.\n\nA maximum of eight pillagers spawn naturally in an outpost.\n\nIn a raid, pillagers are more common in the earlier waves and decrease in number as the waves progress.\n\nDespite this, they still constitute the majority of raiders in total.\n\nOne pillager spawns riding a ravager in the fifth wave.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, one of the ravagers is ridden by a pillager instead of a vindicator on the seventh wave.\n\nIn Java Edition, pillagers spawn during bonus waves and have the largest chance of being the raid captain in the first wave, but in the second wave and onwards, vindicators have a greater chance than pillagers of being the raid captain.\n\nA pillager drops upon death: In Bedrock Edition, pillagers drop 0 - 2 arrow s.\n\nEach level of the Looting enchantment increases the maximum number of arrows dropped for up to five.\n\nThere is a 8.5% chance to drop a crossbow when killed by the player or a tamed wolf.\n\nThe crossbow may be loaded or unloaded depending on the crossbow's state when the pillager dies.\n\nThe drop chance increases by 1% per level of Looting.\n\nThe crossbow is of a random durability and has a chance of being enchanted.\n\nThe chance ranges from 0% to 10% depending on the regional difficulty.\n\nThe enchantment level is from 5 to 19.\n\n5 experience points and an additional 1\u20133 points per naturally-spawned equipment when killed by the player or a tamed wolf.\n\nIts illager ominous banner if spawned as a captain.\n\n1 Ominous Bottle which gives Bad Omen I-V if spawned as a captain.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, pillagers that were spawned by raids have a 6% chance on easy and normal or 80% chance on hard difficulties to drop these: 0\u20131 Emerald (10 \u2044 39 or 25.6%) 2\u20133 Emerald (5 \u2044 39 or 12.8%) 4\u20135 Emerald (2 \u2044 39 or 5.1%) 1 Enchanted Book (2 \u2044 39 or 5.1%) 1 Iron Pickaxe (5 \u2044 78 or 6.4%) 1 Iron Axe (5 \u2044 78 or 6.4%) 1 Iron Shovel (5 \u2044 78 or 6.4%) 1 Iron Sword (5 \u2044 78 or 6.4%) 1 Iron Helmet (5 \u2044 78 or 6.4%) 1 Iron Chestplate (5 \u2044 78 or 6.4%) 1 Iron Leggings (5 \u2044 78 or 6.4%) 1 Iron Boots (5 \u2044 78 or 6.4%) The iron equipment drops have a 50% chance to be enchanted at level 5 to 19.\n\nSaid equipment may also have enchantment combinations that cannot be normally obtained, such as Blast Protection and Fire Protection on the same pair of boots.\n\nIron equipment drops are always of 30 to 90% item durability.\n\nThese drops are affected by the Looting enchantment.\n\nEnchanted books have level 30 enchantments, which can also be treasure enchantments.\n\nSpecial loot chances of dropping Easy and normal modes Hard mode An emerald: 8.32% 10.24% 2-3 emeralds: 8.32% 10.24% 4-5 emeralds: 3.33% 4.102% An enchanted book: 3.33% 4.102% An iron equipment: 4.16% 5.12% Pillagers are hostile toward players, iron golems, wandering traders and adult villagers.\n\nPillagers also aid other pillagers attacked by other mobs.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a pillager that accidentally harms a vindicator or evoker causes it to retaliate and attack the pillager.\n\nIn Java Edition, pillagers do not retaliate on vindicators or evokers that attack them.\n\nA passive pillager holding an ominous banner in the right hand.\n\nWhen a player is in Creative mode or applied with the Invisibility effect, getting near a pillager still causes it to take notice and stare at the player.\n\nIf a pillager notices an enemy while staring at the player, the pillager stops staring and attacks the enemy.\n\nIf a player with the invisibility effect attacks a pillager, the pillager still retaliates.\n\nA pillager attacks by shooting arrows from its crossbows every three seconds from up to eight blocks away and pursues enemies for up to 64 blocks in Java Edition or 16 blocks in Bedrock Edition.\n\nPillagers move slowly when wandering or loading crossbows in Java Edition.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, pillagers move from one place to another as fast as when they're provoked, although they stop and look around, pointing their crossbows along.\n\nPillagers point their crossbows at any player or mob they are looking at, whether their crossbows are loaded or unloaded.\n\nA pillager stares at the player and points its crossbow toward the player when the player is in creative mode or when the player has the invisibility status effect.\n\nThe patrol captain wears an ominous banner, known as the illager banner in Bedrock and Education Editions, on its head.\n\nThe other illagers follow the captain around.\n\nThe pillagers that are part of a patrol do not attack immediately.\n\nThe patrol members' heads turn to follow the player or mob who attracted their attention.\n\nIf the player or villager-like mob attacks or approaches within ten blocks of the patrol members, then this provokes them into loading their crossbows and attacking.\n\n[1] If raiding pillagers kill all the villagers in a village, they celebrate their victory by jumping and laughing.\n\nUnarmed pillagers also cheer.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, pillagers wave their arms while holding their crossbows in their main hand when cheering.\n\nPillagers can take and equip illager banners within 3 blocks, but non-raider pillagers do not search for ominous banners.\n\nIn Java Edition, if a pillager gets attacked by a mob (excluding illagers and goats) or player, it will alert other pillagers to target the attacker unless the pillager was killed in one hit.\n\nPillagers can also use crossbows in their off-hand.\n\nWhen a pillager finds a target, the pillager chases the target, then locks the target in its attack range and loads its crossbow.\n\nPillagers with their crossbows loaded can attack at any blocks away if the target is out of their attack range.\n\nPillagers, unlike evokers or vindicators, attack on sight, not regarding distance, although attacking a pillager, vindicator or evoker far away causes the attacked illager and the same type of illagers around the attacked illager to attack the player regardless of distance.\n\nThe command /summon pillager ~ ~ ~ {} summons a passive pillager that does not attack.\n\nA pillager's crossbow eventually breaks with repeated use, unlike weapons wielded by other mobs.\n\n[2] Unarmed pillagers are passive toward the player, iron golems and villagers, but they still frighten villagers and iron golems are still hostile toward them.\n\nThis also includes pillagers that don't have a crossbow, which means any pillagers with a sword or any weapon other than a crossbow are still passive.\n\nAn unarmed pillager always faces any player in its field of view or any mob that attacks it.\n\nA pillager spawned with arrows or firework rockets in its off-hand slot will use them, depleting the stack over time and switching to regular arrows once running out of ammo.\n\n[3] When firing firework rockets, pillagers will aim above the target as when using arrows, despite rockets being unaffected by gravity.\n\n[4] If a pillager's arrow hits a neutral or hostile mob by accident, the mob attacks the pillager.\n\nPillagers cannot use their crossbows in their off-hand, as mobs cannot use weapons in their off-hand, just like players.\n\nThe different of the pillagers texture in Java (left) and Bedrock (right) Edition.\n\nPillagers use an outdated behavior.\n\n[5] [6] They also have different arm textures.\n\n[7] Pillagers load their crossbows upon spawning or if their crossbows are unloaded.\n\nWhen a pillager finds a target, it loads its crossbow first, chases the target and attacks upon in range.\n\nPillagers are not hostile to players before their crossbows are loaded, so sometimes they don't look at players or run around while loading their crossbows.\n\nA dispenser can equip a pillager with armor.\n\nHowever, an armor item isn't rendered on pillagers.\n\nIf a player summons a pillager without a crossbow by spawn event command, it still shoots arrows to attack targets, like other arrow-shooting ranged mobs.\n\nThis is due to the fact that in the pillager.json and ranged piglin.json files, the component_groups have both minecraft:behavior.ranged_attack and minecraft:behavior.charge_held_item, so if a pillager does not have a crossbow, the charge_held_item behavior cannot trigger and it continuously shoots arrows due to the ranged_attack behavior.\n\nUnlike in Java Edition, the crossbows of pillagers in Bedrock Edition don't break.\n\n[8] Pillagers use a melee attack while underwater, unlike pillagers in Java Edition that maintain using crossbows underwater, although the shot arrows travel slower underwater and sink after a short distance.\n\nA player receives the Bad Omen status effect by drinking an Ominous Potion.\n\nThe effect lasts for 100 minutes (five in-game days) and can be removed by drinking milk.\n\nWhen a player afflicted with Bad Omen enters a village, a raid commences in that village, bringing about waves of illagers that seek and try to kill all villagers.\n\nEach patrol spawns one pillager captain.\n\nWhile outposts can continually spawn pillager captains, each captain inflicts the player who killed it with one level of Bad Omen upon death.\n\nRaid captains do not inflict Bad Omen when defeated in a raid.\n\nIn Java Edition, killing multiple captains in succession raises the Bad Omen level to a maximum of V, increasing the chance of pillagers and vindicators in the resulting raid wielding enchanted weapons.\n\nAs long as the Bad Omen level is higher than I, the resulting raid includes an additional wave with a raider composition identical to that of the last wave.\n\nJava Edition: Pillagers use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: \u2191 Due to a typo, the third sound for pillager celebrating is unused.\n\nSee MCPE-121058.\n\nJava Edition: Bedrock Edition: Pillagers have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Tags common to all mobs spawnable in raids Inventory: Each compound tag in this list is an item in the pillager's inventory, up to a maximum of 5 slots.\n\nItems in two or more slots that can be stacked together are automatically be condensed into one slot.\n\nPillagers don't

orbs out of all non-boss entities.\n\nRavagers are hostile toward players, iron golems, adult villagers, and wandering traders within a 32-block radius.\n\nThey attack by ramming enemies with their head, dealing a knockback of 5 blocks.\n\nRavagers also attack by opening and closing their mouths, similar to biting their target.\n\nWhen ravagers see a villager and an iron golem together, they always prioritize villagers unless they are already attacking an iron golem.\n\nThey can also destroy certain block types by charging into them.\n\nIn Java Edition, ravagers can only break leaves and crops.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, they can break leaves, all crops, any other non-tree plants, mushrooms, and turtle eggs.\n\nHere is the complete list: Although ravagers are equipped with saddles, they cannot be ridden by the player.\n\nRavagers will only naturally appear ridden by an illager.\n\nHowever, another mob can be allowed to ride a ravager using the /ride command.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition ravagers have delayed hits hit_delay_pct: 0.5.\n\nWhen set to 0.0, ravager hits wouldn't be delayed to match Java Edition.\n\nWhen its bite attack is blocked by a shield, no damage is dealt and knockback is halved.\n\nA ravager also has a 50% chance to become stunned and unable to move or attack for 2 seconds.\n\nAfter this period, it will open its mouth and roar, dealing 6 damage and a knockback of 5 blocks to nearby entities.\n\nThe roar knocks back nearby illagers without damaging them and has no effect on other ravagers (note that vexes and witches are not treated as illagers and will take both damage and knockback).\n\nIllagers that are knocked back by a ravager's roar can still take fall damage.\n\nRavagers do not attack pillagers who shoot at them by accident, and do not attack evokers when evoker fangs accidentally hit them.\n\nWhen a vindicator riding a ravager has been named \"Johnny\" it may attack the ravager while it is riding it, but the ravager does not attack the vindicator for any reason.\n\nWhen a ravager gets shot by a mob that battles with a projectile while it is attacking the player, the ravager first attempts to kill who shot it, then goes back to attacking the player once the deed is done.\n\nAny mob that doesn't battle with projectiles requires a ravagers to roar in order to aggro on it.\n\nIn Java Edition, a ravager who gets attacked by a mob (excluding illagers or goats) or player will alert other ravagers to target the attacker unless the ravager was killed in one hit.\n\nRavagers take 75% less of knockback, but they still float in water.\n\nA ravager being ridden dismounts its rider if it moves into water two blocks deep.\n\nRiders cannot mount ravagers again after being dismounted.\n\nIn Java Edition, any ravager can join a

although \"behemoth\" was also considered.\n\n[3] Ravagers were mainly inspired by the manticore, particularly the version from Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n[4] Ravagers have a vaguely bovine appearance, and are jokingly described as \"a spicy cow\" on the Minecraft.net page.\n\n[4] However, they cannot be milked.\n\nSeveral ravager sounds are altered versions of the sounds of other mobs: The first and third ravager death sounds (https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Ravager_death1.ogg and https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Ravager_death3.ogg) are versions of the first pillager death sound

Passive (Peaceful difficulty) Spawn End city Damage 4 Levitation: Levitation for 10 seconds Usable items Dye  [Bedrock Edition only ] Details Size Closed: Height: 1 Block Width: 1 Block Peeking: Height: 1.2 Blocks Width: 1 Block Open: Height: 2 Blocks Width: 1 Block Armor 20 (\u00d7 10) when closed, 0 () when opened A shulker is a box-shaped hostile mob found in end cities.\n\nIt hides in its shell to protect itself and blend in with its surroundings.\n\nIt attacks by shooting homing bullets at the player which inflict Levitation.\n\nIt is the only source of shulker shells, which are used to craft shulker boxes.\n\nShulkers spawn during the generation of end cities, which are located on the outer islands of the End.\n\nThey usually spawn on the walls of the city and on end ships.\n\nThey do not despawn naturally, even in Peaceful difficulty.\n\nThere is a chance that a new shulker of the same color will spawn when a shulker is hit with a shulker bullet (including one of its own).\n\nThe following conditions need to be met: When the shulker gets hit and then has less than half its health remaining, there is a 25% chance it will try to teleport without spawning a new shulker instead of checking the conditions below.\n\nThe hit shulker must have its lid open.\n\nThe hit shulker needs to find somewhere to teleport.\n\nFor this, it takes a random block in a 17\u00d717\u00d717 cuboid centered on the shulker and then checks if the block has a valid face to teleport to.\n\nIf not it proceeds to try this up to 4 more times.\n\nIf no valid face is found, the attempt fails.\n\nEach other shulker within 8 blocks of the hit shulker decreases the odds of success by 20%.\n\nWhen five or more other shulkers are nearby, no shulkers will spawn, but the hit shulker still teleports.\n\nIf the attempt succeeds a new shulker spawns where the old shulker was before it teleported.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, shulkers drop 0\u20131 shulker shells.\n\nThe maximum can be increased by 1 per level of Looting, which is 0\u20134 shells with Looting III.\n\nIn Java Edition, shulkers have a 50% chance of dropping a shulker shell when killed.\n\nThis is increased by 6.25% per level of Looting, for a maximum of 68.75% with Looting III.\n\nShulkers also drop 5 when killed by a player or a tamed wolf.\n\nThe shell of the mob looks similar to a purpur block, blending in to its natural surroundings.\n\nInside the shell of the mob is a small yellow head with two eyes.\n\nShulkers are uncolored by default when using spawn eggs, while white is the default when using / summon or spawners.\n\nSpawning shulkers with other colors can be done using the / summon command, as detailed below.\n\nShulkers generally remain stationary, attached to an adjacent block with a full face.\n\n[1] However, if the block the shulker occupies becomes something other than air or the shulker finds itself not adjacent to any full face, or the shell cannot fully open (due to solid blocks or entities such as boats or other shulkers), it attempts to teleport (5 attempts per tick) to an air block within a 17\u00d717\u00d717 cube centered on the shulker where the shulker can attach to a full face and open.\n\nIf it finds no valid position to teleport onto it does not move.\n\nShulkers evaluate the collision box of scaffolding based on their current position, [2] which can result in the shulker teleporting to a position only to find it invalid and teleport again.\n\nShulkers occasionally open their shell for 1\u20133 seconds.\n\nWhen a target comes within about 16 blocks, it opens fully and shoots guided projectiles that follow the player, called shulker bullets, moving only along the X, Y, or Z axes and leaving trails of white particles.\n\nThe projectiles can be destroyed by attacking them or blocked with a shield.\n\nIf the projectile hits an entity, it does 4 of damage and inflicts the Levitation status effect for 10 seconds, this status effect has no effect underwater [3]  [Java Edition only ], or while riding a mob.\n\nThe shulker continues firing every 1\u20135.5 seconds while the target remains in range.\n\nIf the shulker's target dies with projectiles still in flight, they fall to the ground.\n\nShulkers can attack each other, in which case they shoot fully guided bullets at each other, but are unaffected by Levitation when hit.\n\nThe normal teleportation habits apply during these battles, and is likely to result in the duplication of more shulkers.\n\nWhen its shell is closed, a shulker has 20 (\u00d7 10) armor points and deflects arrows.\n\nWhen the shell opens, it loses this natural armor and takes damage as normal.\n\nWhen at less than half health, a shulker has a 25% chance of teleporting (as described above) after taking damage.\n\nWhen a shulker is attacked, other shulkers in the area target the attacker as well.\n\nShulkers don't take burning damage from lava or fire.\n\nThey drown in water, but try to teleport away when water or lava flows into the block they occupy.\n\nIn Peaceful difficulty, shulkers exist within the world, but do not attack, [4] like vindicators, evokers and piglin brutes in Bedrock Edition.\n\nShulkers are treated differently than true blocks.\n\nFor example, mobs are unable to pathfind around [5] or jump over them, [6] and falling on them from a height does not produce particles.\n\n[7] Their spawn egg also does not destroy blocks such as grass.\n\n[8] In Bedrock Edition, they apply Levitation II instead of I.\n\nShulkers spawned as part of a team using / summon attack most hostile mobs without provocation.\n\nThey never attack their teammates intentionally and do not retaliate even when being hit, however the shulkers will still target players without a team or in another team.\n\nShulker bullet Behavior Does not exist Details Size Height: 0.3125 Blocks Width: 0.3125 Blocks A shulker bullet is a guided projectile that is shot from shulkers, and they follow the targeted entity along the X, Y, or Z axis and leave trails of white particles.\n\nA shulker bullet that hits a mob or player deals damage and affects them with Levitation for ten seconds.\n\nThe shulker's projectiles also have entity data that control its movement.\n\nThe bullet can be destroyed by hitting it with any item, shooting it with an arrow, or blocking it with a shield.\n\nIt explodes upon contact with a block.\n\nThe explosion does not destroy any blocks and does not damage nearby mobs or players.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, shulkers can be dyed in a similar fashion to sheep.\n\nUsing a dye on a shulker gives it the color of the dye.\n\nIn Java Edition, the color of a shulker is changed through commands using the color byte tag.\n\nA shulker is transported in the Overworld by boat.\n\nPistons raise the boat uphill.\n\nShulkers can be moved by boats or minecarts; pushing a boat/cart into a shulker causes it to board.\n\nA boat's sides block some of a shulkers projectiles.\n\nA shulker pushed through the exit portal gets transported to the world spawn point in the Overworld.\n\nSince shulkers teleport when not adjacent to a solid block, they must be pushed down the central pillar of the exit portal (or a manually placed block directly above the portal) with a piston.\n\nJava Edition: Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Shulker bullets use

were simply made to be a similar shade of purple to purpur.\n\n[9] The word \"shulker\" is a portmanteau of \"shell lurker\".\n\n[10] [11] A shulker named ' Dinnerbone ' or ' Grumm ' flips

In Bedrock Edition:' Height: 1.9 blocks.\n\nWidth: 0.6 blocks Skeletons are undead common hostile mobs that perform ranged attacks with a bow by shooting arrows.\n\nA skeleton may spawn above a solid block at a light level of zero in the Overworld except in mushroom fields and deep dark biomes, usually in small groups of up to four skeletons in Java Edition or two skeletons in Bedrock Edition.\n\n80% of skeletons spawned directly under the sky in snowy plains, ice spikes, frozen oceans, deep frozen oceans and legacy frozen oceans biomes spawn as stray mobs.\n\nSpiders have a very low chance of 1% to spawn with a skeleton riding them, creating a spider jockey.\n\nFour skeleton horsemen spawn when a skeleton horse trap is triggered, typically during a thunderstorm.\n\nThe skeletons ride on skeleton horses and are equipped with enchanted bows and iron helmets and, in Java Edition, have damage immunity for 3 seconds after spawning.\n\nSkeletons spawn from 25% of the monster spawners found in monster rooms.\n\nSkeletons spawn commonly in soul sand valleys, biomes of the Nether.\n\nHowever, existing skeletons lower the spawning chances of other hostile mobs nearby, meaning there are much less skeletons in a given area compared to zombified piglins in nether wastes.\n\nIn nether fortresses structures, there is a 20% chance that a skeleton spawns in place of a wither skeleton.\n\nA skeleton drops upon death: From zero to two bone s.\n\nThe maximum drop is increased by one per level of Looting, for a maximum of zero to five bones with Looting at the level three.\n\nFrom zero to two arrow s.\n\nThe maximum drop is increased by one per level of Looting, for a maximum of zero to five arrows with Looting at the level three.\n\nAny naturally spawned equipment, naturally its damaged and sometimes enchanted bow, has an 8.5% chance of dropping if killed by the player or a tamed wolf (9.5% with Looting one, 10.5% with Looting two and 11.5% with Looting three).\n\nPicked-up items always drop and drop with the same damage level it had when picked up.\n\nA skeleton skull if killed by a charged creeper 's explosion.\n\n5 experience orbs when killed by a player or a tamed wolf, and an extra 1\u20133 experience orbs for each piece of natural equipment that does not drop upon death.\n\nBecause all skeletons spawn with at least a bow, this leaves an unarmored skeleton dropping 6\u20138 experience orbs if it doesn't drop its bow upon death.\n\nIf the skeleton does drop its bow, it drops the default 5 experience orbs instead.\n\nSkeletons chase players, baby turtles and iron golems they see within 16 blocks, climbing stairs or ladders, navigating mazes and traversing other complex obstacles to get within their shooting range.\n\nA skeleton shooting.\n\nWhen within 15 blocks of a target and with a clear line of sight, the skeleton starts shooting with arrows, once every two seconds on easy and normal difficulties or once every second on hard difficulty.\n\nIf the player leaves the 15-block radius, skeletons wait for some seconds with the bow charged, shooting the moment the player comes within range again.\n\nTheir detection range is reduced by 50% if a skeleton skull is worn by the player.\n\nThis stacks with sneaking and the Invisibility effect.\n\nThe skeleton's accuracy is based on the world difficulty.\n\nSkeletons have an \"error\" of 10 on Easy, 6 on Normal and 2 on Hard.\n\nThis is compared to the player's lack of accuracy of 1.\n\nTo account for gravity, skeletons aim 0.2 blocks higher for every horizontal block of range to the target.\n\nSkeletons have infinite durability on their bows, and can shoot an infinite amount of arrows.\n\nArrows shot by skeletons cannot be picked up from the ground.\n\nSkeleton behavior varies between the game editions: Java Edition Strafe in circular patterns to dodge attacks and retreat to a safe range if the player comes within 4 blocks.\n\nThey sometimes walk off cliffs while strafing.\n\n[1] Sprint toward the player if they are 14 blocks away or farther.\n\nUse bows even underwater.\n\nThe water slows down the arrows.\n\nAnimates its bow while attacking.\n\nBedrock Edition Skeletons typically stop moving to shoot, making no attempt to avoid being hit.\n\nAn underwater skeleton uses a melee attack because it is unable to use a bow underwater.\n\nA skeleton on land shoots quickly at a player in water.\n\nThe rate of fire increases as the player approaches, making combat difficult due to the knockback.\n\nIn most cases, if a skeleton's arrow hits a neutral or hostile mob that has not yet been attacked by the player, the mob attacks the skeleton.\n\nWhen a skeleton is attacked by another mob (including another skeleton), it attacks that mob, reorienting on the player once the mob is dead.\n\nSkeletons flee from wolves.\n\nA skeleton runs from a chasing wolf until the wolf deals damage, after which the skeleton turns to shoot at the wolf that successfully attacked it.\n\nDueling skeletons.\n\nOne skeleton turned red from being shot by the other skeleton.\n\nSkeletons sink in water and cannot swim, but do not drown.\n\nIf a skeleton is inside of powder snow for 7 seconds, it converts into a stray.\n\nA newly-converted stray always has full health even if converted from a damaged skeleton.\n\nThe converted stray keeps any items worn or held when it was a skeleton.\n\nOnly skeletons can become strays; wither skeletons cannot be converted.\n\nWolves attacking a skeleton.\n\nIf spawned with a weapon other than a bow, or no weapon at all (which can be spawned with commands such as / summon skeleton ~ ~ ~ {HandItems:[{Count:1,id:\"iron_sword\"}]}, or / summon skeleton ~ ~ ~ {}), a skeleton charges at a player with arms outstretched and deals damage by touch, similar to a wither skeleton.\n\nA skeleton holding a tipped arrow in its off-hand always shoots that type of arrow, and the arrow held is not consumed.\n\nIf a creeper dies from a skeleton's arrow, it drops one of any music discs except for Pigstep, Otherside, 5, and Relic.\n\nA skeleton burning in sunlight.\n\nSkeletons burn at dawn when the sun is 15 degrees or greater above the ground and when the moon can no longer be seen, unless the skeleton is: Below an opaque block.\n\nIn a sunlight level of 11 or less.\n\nIn water.\n\nStanding in soul sand.\n\nAffected by Fire Resistance.\n\nWearing a helmet, which absorbs the damage, wearing out completely after a long time, usually several day cycles.\n\nStanding in cobwebs.\n\n[2] If not wearing a helmet, it seeks out shade during the day or enters water to protect itself.\n\nUnlike zombies, which leave the shade to chase a player, skeletons do not exit the shaded area even while attacking.\n\nSkeletons are undead mobs, causing them to be damaged by the Instant Health status effect, healed by the Instant Damage status effect, and unaffected by the status effects Regeneration and Poison.\n\nSkeletons are ignored by the wither and are affected by the Smite enchantment.\n\nSome spawned skeletons have the ability to pick up dropped items from the ground.\n\nUnlike zombies, however, they pick up only weapons or armor.\n\nIf a picked up item is armor, a carved pumpkin or a mob head, a skeleton equips itself with the item.\n\nIf the picked up item is a weapon, the skeleton uses the item as a melee weapon.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, skeletons can also pick up and equip illager banners worn in their chest slot.\n\nSkeletons spawn already-armed with bows, which may be enchanted.\n\nThe chances of that event are listed below from code.\n\nIf a skeleton spawns wearing multiple pieces of armor, the armor is never mismatched (all pieces are made of the same material) except if it is spawned as part of a skeleton trap, in which case only the iron helmet may not match the rest of the armor.\n\n\u2191 a b c d e f g h i Value is based on the regional difficulty.\n\n\u2191 100% chance of a bow \u2191 a b Enchantment is the same as on an enchantment table at level 5\u201322.\n\n[note 1] If a skeleton does spawn with armor, the chances of specific armor are as follows: In Java Edition, the armor pieces go from feet to head, and in Bedrock Edition, they go from head to feet.\n\nThe chances of it being of a particular material are: The armor is not damaged from most damage sources; it cannot \"wear out\" the way player armor does.\n\nHelmets (not blocks like carved pumpkins) on skeletons can break if the skeleton is exposed to daylight or has an anvil or other falling block dropped on its hitbox.\n\nIf a skeleton has a bow and a sword is given, it drops the bow, with the same chance as if killed with Looting I and starts using the sword.\n\nIf a skeleton has a sword or bow in its hand, and one of a better type or with better enchantments is given, the skeleton drops the existing weapon, with the same chance as if killed with Looting I in favor of the better one.\n\nAny skeleton that spawns with equipment (picked-up items do not count) gives 1\u20133 extra experience points per item.\n\nIf multiple viable items exist, the skeleton endlessly picks up and drops the items.\n\n[3] On Halloween, skeletons may spawn wearing a carved pumpkin or jack o'lantern.\n\nThey do not drop this, even when killed with Looting.\n\nJava Edition: Skeletons use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: \u2191 MCPE-53297 Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Skeletons have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs StrayConversionTime: The number of ticks until this skeleton converts to a stray (default value is -1, when no conversion is under way).\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nHistorical sounds: Issues relating to \"Skeleton\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nIf alerted to a player 's presence, a skeleton can fire arrows backward, occasionally hitting themselves.\n\nSkeletons cannot see the player through glass, fences, or other transparent blocks.\n\nSkeletons and their variants do not know how to use a crossbow, despite the same using method as a bow.\n\nThe artificial intelligence of skeletons in Bedrock Edition is a mix of skeleton AI from Java Edition between versions 1.5 and 1.8.9 and the skeletons in Update Aquatic.\n\nThey shoot faster when they are on land and the target underwater, causing knockback enough to make combat hard.\n\nAdditionally, they do not strafe left to right, and they shoot more rapidly at closer targets.\n\nSkeletons also use ranged attacks on land and switch to melee attacks when sinking underwater.\n\nIn Java Edition, 89% of skeletons hold their bow in their right hand and 11% with the left.\n\nThis reflects estimated handedness percentages in the real world.\n\nIf a skeleton has a sword or any other melee item, generally with commands, its AI resembles the wither skeleton 's AI.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, skeletons do not animate their bow.\n\nC418 used bamboo wind chime sounds as a base for the skeleton sounds.\n\n[5] This page would benefit from the addition of

[Java Edition only ] Killing a baby skeleton horse yields no items or experience.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, killing a trap skeleton horse also yields no items or experience.\n\nSee also: Transportation Skeleton horses can be used as one of the fastest means of transportation in the game, though they are unable to fit through single block-wide openings.\n\nWhen ridden, they can also be used to climb hills and jump fences because the skeleton horses can jump up to five block heights, versus the player's maximum of one (without jump boost).\n\nThey can be ridden in water in any depth, and do so faster than non-skeleton horses.\n\nSkeleton horses sink in the water and can be ridden along the ocean or river floor.\n\nSkeleton horses can be pulled using a lead.\n\nGUI of a skeleton horse. [JE only ] Java Edition Skeleton horses have the following slot available: Saddle Slot: For equipping a saddle.\n\nSaddles can be placed on a tamed skeleton horse by holding it and then using on the skeleton horse, or by accessing its inventory.\n\nA skeleton horse's inventory can be accessed by mounting the skeleton horse and using inventory control, or by sneaking and then using on the skeleton horse.\n\nBaby skeleton horses cannot be equipped.\n\nBedrock Edition A skeleton horse does not have an inventory and cannot be equipped with a saddle or armor.\n\nDespite this, the default texture file, like those of normal horses, donkeys and mules, includes a chest.\n\nMain article: Riding In Bedrock Edition, skeleton horses can be controlled by the player without a saddle.\n\nHowever, in Java Edition, skeleton horses can be equipped with a saddle and then controlled.\n\nLike riding other entities, it is impossible for a player to use a nether portal or end portal while on a skeleton horse.\n\nThe player can control a tamed (and saddled Java Edition) skeleton horse with standard directional controls, jump, and the mouse.\n\nThe player dismounts using the dismount control.\n\nA player controlled skeleton horse automatically runs up any one block high slope.\n\nThe skeleton horse and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high.\n\nLower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block.\n\nThe horse itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks.\n\nSkeleton horses cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.\n\nPlayer controlled skeleton horses have the ability of \"jumping charging\".\n\nWhen the player rides them, the experience bar on HUD is replaced by jumping charging bar.\n\nA controlled skeleton horses can be made to jump and holding the control charges for a higher leap.\n\nSkeleton horses are not affected by jump boost beacons or potions.\n\nUnlike normal horses, a skeleton horse does not force the player to dismount when it is under water;

1 \u2044 10 of all chunks.\n\nIn Java Edition, these \"slime chunks\" are determined pseudo-randomly by combining their chunk coordinates with the seed of the world: import java.util.Random; public class checkSlimechunk {public static boolean isSlimeChunk (long worldSeed, int xPosition, int zPosition) {Random rnd = new Random (worldSeed + (int) (xPosition * xPosition * 0x4c1906) + (int) (xPosition * 0x5ac0db) + (int) (zPosition * zPosition) * 0x4307a7L + (int) (zPosition * 0x5f24f) ^ 0x3ad8025fL); return rnd.\n\nnextInt (10) == 0; } public static void main (String args) {long seed = 12345L; // the seed from /seed as a 64bit long literal int xPosition = 123; int zPosition = 456; System.\n\nout.\n\nprintln (isSlimeChunk (seed, xPosition, zPosition)); } } That is, using the chunk coordinates to help generate a seed, a random number between 0 and 9 inclusive is generated.\n\nIf that number is 0, the chunk can spawn slimes.\n\nTo convert world coordinates to chunk coordinates, divide by 16 and round down.\n\nNote that xPosition, and zPosition are 32-bit integers (int s).\n\nAs per Java Edition 1.20.5 snapshot 24W13A, 2 slimes can spawn whenever any entity affected by Oozing is killed.\n\nThe slime chunk algorithm in Bedrock Edition is different from in Java Edition.\n\nThe algorithm doesn't depend on the world seed, thus the chunks that slimes can naturally spawn in inhabit the same coordinates for every world.\n\n[2] If a slime's size is 1, it drops 0-2 slimeballs unless killed by a frog.\n\nThis can be increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 5 slimeballs.\n\nWhen killed by a frog, it always drops 1 slimeball.\n\nSlimes also drop experience points equal to their size: 4 for large slimes, 2 for medium slimes, or 1 for small slimes.\n\nBecause slimes split into 2-4 smaller slimes when they die, a player can earn a possible maximum of 28 experience points from killing one large slime and all the slimes that split from it.\n\nA slime jumping.\n\nSlimes move by hopping, which they do every 10 to 30 ticks (1 \u2044 2 to 1 1 \u2044 2 seconds), and can swim in water and climb ladders and scaffolding.\n\nUnlike other mobs, slimes continue moving when no players are nearby.\n\nTheir exact routine is as follows: The slime searches for a player (or, failing that, an iron golem) within 16 blocks (spherical) distance.\n\nIf no target is found, the slime waits 10 to 30 ticks (1 \u2044 2 to 1 1 \u2044 2 seconds) between jumps, and changes direction randomly every 40 to 100 ticks (2 to 5 seconds).\n\nIf a target is found, the delay before jumping is 1 \u2044 3 as long (3 to 10 ticks), and the slime's direction is set directly toward the target before jumping.\n\nUnlike most mobs, slimes do not pathfind towards their target, always approaching their target in a straight line, without avoiding environmental hazards such as lava, cactus or dangerous falls.\n\nThis means they can easily get stuck in corners or behind walls, not knowing how to circumvent them.\n\nThis behavior is shared by magma cubes.\n\nA slime's maximum health is equal to its size squared, and its dimensions are 0.51 blocks times its size in each dimension.\n\nWhen a slime attacks, it deals damage equal to its size, except for size 1 (smallest) slimes, which do no damage, and do not prevent sleeping.\n\nBecause small slimes still have a hostile AI, they continuously attack the player.\n\nA slime's jump distance also depends on its size; a slime jumps a distance slightly farther than its length.\n\nWhen landing, a number (8 times the slime's size) of slime particles appear.\n\nSlimes will always, regardless of size, jump 1 block high.\n\nWhen a slime larger than 1 dies, it spawns 2-4 new slimes equivalent to its size divided by 2, rounding down.\n\nA slime that was named with a name tag produces smaller slimes with the same name when it dies.\n\nSlimes continuously damage all players and iron golems  [JE only ] they collide with (although damage immunity reduces the actual damage to 1 attack every half second), unlike other mobs that damage only those targets they specifically attack.\n\n[3] Slimes in water attempt to swim to the surface if possible.\n\nIf forced to stay submerged, they eventually drown, splitting into smaller slimes that drown and finally drop slimeballs.\n\nJava Edition: Slimes use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Slimes have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Size: The size of the slime.\n\nNote that this value is zero-based, so 0 is the smallest slime, 1 is the next larger, etc.\n\nThe sizes that spawn naturally are 0, 1, and 3.\n\nValues that are greater than 126 get clamped to 126.\n\nwasOnGround: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the slime is touching the ground.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nNote: This video is from 2012.\n\nSince then, slime spawning in swamps has been added to the game.\n\nIssues relating to \"Slime\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nIn Java Edition, with commands, the size of slimes can be customized.\n\nSizes go from 1 up to 127; the size-127 slime is the largest of any mob in the game, bigger than the ender dragon.\n\nBecause a slime's movement speed is tied to its size it becomes impossible for the player to outrun a size 8 slime on flat ground without potion effects.\n\nWhen a slime searches for nearby targets or checks to see if it should despawn, it checks from a point at the center of its hitbox on the x and z-axis and the bottom of its y-axis.\n\nTherefore, a custom-size slime sufficiently huge can be right in front of the player and be completely passive, and it may even despawn if the slime is large enough.\n\nThe slime is the most effecient source of exp without farms, easy to kill, high spawn rates in swamps and slime chunks, and deal super low damage to you with armor.\n\nGreen-colored Slimes are also present in Minicraft, a 2D Minecraft -inspired game also created by Notch.\n\nIf a player walks inside a slime, they can see the slime itself inside of a slime block.\n\nif the player looks at the corner of a glass block, the slime inside the slime block disappears, looking like the slime block is alive.\n\nSmall: 0.6 block cube.\n\nMedium: 1.2 block cube.\n\nBig: 2.4 block cube.\n\nSlimes of various sizes underground.\n\nA big slime covering a minecart.\n\nA group of slimes within a Superflat world.\n\nA group of slimes within a village.\n\nA group of slimes within a swamp.\n\nThe largest possible slime size: size 127.\n\nA size 10 slime compared to an oak tree.\n\nA group of slimes within a cave.\n\nA group of three slimes are led out of a cave onto the surface.\n\nA slime within pocket edition alpha.\n\nA group of slimes within the promotional artwork for the first Caves & Cliffs update.\n\nA slime within Minecraft Dungeons.\n\nPrison Slimes, a slime variant that can be found within Minecraft Story Mode Season 2.\n\nA Slime Spirit within Super Smash Bros.\n\nUltimate.\n\nA LEGO slime.\n\n\"Frogs,\" an official T-Shirt design featuring two slimes.\n\nMagma Cube \u2013 A similar mob that spawns only in the Nether and drops magma cream Tropical Slime - A variant that is found in Minecraft Earth \u2191 MC-252424 \u2014 \"Slimes spawn at light levels greater then 0 in Swamps\" \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 The Bedrock Edition slime chunk algorithm was reverse engineered by @protolambda and @jocopa3 and can be found on GitHub: [1] \u2191 MC-131426 \u2191 http://getsatisfaction.com/mojang/topics/will_slimes_ever_return_to_minecraft \u2191 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyNvBkn4E3U \u2191 MC-97958 \u2191 MC-48923 \u2014 \"Slime/magma cubes not affected by jump boost potion effect\" \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 MC-118616 \u2014 \"The sounds of magma cubes and slimes aren't controlled by the \"Hostile Creatures\" sound slider\" \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\nEntities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

[BE only ] In Bedrock Edition, vindicators are passive to players on Peaceful difficulty but will still attack other mobs.\n\nWhile idle, a vindicator crosses its arms similar to a villager, with its axe stowed.\n\nWhile giving chase, the vindicator brandishes its axe and sprints.\n\nIf it has no weapons, a mainhand-unarmed vindicator raises both of its hands when attacking.\n\nOn Normal and Hard difficulties, vindicators that are part of a raid can break wooden doors.\n\nThis is controlled by the raider tag.\n\n[1] Like any illager during a raid, vindicators celebrate by cheering if all the villagers are killed or all the beds are destroyed.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, if a pillager arrow accidentally strikes a vindicator, the vindicator retaliates against the pillager, but the pillager does not retaliate.\n\nAll illagers remain friendly to each other in Java Edition, even when struck accidentally.\n\n[2] Vindicators are likely to call help from other vindicators when attacked by mobs or players (except for illagers and goats, or if they were killed in one hit), inciting them all to attack the aggressor.\n\nThey do not call help from other kinds of illagers.\n\nVindicator raiders can break doors and open doors like villagers.\n\n[needs testing ] Ringing a bell gives all vindicators within 32 blocks the Glowing effect for 3 seconds.\n\nVindicators can only sprint, even when idle.\n\nA dispenser can equip a vindicator with armor, but it is invisible and does not show on its model.\n\nArmed vindicators hit for 7.5 \u00d7 3.75 to 19.5 \u00d7 9.75 damage, depending on difficulty.\n\nThey tie with piglin brutes for dealing the third most melee damage in the game, following the iron golem at 21 \u00d7 10.5 damage and the warden at 45 \u00d7 22.5 damage.\n\nThe vindicator's axe attack disables the player's shield for 5 seconds, even when riding a ravager.\n\nA vindicator named Johnny (using a name tag, named spawn egg, etc., or has its Johnny tag set to 1b) is hostile to every mob except evokers, pillagers, other vindicators, ghasts [3] and players in Creative or Spectator mode.\n\nIn Java Edition, they also do not attack baby villagers, illusioners or armor stands [4].\n\nThis hostility extends to vexes, ravagers and witches in both editions.\n\n[5] \"Johnny\" vindicators will also attempt to attack the ender dragon, but it will not take damage.\n\nAll hostile or neutral mobs try to attack the \"Johnny\" vindicator in return, except for ender dragons, [verify ] endermites (as they die in one hit), guardians, elder guardians, phantoms, goats (apart from their usual ramming behavior), slimes, magma cubes, and ravagers.\n\nSince raid captains can instruct nearby pillagers to attack their target, naming a vindicator raid captain \"Johnny\" will cause other raiders to attack Johnny's target, even if they wouldn't usually.\n\nThis can cause witches, vexes and ravagers to target one another, and can even cause ravagers to attack themselves.\n\nIf this causes a witch to target a ravager, the witch will instead throw Splash Potions of healing, since ravagers are raid mobs.\n\nThe Johnny tag overrides its name; the player can give the vindicator any other name and set the Johnny tag to 1b and it remains hostile in the same way as described.\n\nConversely, the player can name the vindicator \" Johnny \" and set the Johnny tag to 0b, causing the vindicator to act as a normal vindicator.\n\nNaming a \"Johnny\" vindicator something else using a name tag will not set its Johnny tag to 0b, and it will continue to exhibit \"Johnny\" behavior. [Java Edition only ] Naming a vindicator spawn egg \"Johnny\" and using it on a spawner has no effect; normal vindicators spawn rather than vindicators named \"Johnny\".

    "content": "This article is about a hostile monster mob in Minecraft.\n\nFor the unseen illager in Minecraft Dungeons, see MCD:Warden.\n\nFor the ancient mob in Minecraft Dungeons, see MCD:Frostwarden.\n\nFor the character in Minecraft: Story Mode, see Minecraft Story Mode:The Warden.\n\nThis page uses many images.\n\nIt is not recommended for people with limited or slow internet connections to read through this page.\n\nWarden Health 500 \u00d7 250 Behavior Hostile Spawn When a player activates naturally generated sculk shriekers three times or more Damage Melee: Easy: 16 \u00d7 8 Normal: 30 \u00d7 15 Hard: 45 \u00d7 22.5 Ranged: Easy: 6 Normal: 10 Hard: 15 \u00d7 7.5 Details Size Height: 2.9 blocks Width: 0.9 blocks Warden is an extremely powerful hostile mob summoned by sculk shriekers in the deep dark biome.\n\nIt attacks by swinging its arms downward, dealing the strongest melee damage of all mobs, and can also release a sonic boom attack that immediately strikes the target, piercing through obstacles and deals damage that cannot be reduced except by the Resistance effect.\n\nWardens are completely blind and rely on vibrations, smell, and touch to detect players and mobs, and can therefore be evaded via sneaking, diversions (snowballs, arrows, etc.) and wool.\n\nA warden emerges from the ground after being summoned by sculk shriekers Wardens do not use standard mob spawning mechanics.\n\nThey are instead spawned when a player activates naturally generated sculk shriekers three times and if there isn't already another warden within 24 blocks of it.\n\nA warden spawns by emerging from the ground near the shrieker that summoned it, taking about 6.7 seconds to do so and being completely invulnerable until fully emerged.\n\nThe warning count for sculk shriekers is specific to each player rather than each sculk shrieker.\n\nThis means that the player can activate three different shriekers in different locations and a warden emerges after the third activation.\n\nThe light level does not have an effect on warden spawning.\n\nUp to 20 attempts are made to spawn a warden within an 11\u00d713\u00d711 cubic area, which is centered on the shrieker.\n\nDuring each attempt, the game picks a random column from the y axis, then the game picks the topmost block in that column with a top surface with full collision and the block above must have no collision (the spawning warden cannot collide with any existing entities or liquids; wardens must not have water inside their spawn block, where their feet go, but they can spawn with water in the second and third block.\n\nFor example, a pressure plate with water flowing on top is still a valid location).\n\nIn Java Edition, warden spawning can be toggled on or off with the game rule doWardenSpawning.\n\nA warden drops a single sculk catalyst upon death, unaffected by Looting.\n\nIt also drops 5 experience if killed by either a player or a tamed wolf.\n\nA warden is blind and seeks out targets by sensing vibrations and by sniffing.\n\nAfter spawning, wardens wander randomly around the world and move toward nearby vibrations originating from players, mobs and non-mob sources including projectiles and minecarts.\n\nA warden also periodically sniffs the area around it, allowing it to zero in on targets even if they don't create vibrations.\n\nIf a warden is actively sniffing and it picks up a nearby vibration, movement, or action then it will become increasingly agitated.\n\nThis effect applies to players, blocks, and other entities.\n\nA warden can fit inside any space that is 1 block wide and 3 blocks tall, allowing it to chase players and mobs through small corridors.\n\nWardens are immune to damage from fire or lava and do not take knockback.\n\nThey pursue through blocks that are usually avoided by other mobs, including rails [1], cacti, or magma blocks.\n\nA warden, whether angered or not, gives 12 seconds of Darkness to all players within a 20 block radius of it every 6 seconds.\n\nThe souls in its chest make a low heartbeat that occurs in tandem with the Darkness effect.\n\nThe heartbeat speeds up as the warden becomes increasingly agitated.\n\n[2] A warden prefers to track down the most suspicious targets, rather than the ones closest to it.\n\n[3] A warden listens to all vibrations within a 16 block radius, except those from other wardens, armor stands, dying mobs and players in Creative or Spectator mode.\n\nLike with sculk sensors, they cannot detect vibrations from a sneaking player that is moving, jumping, falling or shooting a projectile.\n\nA warden has a 2-second cooldown between detecting vibrations.\n\nA warden is aware of all targetable entities within a 49\u00d751\u00d749 box around itself.\n\nIf the warden has a targetable entity, is not investigating any disturbances, and is otherwise idle, it pathfinds toward the closest entity, prioritizing players over mobs.\n\nWhile pathfinding, the warden can begin a 'sniff' behavior and animation.\n\nThis takes around 4.2 seconds and has a 5-10 seconds cooldown.\n\nA warden can still sniff out sneaking players, despite that they cannot detect vibrations from them.\n\nWardens keep track of how angry they are at each suspect as a number from 0 to 150.\n\nWhen a warden notices a vibration, it adds anger to the player or mob that caused the vibration.\n\nIt adds 10 anger if the vibration was from a projectile or 35 anger for other vibrations.\n\nHowever, if two projectiles from the same player/mob are heard by the warden within five seconds, it instead adds the full 35 anger toward that player/mob.\n\nWardens do not add anger toward a mob/player if the projectile was shot from more than 30 blocks away, although the projectile does count toward the counter of two projectiles.\n\nAnger decays at a rate of 1 per second and immediately clears if the targeted player switches to Creative or Spectator modes, the target or warden leaves the dimension, or if the target dies.\n\nA warden adds 35 anger toward any mob that directly touches it.\n\nThis effect has a 1-second cooldown.\n\nWhen it finishes sniffing, a warden adds 35 anger to the nearest mob or player within 6 blocks horizontally and 20 blocks vertically, a cylindrical volume centered on the warden.\n\nOnce a warden reaches 80 anger with a target, it roars for 4.2 seconds, adds another 20 anger, and pursues the target.\n\nIn this angered state, the warden chases the target normally despite being blind.\n\nA warden also enters its hostile state and adds 100 anger if directly attacked by a mob.\n\nIf the attacking player or mob is within 5 blocks, it skips its roaring animation altogether and immediately gives chase.\n\nA warden is biased toward player vibrations, attacks, and contact - even if a warden is angrier at another mob, it still attacks the player first as long as they have angered the warden as well.\n\nThis is not true of any other mob.\n\n[4] After 60 seconds of being \"calm\" and not detecting any vibrations or sniffing any mobs, a warden burrows back into the ground and despawns, unless it has been named.\n\nIf the warden is floating on a liquid, it instead immediately despawns without any burrowing animation.\n\nDuring its emerging/burrowing animation, a warden cannot detect any vibrations, and can take damage only from / kill, though it can still be pushed by entities, pistons, or liquids.\n\nNamed wardens do not dig or despawn.\n\nThe only exception to this rule are wardens spawned as part of a team [Java Edition only ] through the / summon command immediately digs and despawn upon spawning, ignoring everything else in the process regardless of whether it spawned with a name, with PersistenceRequired:1 or not.\n\nA warden's melee attack has a cooldown of 0.9 seconds and disables shields for 5 seconds, dealing 16 \u00d7 8 to 45 \u00d7 22.5 health points depending on the difficulty.\n\nThe Warden's sonic boom attack If a warden cannot reach its target, it switches to its ranged attack: a sonic boom.\n\nIt does so when the following are true: It has been 10 seconds since the warden detected the target It has been 5 seconds since the warden last used a melee or ranged attack The target is within 15 blocks horizontally and 20 blocks vertically of the warden.\n\nThe sonic boom aims directly at the target, making it impossible to dodge, passing through blocks and other mobs without damaging them.\n\nA warden takes 1.7 seconds to charge and unleashes the attack, which instantly hits the target as long as the target is within attack range.\n\nThe attack takes an additional 1.3 seconds to cool down before the warden can use melee attacks again for a total of 3 seconds.\n\nThe sonic boom is visible via green-blue particles that are projected out of the warden's chest in a 20 blocks radius.\n\nThis attack bypasses shields, armor, enchantments, blocks and even the wither armor of the wither.\n\nOnly the Resistance status effect can reduce this attack's damage.\n\nJava Edition: Wardens use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition:

format/Entity format.\n\nKilling a warden doesn't count for the Monster Hunter advancement nor is it needed to receive the Monsters Hunted advancement.\n\n[5] [6] Issues relating to \"Warden\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nAlthough the warden is supposed to be blind, spectating it reveals that it still has normal vision.\n\n[10] The concept for the warden was originally planned for the Nether Update as a \"blind piglin that could only respond to sounds\" that could be found within a \"new biome\".\n\n[11] Brandon Pearce considers the warden as something entirely new as it isn't a boss or a mini boss (in spite of having the combined health of the wither and ender dragon) or a regular enemy but a force of nature: \"when a tornado is barreling towards you, you don't try to kill it - you run away!\n\nThe warden is exactly the same.\" [12] Brandon's thought process on finally giving the warden a drop after he was heavily against it was the warden should never drop something that is important or hard to get that would be worth going through the trouble of fighting it.\n\nIn this case, fighting a warden is not worth a sculk catalyst.\n\nThis change was made for renewability farms and tech players.\n\n[13] When Chi Wong was working the warden's digging animation he wanted to make sure the timing was right and make sure while it was going down, it's not going down like an elevator, but it actually digs, and the feeling Chi wanted to convey with it is it has tons of rage, it is annoyed, and it wants to go down.\n\n[14] The warden is the most concepted and worked through mob in Minecraft in terms of sound design.\n\n[15] When Brandon was first developing the warden, sound design was important to him, and the warden was designed with that in mind.\n\n[16] While designing the warden, Brandon wanted to hear the player's \"heartbeat\" as the warden got closer for anticipation but he thought that it felt out of place and didn't make sense to hear the player's heartbeat.\n\nHis solution was for something else to make the heartbeat, and thus the warden gained a heartbeat.\n\nIt was also a design choice to mimic some really interesting sound design without breaking immersion.\n\nIt also adds more to the warden itself and lore reasons as to why a warden has a heartbeat.\n\n[17] [18] Some previous names being considered for the warden were the shade, [19] the stalker and the hollowed.\n\n[20] The shade was a vaguely humanoid translucent mob with glowing eyes.\n\nIt was meant to be a more ambient mob, which would stand in darkness with only its eyes visible and would slowly fade away as the player approached it.\n\nIt would also imitate the noise of other mobs, making it sound as though they were right behind the player.\n\nRather than an iteration on the warden, by then called the \"stalker\", the shade had come to be a completely separate mob to the stalker, though in some concepts it was meant to be sort of complementary, living in the ancient cities and helping the stalker by tricking players into alerting it.\n\nIt was eventually scrapped due to a feeling that it would grow to become annoying rather than creepy, and so the team could better focus on developing the stalker.\n\n[21] The stalker iteration was tall and asymmetrical with a glowing core, sometimes referred to as a chest crystal.\n\n[22] It occurred in totems throughout the deep dark.\n\nThe stalker would stand completely still to trick players into taking its core and aggravating it, and could transform into a form one block high form to prevent players from escaping through small tunnels.\n\nThis iteration, specifically its appearance and transformation mechanic, felt clunky and was deemed more goofy than scary, so it was scrapped by the Mojang Studios gameplay developers.\n\nThe vibration-sensing aspect, which was developed in this version, however, was passed down to and refined in the later iterations.\n\n[23] [24] The hollowed was designed with the intent of inciting trypophobia and had white flesh with holes in it, and a rib cage-like mouth.\n\nAccording to Brandon Pearce, its design was an experiment to see how far the boundaries of Minecraft could be pushed and to try and draw a line as to what would be acceptable.\n\nThe design had to ultimately be toned down multiple times due to said metaphorical line being crossed and after many back-and-forths between the developers, the directors and art team, a design similar to the current one was landed on.\n\n[25] [26] The warden also had a number of other mechanics and abilities planned: If the player managed to get out of the warden's attack and pathfinding range but still be within its detection range, the warden would use a \"mind-altering\" attack that would cause the player to move erratically (walking forward would cause the player to go backwards, etc.) and deal damage overtime.\n\nThe mechanic was eventually scrapped due to being deemed too complicated.\n\n[27] [28] The warden would destroy blocks or burrow through them.\n\nThe former was rejected due to the developers wanting to limit the number of \"destructive\" mobs there are in the game and the latter was rejected due to being too difficult to implement.\n\n[28] The warden could hide the player's hunger bar and health bar.\n\n[29] Brandon Pearce wanted the warden to be immune to damage to discourage players from fighting it, but he didn't think that would work for a sandbox game.\n\n[30] The warden would originally burn when exposed to daylight.\n\n[31] In the Bedrock Beta/Preview 1.18.30.32 the warden would dig back down when exposed in daylight but it was changed so the warden doesn't dig back down but stays when exposed to daylight in Beta/Preview 1.19.0.20.\n\nThe warden and sculk were inspired by Lovecraftian horror as the developers wanted to make something that wasn't in the traditional scary like jumpscares and etc.\n\nbut in a mysterious and unknown scary.\n\n[32] In the fifth episode of Minecraft Now, it was revealed by Jasper Boerstra that the warden went through over 175 different concept iterations and they have explored everything because they wanted the warden to be something really special and also for it to be scary, beautiful, ugly, cute, and have some empathy.\n\n[33] In the sixth episode of The Secrets of Minecraft, it was jokingly revealed that the warden's personal names are \"Jonathan\" and \"William\", depending on the scene, similar to how the player, the ender dragon or the wither all have personal joke names.\n\n[20] \"Warden\" itself was also jokingly broken down into \"War!\n\nDens!\" in the description.\n\n\"Jonathan\" can be seen on a blackboard for name suggestions alongside \"the stalker\" and \"the hollowed\".\n\nIt jokingly explained that the name \"warden\" was the result of calling it \"William\" and spelling it wrong.\n\nIn the tenth episode, both names were used when Narrator spotted the warden behind him.\n\n[34] He mistakenly called the warden Jonathan before correcting himself as William, foreshadowing Jonathan Minecraft, who appears in the eleventh and final episode leading into Around the Minecraft World in 80 Biomes.\n\n[35] Brandon Pearce stated in a tweet that the souls in the warden's chest is important to its lore.\n\n[36] He also stated that the warden is inspired by the mystery heard at the end of the music disc \"11\".\n\n[37] Coincidentally, in the spin-off game, Minecraft: Story Mode, there is an unrelated character also named the warden.\n\nEven if the player wears a full set of Netherite armor and all four gears contain Protection IV resulting in a 64% damage reduction cap, the player will still more likely to die first as the Warden only needs to hit the aforementioned player exactly four times, assuming no potion effect is in play.\n\nAn interesting fact is that if you invert the colors of the axolotl, the color palette is like that of the warden.\n\nIt is unknown if this is intentional or a coincidence.\n\nIn the 15 Year Map, The Warden appears in the Caves and Cliffs which can be found in the Deep Dark.\n\nBut they were added in The Wild update not in the Caves and Cliffs.\n\nThe Secrets of Minecraft: How We're Making the Warden, Minecraft, January 21, 2022.\n\nA warden.\n\nA warden with all

article: Tutorials/Witch farming The witch may spawn in the Overworld above opaque blocks at a light level of 0, in all biomes except mushroom fields and deep dark.\n\nEvery swamp hut spawns a witch and a cat inside during world generation both which never despawn.\n\nOtherwise, witches spawn in the hut.\n\nIn Java Edition, only witches spawn in the 7\u00d77\u00d79 volume that is the hut, which is the size of the roof and one block over the porch, from one level below the floor of the hut to two blocks above the roof.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the hut has a hardcoded spawn spot on which witches spawn: the spawn spot is the same for every hut.\n\nSome witches always spawn as part of raids starting from wave 4 in Bedrock Edition or wave 3 or 4 in Java Edition depending on the world difficulty.\n\nA villager transforms into a witch when lightning strikes within four blocks.\n\nThe witch transformed from a villager does not despawn and cannot be changed back into a villager.\n\nThis witch attacks the player with its potions even if the player traded with it before.\n\nThe rooftop and scale of a swamp hut, as well as the spawning zone.\n\nThe spawn area matches the roof, plus the porch.\n\n(Java Edition) Shows the side of a swamp hut, also shows the scale of it and proper height.\n\n(Java Edition) Witches spawn on the northwest corner of the spawn spot, which is marked with a block of lapis lazuli in this picture.\n\n(Bedrock Edition) Witches are a source of potion ingredients and are the only mobs that are able to spawn in the small area around a swamp hut.\n\nThese huts are the best place to farm witches, but they require spawning platforms and light levels of 0.\n\nA hut can support a maximum of three spawning platforms.\n\nWitch huts generate in swamp biomes sometimes, but the witch-exclusiveness depends on the entire hut being inside a swamp biome.\n\nIn raids found in villages, it is more worthwhile to simply build an illager farm and deal with witches as they spawn.\n\nA witch drops 5 experience orbs when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nWitches have the largest loot table of any mob, making one to three drops of zero to two items each, for a maximum of six items total.\n\nA witch may drop Stick, Glass Bottle, Glowstone Dust, Redstone Dust, Spider Eye, Gunpowder or Sugar.\n\n[1] The likelihood of a witch to drop sticks is 25%, while the remaining items have a probability of 12.5%.\n\nThe odds of a witch dropping the maximum amount of items possible without a Looting enchantment are 1 in 81 (1.2%).\n\nEach level of Looting increases the maximum items dropped by one for each of the one to three drops, leading to a maximum of five items per drop and a maximum of fifteen items total.\n\nNo Looting averages two items per kill, Looting I averages three, Looting II averages four and Looting III averages five.\n\nA potion has a 8.5% chance of dropping if a witch is killed while drinking the potion increased by 1% for every level of Looting.\n\nA witch drops one of the following in this case: Potion of Healing Potion of Fire Resistance Potion of Swiftness Potion of Water Breathing A witch is neither an illager nor a villager.\n\nWitches do not use housing, the equipment in their swamp huts and cannot open doors.\n\nWitches are peaceful toward villagers and wandering traders when not participating in raids, although their potions can hit one by accident.\n\nIn Java Edition, witches are given the Glowing effect for 3 seconds when a bell is rung within 32 blocks of them.\n\nThis applies to all witches, regardless of whether they participate in raids or not.\n\nThe poison, instant damage, evoker fangs, warden's sonic boom, and the Thorns enchantment magical sources are 85% less effective against witches.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, witches are immune to poison, fatal poison and to their own thrown harming potions.\n\nThe particle effect that witches emit.\n\nWitches have a 1.5% chance every second to spawn 10 to 44 ornamental particles above their heads, named \u201cwitch\u201d in Java Edition or \u201cwitchspell\u201d in Bedrock Edition and purple in color.\n\nA witch pursues the player within 16 blocks and uses potions of the first level in combat, throwing splash potions offensively and drinking potions defensively.\n\nThese potions are the same as ones obtainable through brewing, with the same duration.\n\nA witch has an infinite stock of potions, even when transformed from a villager or not having had any potions equipped in their inventory.\n\nEach potion chosen by the witch depends on the circumstance and is thrown within ten blocks and in a three-second interval.\n\nThe witch throws a splash potion of Slowness if the player is eight, nine or ten blocks away and does not already have the Slowness effect.\n\nThis makes it harder for the player to escape if they attempt to.\n\nThe witch throws a splash potion of Poison if the player's health is at least 8 and is not already poisoned.\n\nThe witch has a 25% chance of throwing a splash potion of Weakness if the player is 3 or less blocks away and does not already have the Weakness effect.\n\nThis is used to weaken the player's melee attacks on the witch if they attempt to.\n\nThis Weakness effect can be used to cure zombie villagers.\n\nIf none of the above conditions are true, the witch defaults to using a splash potion of Harming, which does 6 magical damage.\n\nA witch may choose to equip and drink a potion each game tick (1 \u2044 20 second) if it is not already drinking a potion.\n\nDrinking the potion takes 1.6 seconds [2] and slows down its moving speed.\n\nIt does not attack during this time.\n\nWhen 80% under water and lacking Water Breathing, there is a 15% chance of drinking a potion of Water Breathing.\n\nWhen on fire or the last damage taken in the past 2 seconds was fire damage, there is a 15% chance of drinking a potion of Fire Resistance.\n\nWhen not at full health, there is a 5% chance of drinking a potion of Healing, which heals 4.\n\n[3] When the witch is eleven or more blocks from a target and does not have the Speed effect, there is a 50% chance of drinking a potion of Swiftness.\n\nAs a result, witches are difficult to kill via suffocation or cacti due to their frequent use of healing potions, cannot drown underwater and require a long time to die in lava or fire.\n\nIf the raid members kill all the villagers in a village, witches jump in commemoration to their victory.\n\nIn Java Edition, any witch can join a patrol if sufficiently near a patrol captain.\n\nThese witches are hostile towards villagers, wandering traders and iron golems if in their sight.\n\nWitches that participate in a raid seek out illagers and ravagers and throw splash potions of Regeneration of 45 seconds or Instant Health if they have 4 or less.\n\nWitches do not retaliate when attacked by evoker fangs, illagers, or harming potions from other witches.\n\nInstead, they drink a beneficial potion.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, witches participating in a raid do not heal other illagers [until BE 1.20.30 ], but still attack the player, iron golems and snow golems.\n\nWitches throw negative splash potions at any mob that attacks it, including other witches and illagers.\n\nJava Edition: Witches use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 Except for the second copy of ambient5, which is 0.72-1.08 Bedrock Edition: \u2191 a b 0.8-1.2 for all except the copy of ambient5, the first sound in the

maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe witch is based on Baba Yaga, a witch from Slavic folklore who also lives in a swamp hut.\n\n[13] When the subject of witches dropping sticks was brought up, Nathan Adams jokingly replied that it's because witches are made of wood.\n\n[14] He later explained [15] that it was a reference to this scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\n\nA witch fits through two block tall gaps, despite being taller than two blocks with its hat.\n\nWhen drinking a potion, a witch's nose lifts and points forward.\n\nA witch's nose slightly wiggles when idle.\n\nWitches have small mouths hidden under their noses.\n\nDuring their potion-drinking animation, this mouth becomes visible from the side.\n\nIn the Village and Pillage update

[Java Edition only ] When spawned, the wither grows larger in size as its health bar fills up.\n\nWhile in this state, the wither is invulnerable, and neither moves nor attacks.\n\nWhen this state ends (after 11 seconds), the wither creates a large explosion centered on itself, destroying nearby blocks and dealing up to 68 \u00d7 34 damage to nearby mobs and players, depending on difficulty.\n\nThis explosion has a blast power of 7, more than that of a charged creeper or an end crystal.\n\nIt is accompanied by a loud gruesome sound that can be heard equally from across the map and in all dimensions [JE only ].\n\n[1] After this, the wither attacks nearby mobs and can take damage.\n\nThe wither has the greatest natural health of all mobs in Minecraft (exceeded by the warden, while Bedrock Edition 's wither still has the highest health), at 300 \u00d7 150 in Java Edition or 600 \u00d7 300 in Bedrock Edition.\n\nThe wither is immune to fire, lava, drowning damage, and freezing.\n\nLike other undead mobs, the wither is harmed by the Instant Health effect and healed by the Instant Damage effect as well as affected by weapons with the Smite enchantment.\n\nIt is immune to all other status effects, like the ender dragon.\n\nUpon taking damage, the wither breaks all blocks within a 3\u00d74\u00d73 area around it, including blast-resistant blocks like obsidian, crying obsidian, and ancient debris, dropping them as items if possible.\n\nThe wither is the only mob in the game that can destroy obsidian.\n\nThe wither cannot break the following blocks: Barrier Bedrock End Portal End Portal Frame End Gateway Command Block Structure Block Jigsaw Block Light Block Moving Piston Moving Block  [Bedrock Edition only ] Reinforced Deepslate In Java Edition, these blocks are listed under the wither_immune tag.\n\nThe wither attacking a villager.\n\nThe wither's block-breaking behavior makes suffocation ineffective under most circumstances.\n\nHowever, the blocks listed above, as well as some natural structures that include them, can be used to suffocate the wither due to their wither immunity.\n\nThe wither is hostile toward all mobs except: Undead mobs Zombies and their variants Skeletons and their variants Zombified piglin s Skeleton horse s and zombie horse s Phantom Zoglin Other withers Ghast s [2] Mobs with the Invulnerable NBT tag.\n\nIf the wither is idle, it simply hovers and is unable to gain altitude.\n\nOn Normal or Hard difficulty, it fires blue skulls in random directions until it finds a target.\n\nThe wither's boss health bar color depends on the edition: Dark purple on Java Edition, or pink on Bedrock Edition.\n\nIt appears only when a player is looking in the wither's direction, including through walls.\n\nAll withers display a boss bar on the screen.\n\nRenamed withers display the changed name above its boss bar.\n\nThe sky darkens when the wither spawns (a kind of fog).\n\nWither with 'wither armor' effect, after half health depleted.\n\nUpon noticing a mob, the wither hovers above it and rapidly shoots black wither skulls.\n\nEach head fires independently, allowing a wither to attack up to three different mobs/ players at the same time.\n\nThe main head controls the wither's movement and has a 0.1% chance to shoot a blue wither skull instead of the default black one.\n\nWhenever a wither kills another mob, a wither rose is planted if the ground is grass block, dirt, coarse dirt, moss block, mud, netherrack, soul sand, or soul soil on Java Edition, or otherwise dropped as an item at that mob's location; however, it may be destroyed by other wither skulls.\n\nWither roses are planted/dropped even when the game rule doMobLoot is set to false.\n\n[3] The wither has a passive regeneration rate of 1 every 20 ticks (1 second), and a direct killing blow on a target instantly heals 5.\n\nWhen its health drops below half (150 \u00d7 75), the wither gains a natural \"wither armor\" effect, which makes it immune to damage from arrows and thrown tridents and causes it to fly at the same height as the target.\n\nThe armor disappears if it regenerates above half health.\n\nUpon noticing a player or mob, the wither flies to a random location and hovers in place.\n\nIt shoots 3 black wither skulls and one blue wither skull before flying to another location.\n\nThe time between each shot decreases as the wither loses health.\n\nOn Normal difficulty or higher, if the wither has targeted an entity but cannot find a location to pathfind to, it shoots random blue skulls in a random direction along with the skulls directed toward the target.\n\nWhen a wither reaches halfway of its total health, it causes a large explosion that spawns 3 wither skeletons (except on Easy difficulty), as well as gaining wither armor.\n\nInstead of flying to a random location, it dashes toward its target, destroying blocks and damaging mobs in its path.\n\nIt also fires up to 4 skulls per burst: three black skulls followed by one blue skull.\n\nIt has different spawn and death animations, both of which involve the wither exploding.\n\nWither roses always drop as an item when the wither kills a mob.\n\nWither roses are dropped even when the game rule doMobLoot is set to false.\n\n[4] The wither rose inflicts the Wither effect for a couple of seconds when stepped on.\n\nThe sky light level drops to 11 and dark clouds appear from the moment the wither spawns until it is dead, preventing zombies, skeletons, and drowned from burning in sunlight.\n\nOn Easy difficulty, the wither does not inflict the wither effect or summon wither skeletons.\n\nWithers will retain their anti-projectile armor after healing it over 1/2 of its total HP (301 \u00d7 150.5), though it disappears after the game is restarted.\n\n[5] Not to be confused with Wither Skeleton Skull.\n\nWither Skull Normal Dangerous Behavior Does not exist Details Size Height: 0.3125 Blocks Width: 0.3125 Blocks When attacking, the wither rapidly fires explosive projectiles called wither skulls, which look like its own heads, at its target.\n\nThere are two types of wither skulls: a fast-moving black one, and a slower blue one.\n\nBlack wither skulls explode with a blast power of 1, the same as a ghast 's fireball, and cannot break blocks with a blast resistance above 4.\n\nBlue wither skulls have the same explosion strength, but move slower and are more destructive to terrain.\n\nBlue wither skulls break all breakable blocks (including obsidian, ancient debris, and blocks of netherite), but cannot break unbreakable blocks like bedrock, end portal frames, and reinforced deepslate.\n\nIn Minecraft Education, blue wither skulls deal increased damage, but with the same explosion radius.\n\nIf either type of wither skull hits a player or mob, it does 8 damage on Normal difficulty.\n\nIt also inflicts Wither II for 10 seconds on Normal difficulty and 40 seconds on Hard, which turns the player's hearts black () and drains health, similarly to Poison.\n\nHowever, unlike Poison, it can kill the player.\n\nLike other status effects, the Wither effect can be cured by drinking milk.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition and Legacy Console Edition, the blue skull can be deflected by hitting it with an empty hand, weapon, tool, or throwable projectiles such as tridents, arrows, snowballs, and throwable potions.\n\nJava Edition: Withers use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nWither skulls use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 MC-212623 \u2191 Does not trigger at all if the gamerule globalSoundEvents is false \u2191 MC-177741 Bedrock Edition: \u2191 Is normally 1.0, but can be 0.75

Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Wither\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe painting depicting how to spawn a wither According to Jeb, the wither was inspired by Terraria, which has a summonable boss mechanic.\n\nThe name itself is inspired by a poison spell in another game made by Jeb called Whispers in Akarra.\n\n[10] There is a painting showing the soul sand and wither skeleton skull formation needed to spawn a wither.\n\nIf the wither is damaged by the Void, it frantically attempts to fire blue skulls.\n\nAbove half health, the wither always attempts to stay a few blocks above the mob it is targeting.\n\nThis means that attempting to build or climb up to hit the wither using a sword is essentially impossible.\n\nIf the wither is after a blaze and the blaze tries to fly up to it, the wither attempts to keep rising above the blaze, thus making both of them rise higher until they hit a ceiling or until the blaze despawns or dies.\n\nAlthough the wither is 3.5 blocks tall, 3 blocks wide, and 1 block thick, its hitbox is only 3.5 blocks tall, 1 block wide, and 1 block thick.\n\nThe true dimensions of the wither are: 2.844 blocks tall (varies), 3 blocks wide, and 1.719 blocks long (also varies).\n\nThe wither appears on the four sides of chiseled red sandstone.\n\nThe wither's smaller heads shoot targets slightly slower than the main head.\n\nThe interval for smaller heads is 2\u20133 seconds, while the main head's always 2.\n\nAn enemy called the wither storm appears in Minecraft: Story Mode.\n\nIt was created by replacing the center block of soul sand with a command block.\n\nDespite not having visible feet, withers are still capable of making footstep sounds.\n\n[11] In Java Edition 3D Shareware v1.34, withers drop red keys.\n\nAccording to Quinn Richter, Marketplace Partner Manager, the wither's name is \"Simmons?\", similar to the ender dragon's name being \"Jean?\".\n\n[12] A wither skull can be deflected by shooting an arrow at it. [Bedrock Edition only ] If a deflected wither skull hits the wither, the wither takes damage. [Bedrock Edition only ] A wither and an ender dragon can engage in combat, but neither one damages the other.\n\nDespite being immune to projectiles when it has \"wither armor\", it is still able to be hit by the warden 's sonic boom attack.\n\nThis is because the warden's sonic boom attack is not a projectile, but an instant damage attack.\n\nTherefore, the wither is unable to defend against it with the \"armor\".\n\nThe withering effect after being damaged by a wither skull.\n\nThe \"wither armor\" that blocks arrows.\n\nThe wither and its armor.\n\nA larger image to show how to summon the wither.\n\nThe wither prepares for explosion with the invulnerable status after summoned.\n\nThe pit created after the wither has charged.\n\nThe wither attacking horses.\n\nThe wither's texture.\n\nWither attacking a sheep.\n\nWither attacking a village.\n\nA wither summoning setup.\n\nImage from Dinnerbone of a wither being built horizontally.\n\nA player avoiding a wither by using the Invisibility effect.\n\nFirst image of a wither being built in Bedrock Edition.\n\nWither in promotional artwork for the Pretty Scary Update.\n\nWither Storm, a variant of Wither as it appears on Minecraft: Story Mode.\n\nWither pictured in the Mobestiary.\n\nLEGO Minecraft wither.\n\n\"Acid Wither,\" an official T-Shirt design.\n\n\"Jolly Mobs Flying Head,\" another T-Shirt design.\n\nEnder dragon, the other boss mob in Minecraft Tutorials/Defeating the wither, a tutorial explaining different tactics to fight and kill the wither \u2191 MC-177741 \u2014 Wither sounds play for all players \u2191 MC-162557 \u2014 \"Withers no longer attack ghasts\" \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 MC-154922 \u2191 MCPE-73842 \u2191 MCPE-161643 \u2013 After healing a wither boss over 1/2 HP, it still retains its anti-projectile shield \u2191 \"Minecraft 1.4 - How to Spawn Wither Mob - Mojang PAX 2012 Live @ 3:07\" \u2013 Accelerated Ideas on YouTube \u2191 http://www.twitch.tv/pax2/b/330745811 (at 3:57:47) \u2191 MC-29274 \u2191 MC-189872 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 https://minecraft.net/article/meet-wither \u2191 MC-92623 \u2191 \"Ask Mojang #4: To The Moon!\n\n@ 3:40\" \u2013 Minecraft on YouTube, November 8, 2019 Meet the Wither \u2013 Minecraft.net on February 13, 2017 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

[JE only ] The detection range of zombies is reduced to half of their normal range (17.5 blocks) when the player is wearing a zombie head.\n\nIf a zombie sees a player and a villager together, the zombie prefers to attack the player first.\n\nA zombie already hunting a villager continues to do so even if the player is near, until the player attacks it.\n\nZombies periodically make groaning sounds, which can be heard up to 16 blocks away.\n\nZombies attempt to avoid obstacles, including fall damage, fire, lava, magma blocks, and cactus and try to find the shortest path toward the player.\n\n[1] Unlike skeletons, zombies do not try to avoid being hit and continue to pursue the player even when being attacked.\n\nZombies attack baby turtles and actively seek out and destroy turtle eggs within 24 blocks horizontally and 3 blocks vertically, by jumping on them until they crack and break.\n\nZombies hunt and attack golem utility mobs within 42 blocks.\n\nIron golems and snow golems attack zombies without provocation, although snow golems deal only knockback to zombies with their snowballs.\n\nZombies target and hunt villagers within a 35\u2013 to 52.5\u2013block radius (depending on regional difficulty) [Java Edition only ] or a 16-block radius [Bedrock Edition only ] and they can always see villagers through walls.\n\nIf a zombie is attacking a villager and sees the player, it interrupts its attack on the villager to attack the player instead, even if the player has not attacked it [JE only ].\n\nOnce a zombie has targeted a villager, the zombie ignores any other villagers and the player, until its target is dead or the zombie is attacked [JE only ].\n\nAny zombie variant can transform a villager into a zombie villager.\n\nThe probability depends on the difficulty: 0% chance in Peaceful (no zombies spawn) and Easy 50% chance in Normal 100% chance in Hard Zombies target and hunt wandering traders within 35 blocks and can see traders through walls.\n\nThe zombie focuses solely on the trader unless it's attacked, or if either it or the target is killed or moved out of range, or if the trader is under the invisibility status effect.\n\nA zombie breaking down a wooden oak door.\n\nThe zombie can break only the top half of the door, not the bottom half.\n\nWhen the sun is 15 degrees or more above the ground, zombies burn once exposed to direct sunlight.\n\nBurning is suppressed when the zombie is: in a sufficiently shaded area: a sunlight level of 11 or less (a 1 block roof overhang provides sufficient protection even if it would have a sunlight level of 14); in water; wearing head armor (the helmet absorbs the damage from light but may take several day cycles to wear out completely).\n\nunder the status effect of Fire Resistance.\n\nstanding in cobwebs.\n\n[2] Transparent and translucent blocks, including glass and ice, do not prevent them from burning. [JE only ].\n\nIf they attack an entity while burning, they may set it on fire, with a (30\u00d7 regional difficulty)% chance and with a 2\u00d7floor (regional difficulty) second duration.\n\nIf wearing armor enchanted with Thorns while burning, they may set players attacking them on fire with thorns damage alone.\n\nZombies are undead mobs, harmed by the status effect Healing, healed by the status effect Instant Damage and are unaffected by Regeneration and Poison.\n\nThe wither does not attack zombies.\n\nZombies are affected by the Smite enchantment.\n\nSome zombies are capable of automatically picking up dropped items that they come across.\n\nMob heads and carved pumpkins are automatically worn on their heads.\n\nZombies can equip armor, weapons or tools.\n\nIf a zombie encounters another similar item, it may drop the previous item in favor of the new one, if: the new item is armor or a sword and the old item was not (for example, zombies prefer swords to pickaxes, and helmets to carved pumpkins), both items are armor/swords and the new item is better damage-wise (reduces higher damage for armor, or inflicts more damage for swords), both items are armor/swords with the same damage reduction/infliction, the new item has NBT tags while the old does not or the new item is more damaged than the old item, or both items are bows and the new item has NBT tags while the old does not.\n\nItems dropped by mobs in exchange for another cannot be picked up by players or mobs for 10 game ticks (0.5 seconds, barring lag), but can be picked up by hoppers.\n\nA zombie holding a picked-up item does not despawn when left alone, similar to being name tagged.\n\nZombies have a higher chance of being able to pick up items in Hard difficulty.\n\nPicked-up items do not cause the zombie to drop more experience when killed, unlike naturally-spawned gear.\n\nUp to 10% of zombies (depending on regional difficulty) in pursuit of a target bang on closed wooden doors and on Hard (and Hardcore) difficulty can succeed in breaking them down.\n\nOtherwise, the door cracks but does not break.\n\nA zombie choosing to break the door down instead of taking an alternative path.\n\nThe zombie also breaks down the door if the door is blocking its way.\n\nZombies can break only the top half of a door, meaning they cannot break a door if the zombie is facing the bottom half of the door.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Java Edition.\n\nOn all difficulty levels, damaged zombie mobs (including husks, drowned and even zombified piglins [3]) call all other zombies within a 67\u00d721\u00d767 to 111\u00d721\u00d7111 area [n 1] centered on the attacked zombie to target the attacker.\n\nIn Hard difficulty, zombies can spawn additional zombies to \"help\" when damaged.\n\nEach zombie has a \"likeliness to call reinforcements\" statistic ranging from 0\u201310%, and \"leader\" zombies (0\u20135% depending on regional difficulty) get a bonus of 50\u201375 percentage points to the stat.\n\nWhen the zombie is damaged by an entity or is damaged while targeting an entity, up to 50 attempts are made to randomly choose a spawn location (0 or \u00b17\u201340 blocks away in all three axes) that is above a block with a solid top surface, has light level 0, has no players within 7 blocks, and has no colliding entities or blocks at which to spawn the reinforcement.\n\nBoth the damaged zombie and the new zombie has a 5 percentage point penalty to their \"likeliness to call reinforcement\" stat, preventing infinite zombies from spawning this way.\n\nZombie reinforcements can spawn even in locations where naturally spawned zombies can't spawn, like mushroom fields, the End, and the Nether [4], although they still cannot spawn on blocks where other items like redstone dust or pressure plates are placed.\n\nThese effects can be negated by killing the zombie in as few hits as possible, by using environmental damage such as cactus or lava, or by avoiding them completely.\n\nThat is, if the zombified mob drops experience, it has a chance to spawn reinforcements.\n\nAdditionally, reinforcements do not spawn at all, even on Hard difficulty, if the game rule doMobSpawning is set to false.\n\nLeader zombies are a special type of zombie that spawn with an added 50-75% chance to spawn reinforcements.\n\nThe chance of a leader zombie spawning increases with clamped regional difficulty, up to a 5% chance of spawning.\n\nReinforcements zombies spawn regardless of the hostile mob cap.\n\nThey also spawn on the north-west corner of the designated block, instead of the center of the block like natural mob spawning does.\n\n[5] Zombies spawned as reinforcements cannot be zombie villagers, but they can be babies, including chicken jockeys.\n\nA husk that suffocates in water converts to a zombie.\n\nA zombie that suffocates in water converts into a drowned.\n\nIf a zombie's head is submerged in water for 30 seconds, it begins converting into a drowned.\n\nThe zombie shakes, similar to a zombie villager being cured and, after 15 seconds, the zombie becomes drowned.\n\nOnce this process starts, it cannot be stopped even if the zombie leaves water.\n\nThis time is not affected by the Respiration enchantment or the Water Breathing status effect.\n\nA newly-converted drowned always has full health even if converted from a damaged zombie.\n\nAn item being held or worn by a zombie when it becomes drowned, whether it was picked up or naturally spawned, has a 100% drop rate, which includes any naturally spawned equipment dropping with full durability [BE only ].\n\nOnly normal zombies can become drowned; zombie villagers and zombified piglins cannot be converted.\n\n[6] Husks, however, convert into zombies if they drown, and then this zombie converts into a drowned as does a normal zombie.\n\nAny husks that convert into zombies also have full health, even if the drowned husk is damaged.\n\nJava

[Java Edition only ] In Bedrock Edition, technically all zombie horses are always regarded as tamed.\n\nZombie horses are spawned with constant health of 15, speed of 0.2, and have a jump strength ranging from 0.4\u20131.0, tending toward the average 0.7.\n\nJava Edition: Zombie horses use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: \u2191 a b c d These sound events were assigned to the zombie horse, but are not called by the game \u2191 Except for stems, Nether wood, cherry wood, and bamboo wood due to MCPE-165012 Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: See also: Entity format Zombie horses have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nEntity data Additional fields for mobs that can breed Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Tags common to all horses Zombie Horses are an unsupported mob and as such issues relating to them may not be fixed.\n\nDr.\n\nZhark appears in the credits after the End Poem as the creator of horses, including zombie horses.\n\nIf a player pulling a zombie horse with a lead enters a boat, the zombie horse follows by swimming at the same speed as the boat.\n\nA player riding a zombie horse is dragged along if the zombie horse is being pulled by a lead, and can even be lifted up in the air in the same way.\n\nThe texture for zombie horses contains an unused saddlebag that has a different appearance from those of donkeys or mules.\n\nA zombie horse in a badlands biome.\n\nA zombie horse and a baby zombie horse.\n\nThe zombie horse texture file in Bedrock Edition.\n\nIt has an unused saddlebag.\n\n\u2191 https://twitter.com/jeb_/status/319938276003827712 \u2191 MC-123007 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ] Unused features View at: Template:Unused features/content [edit ]",

[Java Edition only ] If any type of zombie kills a villager, there is a chance for the villager to transform into a zombie villager.\n\nIn Java Edition a zombified zombie villager does not despawn if the player has traded with it at least once prior to its death, but unlike all other persistent mobs it still counts toward the hostile mob cap.\n\nIf the zombie villager picks up any item however, it remains persistent but is excluded from the mob cap.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition all zombified villagers are persistent.\n\nA zombie villager appears alongside a cleric villager in every igloo basement (a normal zombie villager in Bedrock Edition  [until BE 1.20.30 ] and a cleric zombie villager in Java Edition  [upcoming: BE 1.20.30 ]).\n\nOne of them transforms into a leatherworker, due to the workstation (a cauldron).\n\nThey also generate as part of abandoned villages.\n\nZombie villagers generated in both of these structures do not despawn naturally.\n\nAll mobs that can be ridden by baby zombie villagers in Bedrock Edition.\n\nBaby zombie villagers make up 5% of zombie villager spawns.\n\nThey have big heads, unlike normal baby villagers.\n\nThey behave similarly to regular zombie villagers, with the following differences: They are 30% faster than normal zombies, yet they have the same health as normal zombies.\n\nThis makes baby zombie villagers more dangerous than their bigger counterparts.\n\nThe noises they make are higher-pitched than adult zombie villager sound effects.\n\nIn Java Edition, baby zombie villagers have a chance to spawn as a chicken jockey.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, 10% of naturally spawned baby zombie villagers can start riding a mob and become a jockey when it tries attacking a villager, player, or golem.\n\nThey can ride: Adult chickens Untamed ocelots Untamed cats Untamed wolves Adult zombies Adult husks Adult zombified villagers Adult zombified piglins Cows Adult unsaddled pigs Sheep Adult untamed horses Adult untamed donkeys Adult untamed mules Adult skeleton horses Adult zombie horses Mooshrooms Spiders that was not spawned as a jockey mount Cave spiders that was not spawned as a jockey mount Pandas Baby zombie villagers turn into baby villagers, if cured.\n\nIn Java Edition, their heads turn back to small baby villager heads.\n\nWorn armor shrinks to fit their body size.\n\nThey are able to fit through 1\u00d71 block gaps.\n\nThey drop 12 experience when killed by the player instead of 5.\n\nUnlike most other baby mobs in the game, they stay as babies indefinitely and never grow into \"adult\" zombie villagers.\n\nThey have a decreased hitbox size.\n\nBaby zombie villagers are spawned when a zombie kills a baby villager, the chance of infection being the same as adult zombie villagers.\n\nBaby zombie villagers also spawn naturally, but the combined chance (5% villagers \u00d7 5% babies) is low at 0.25% (or 1 in 400 chance) of all newly spawned zombies.\n\nAlong with skeletons and regular zombies, some zombie villagers are capable of picking up dropped items.\n\nThese zombie villagers automatically pick up and hold any item that they come across (except jack o'lanterns  [Java Edition only ], mob heads and pumpkins, as these are worn on their heads), and use any armor, weapons, or tools picked up.\n\nIf they encounter another similar item, they pick it up and drop their previous item: if the new item is armor or a sword and the old item was not (for example, zombie villagers prefer swords to pickaxes and helmets to pumpkins), if both items are armor/swords and the new item is better damage-wise (reduces more damage for armor, or inflicts more damage for swords), if both items are armor/swords with the same damage reduction/infliction, the new item has NBT tags while the old does not or the new item is more damaged than the old item, or if both items are bows and the new item has NBT tags while the old does not.\n\nItems dropped by mobs in exchange for another cannot be picked up by players or mobs for 10 game ticks (0.5 seconds, barring lag), but can be picked up by hoppers.\n\nArmor worn by zombie villagers is not damaged from most damage sources, which means it cannot \"wear out\" the way player armor does.\n\nHelmets (not blocks like pumpkins) on zombie villagers can wear away and break if the zombie villager is exposed to daylight, or has an anvil or other falling block dropped on its head.\n\nZombie villagers also have a natural armor rating of 2 (), which gives 1.6 - 8% damage reduction from most sources.\n\nSome zombie villagers that are capable of picking up items spawn already in possession of such items, and those items may also be enchanted.\n\nThe chances of that event are listed below.\n\nIf a zombie villager spawns wearing multiple pieces of armor, the armor is never mismatched (i.e.\n\nall pieces are made of the same material).\n\n\u2191 a b c d e f g h i Value is based on the regional difficulty.\n\n\u2191 a b Enchantment is the same as on an enchantment table at level 5\u201322.\n\n[note 1] \u2191 1 \u2044 3 chance of an iron sword, 2 \u2044 3 chance of an iron shovel If a zombie does spawn with armor, the chances of specific armor are as follows: The chances of it being of a particular material are: Any zombie villager that spawns with equipment (picked-up items don't count) drop 1\u20133 extra experience per item.\n\nIn Java Edition  [upcoming: BE 1.20.30 ], a zombie villager retains its biome and profession after conversion from a villager.\n\nThey also retain their trades.\n\nBelow is a table of the variant and what workstation it required before zombification.\n\nThe zombie villager cannot work at a job site block.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, zombie villagers do not display their professions, but they still have the same profession after curing as before zombification.\n\nThey use the texture of an unemployed villager from their corresponding biome.\n\nBelow is a table listing the various professions, along with the specific job site block that each profession requires: \u2191 In Bedrock Edition  [until BE 1.20.30 ], all naturally spawned zombie villagers use the unemployed textures.\n\nWhen they die, zombie villagers drop 0\u20132 rotten flesh.\n\nThe maximum drop is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-5 with Looting III.\n\nThey can also drop an iron ingot, carrot, or potato when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nThis drop has a 2.5% chance of occurring, increasing by 1% per level of looting.\n\nIndividual items have the following chances of dropping: 1 \u2044 120 (about 0.83%) 7 \u2044 600 (about 1.17%) with Looting I 9 \u2044 600 (1.50%) with Looting II 11 \u2044 600 (about 1.83%) with Looting III Any picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping on death or when cured and drops with the same damage level it had when picked up.\n\nCarved Pumpkin [note 1] Jack o'Lantern  [Java Edition only ] [note 1] Iron Shovel Iron Sword Random Armor Zombie villagers have an 8.5% chance of dropping their naturally-spawned equipment (other than Halloween pumpkins), and drop it with a random durability.\n\nEach level of Looting increases the chance 1 percentage point (11.5% with Looting III).\n\n\u2191 a b Zombie villagers spawn with pumpkins and jack o'lanterns  [Java Edition only ] only during Halloween.\n\nAdult zombie villagers drop 5 and an additional 1\u20133 per naturally-spawned equipment.\n\nBaby zombie villagers drop 12 experience.\n\nMain article: Zombie \u00a7 Behavior Zombie villagers behave as ordinary zombies, except that they do not convert to drowned when submerged.\n\nIn Java Edition, zombie villagers that were converted from villagers retain their professions and clothes, which gain a tattered appearance.\n\nNaturally spawned zombie villagers (or ones spawned with spawn eggs) have a random profession that is not retained upon being cured; instead, they become unemployed and may gain a new profession if a job site block is nearby.\n\nZombie villagers can also spawn with the unemployed or Nitwit outfits.\n\nZombified nitwits remain nitwits after being cured.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, all zombie villagers have the same appearance, which looks like an unemployed zombie villager.\n\nNaturally spawned zombie villagers (or ones spawned with spawn eggs) have a random profession that is retained upon being cured.\n\nHowever, the profession is not locked and the cured villager may gain a new profession if in a village with an available job site block.\n\nZombie villagers can be unemployed, but they cannot be nitwits (zombified nitwit villagers become unemployed zombie villagers).\n\nBaby zombie villagers are always unemployed.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Curing a zombie villager Zombie villagers can be cured (converted to normal villagers) by first giving them the Weakness effect, which can be applied by: A splash potion of Weakness thrown by the player, a dispenser, or a witch.\n\nAn area effect cloud of Weakness from a creeper explosion [Java Edition only ], or a lingering potion.\n\nAn arrow of Weakness.\n\nThe / effect command, if cheats are enabled.\n\nThe weakened zombie villager must then be healed by using a (non-enchanted) golden apple on them.\n\nThe zombie villager begins to shudder to signal that curing is in progress.\n\nAlso, the Weakness effect is removed, replaced by Strength for the duration of the curing process.\n\nAn internal countdown timer is then started, counting down the total time to cure.\n\nTime to cure is initially 2000 ticks (nominally, 100 seconds or 1m 40s) in Bedrock Edition or a random integer between 3600 and 6000 ticks (180 to 300 seconds, 3\u20145 minutes) in Java Edition.\n\nOn each tick, there is a 1% chance for the game to look for cure accelerants.\n\nIt checks each block within a 9\u00d79\u00d79 cube centered on the villager for either an iron bar or a bed (either half: they're detected separately).\n\nFor each one found up to 14, there is a 30% chance of decreasing the countdown timer by 1 more tick.\n\nTherefore, having at least 14 half-beds and/or iron bars within range speeds up conversion by an average of 4.2%.\n\n[1] During the curing process the zombie villager behaves like a normal zombie except that it gains Strength (with a potency that doesn't depend on the difficulty level).\n\nThus, a zombie villager is more dangerous during curing than at other times.\n\nAt the end of the curing process, the zombie villager transforms into a villager and gains the Nausea effect for 10 seconds (which has no effect on the villager's behavior).\n\nIf it was holding any item it picked up, that item is dropped (unless it was enchanted with Curse of Binding, in which case it remains in the villager's inventory but is not worn and will not be dropped if the villager is killed).\n\nIf it was a baby before it was transformed into a zombie villager, it remains a baby after the cure.\n\nIf it had traded with a player at least once, it recovers its former profession and inventory of trades.\n\nOtherwise, it recovers its profession but might immediately change it if it finds and claims a workstation block for a different profession.\n\nA newly-cured villager, if it had a profession prior to being zombified, offers a trading discount to the player who administered the cure.\n\nThese discounts are permanent.\n\nIf a villager is cured more than once, the discounts get deeper until the price reaches the minimum of one emerald.\n\nVillagers near the cured villager are also affected but offer fewer, smaller discounts.\n\nZombie villagers that are in the process of converting do not despawn if the player moves far away from them, but like all monsters, they despawn if the difficulty is changed to Peaceful.\n\nIf a zombie villager spawned as a nitwit or was a nitwit before it was transformed into a zombie villager, it remains a nitwit if cured.\n\nCuring a villager spreads minor_positive gossip through the villager gossip system.\n\nA former nitwit zombie villager becomes an unemployed villager and can learn a profession after the cure.\n\nVillagers who were unemployed before transforming into a zombie villager might immediately claim a workstation to gain a profession.\n\nVillagers in a range of 16 blocks in a cube surrounding the cured villager also offer a small discount proportional to the number of cured villagers (up to 10).\n\nSaving and reloading the world causes the curing process to finish as soon as the chunk containing the villager is ticked.\n\nThis does not happen if the player moves out of range, then returns: In that case, the countdown timer pauses until the player returns.\n\nJava Edition: Zombie villagers use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b MC-226770 \u2191 MC-218122 Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Zombie villagers have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nJava Edition: Main article:

[Java Edition only ] This is not dropped, even if killed with Looting.\n\nZombified piglins spawn in groups of 4 [JE only ] / 2-4 [BE only ] in the Nether at light level 11 and below on most blocks other than nether wart block.\n\nThey spawn most commonly in nether wastes, frequently in nether fortresses, uncommonly in crimson forests and are sometimes found riding striders in lava oceans.\n\nWhen a nether portal block in the Overworld receives a random tick, there is a chance of 1 \u2044 2000 (0.05%) on Easy, 1 \u2044 1000 (0.1%) on Normal and 3 \u2044 2000 (0.15%) on Hard for it to spawn a zombified piglin.\n\nIn Java Edition, they appear inside one of the portal blocks on the bottom.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, they spawn one block to the east or south of the portal (depending on which direction the portal is facing).\n\nNeither slabs nor lighting prevents this.\n\n\"Portal ticking\" can be used to increase the rate of zombified piglin spawning by repeatedly lighting and breaking a nether portal.\n\nZombified piglin spawning via this process is completely independent of the mob cap, similar to the spawning of phantoms in Java Edition, which means they can still spawn if there are a sufficient number of hostile mobs in the world.\n\nZombified piglins who spawn in this way cannot travel to the Nether for a preset amount of time, whether they walk through the portal they spawned in or through nearby portals. [Java Edition only ] A zombified piglin spawns when lightning strikes within 4 blocks of a pig.\n\nIf the pig is a piglet, it then transforms into a baby zombified piglin.\n\nA piglin or piglin brute that enters the Overworld or the End transforms into a zombified piglin after 15 seconds.\n\nWhen piglins wielding crossbows zombify, they keep their crossbows, but are unable to use them, and perform melee attack like other zombified piglins.\n\nWhen baby piglins zombify, they do not have weapons, unlike baby zombified piglins that naturally spawn.\n\nWhen piglin brutes zombify, they keep their axes.\n\nThe newly zombified piglin gets the Nausea effect for 10 seconds.\n\nThis is a purely visual effect, and does not affect the mob's behavior.\n\nA zombified piglin keeps any armor or weapons collected before being zombified [JE only ].\n\nBaby zombified piglins also have a 5% chance of becoming a chicken jockey [Java Edition only ].\n\nIf a piglin is in the middle of bartering and gets zombified while inspecting a gold ingot, it drops the ingot when it turns into a zombified piglin.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Zombified piglin farming 0\u20131 rotten flesh.\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-4 with Looting III.\n\n0\u20131 gold nugget s.\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-4 with Looting III.\n\n1 gold ingot (2.5% chance) if killed by a player or tamed wolf, or upon death when angry.\n\nThe chance is increased by 1% per level of Looting, for a maximum of 5.5% with Looting III.\n\nThere is an 8.5% [JE only ] or 25% [BE only ] chance to drop their original weapon if killed by a player or tamed wolf, or upon death when angry.\n\nThe chance is increased by 1% [JE only ] or 5% [BE only ] per level of Looting, for a maximum of 11.5% [JE only ] or 40% [BE only ] with Looting III.\n\nThe death animation does not include the weapon if it was dropped.\n\ngolden sword (sometimes enchanted) golden axe if zombified from a piglin brute crossbow if zombified from a piglin warped fungus on a stick if spawned riding a strider After a piglin transforms into a zombified piglin, it drops any acquired armor and held weapons upon death.\n\n5 for adults or 12 for babies if killed by a player or a tamed wolf, or dies while in an angered state [1].\n\nAn additional 1\u20133 is dropped if it does not drop its golden sword upon death.\n\nZombified piglins wander aimlessly about when idle.\n\nThey move at 2.28 m/s and are immune to fire and lava.\n\nWhen provoked, their speed increases to 3.38 m/s or faster for babies.\n\nIn Java Edition, like zombies, zombified piglins can attack wooden doors and may break them on Hard difficulty.\n\n[2] In Normal and Hard difficulties, up to 55% [JE only ] or 25% [BE only ] of zombified piglins pick up any armor pieces and swords better than their golden one, which they always drop when killed.\n\nThis also prevents them from despawning.\n\nZombified piglins may pick up an illager banner next to it [BE only ] as pillagers do.\n\n[3] Zombified piglins try to destroy any turtle eggs they see within 23 blocks away horizontally and 3 blocks away vertically (10 blocks horizontally and 2 blocks vertically in Bedrock Edition), not counting the block they are standing in.\n\nWhen a zombified piglin is first spawned, it always detects nearby turtle eggs after exactly 2 seconds, as long as there are two blocks of air above it.\n\nHowever, if the turtle egg is placed after the zombified piglin spawned, the zombified piglin takes some time to notice the turtle egg and try to break it.\n\nZombified piglins avoid walking near magma blocks and cannot jump over magma blocks one block high.\n\nIf a zombified piglin is surrounded by magma block wall one block height or higher, it gets near those surrounding magma blocks surrounding them.\n\nIf a zombified piglin spawns on or is pushed onto magma blocks, it pathfinds normally on the magma.\n\nZombified piglins do not retreat from zoglins, soul torches/lanterns, soul fire or soul campfires.\n\nZoglins attack zombified piglins on sight, causing a retaliation.\n\nZombified piglins are not distracted by gold, and cannot barter, unlike piglins.\n\nThey also do not follow players that are holding a gold ingot or another gold item.\n\nVillagers and wandering traders run away from zombified piglins, despite them being passive to villagers and wandering traders. [BE only ] In addition, piglins squeal in distress and flee from zombified piglins if they get too close.\n\nZombified piglins ignore piglins unless provoked, which can happen when a piglin with a crossbow shoots a zombified piglin by accident.\n\nZombified piglins will not become aggressive if a player attacks and/or kills a regular piglin.\n\nIron golems attack zombified piglins, which causes other zombified piglins to attack the iron golem.\n\nA zombified piglin is neutral to every mob that can attack, but they retaliate and gang up on any mob that provokes them.\n\nUndead, they are: Damaged by the status effect Instant Health and healed by the status effect Instant Damage.\n\nThrowing an instant damage splash potion does not anger them, since it heals them.\n\nUnaffected by the status effects Regeneration and Poison.\n\nIgnored by the wither and affected by Smite.\n\nUnable to swim in water, but do not drown.\n\nZombified piglins are not initially hostile, but all zombified piglins within a 67\u00d722\u00d767 to 111\u00d722\u00d7111 area [JE only ] or a 20-block radius [BE only ] centered on an attacked zombified piglin become aggressive and converge on the attacker (another mob or player, except goats and ghasts) if any individual is attacked, unless the zombified piglin attacked is killed in one hit.\n\n[4]  [JE only ] They make an aggressive sound when angered.\n\nIn addition, some zombified piglins have the ability to spawn reinforcements when attacked (similar to zombies and which can rarely include actual zombies). [JE only ] This applies to any hit registered as coming from the player or other mobs, whether its accidentally or purposefully, which includes deflected ghast fireballs, sweep attacks, snowballs and eggs, fireworks shot from crossbows, TNT, or a skeleton arrow.\n\nArrows shot from dispensers or bed explosions [5] don't provoke zombified piglins.\n\nDuration: A zombified piglin can remain hostile indefinitely if it is both within the follow range of the zombified piglin (33 to 55 blocks), and has a direct line of sight with the player.\n\nHowever, breaking one of those conditions causes a hostile zombified piglin to return neutral after a \"forgiveness timer\" expires.\n\nIn Java Edition, this timer ranges from 20 seconds to 55 seconds, whereas in Bedrock Edition it is always 25 seconds.\n\nThe forgiveness timer does not advance for zombified piglins in unloaded chunks.\n\nTherefore, if the player enters a nether portal and returns, any provoked zombified piglins in the area remain aggressive (unless another player was nearby to keep the chunks loaded).\n\nA player's death causes zombified piglins to become neutral toward the player if the gamerule forgiveDeadPlayers is true. [JE only ] A hostile zombified piglin can also \"sound an alarm\", spreading the aggro to all zombified piglins within a 67\u00d722\u00d767 to 111\u00d722\u00d7111 area  [JE only ] or 20-block [BE only ] radius.\n\nA hostile zombified piglin does this whenever the targeted player is within their follow range (33 to 55 blocks) and has a constant line-of-sight with its target, then it does the same every 4\u20136 seconds (80-120 game ticks), recruiting any formerly-neutral peers.\n\nThey pursue players even if they have the Invisibility effect.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a nearby neutral zombified piglin prevents a player from sleeping, as if it were a hostile mob.\n\nHostile zombified piglins have slightly different path finding than when they are neutral.\n\nFor example, they would fall off edges that would cause them fall damage in attempt to reach the attacker where most other mobs would otherwise not do.\n\nWhen a zombified piglin is angered, the normal piglins do not get aggressive, and vice versa.\n\nUnlike other zombie variants, zombified piglins do not attack villagers and wandering traders.\n\nIf caught in the Nether with few items or no gold armor, staying near zombified piglins is a good strategy in Java edition.\n\nAggravated piglins will be too afraid to approach the player, and any nearby skeletons shooting at the player will be quickly killed by the zombified piglins.\n\nThey do not become angry at the player if a mob hits them while trying to attack the player, though they have done so in versions of Pocket Edition.\n\nJava Edition: Zombified piglins use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b MC-226770 \u2191 \"[MC-218122] Unused sound event: minecraft:entity.zombie.attack_iron_door - Jira\" \u2013 Mojira, March 8, 2021.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Zombified piglins have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Additional fields for mobs that can become angry Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Tags common to all zombies Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Zombified Piglin\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe pre- Texture Update zombie pigman texture file has \"THX XAPHOBIA\" written on the unused section as a credit by Notch to the skin's original creator.\n\nDeaths of hostile zombified piglins always register as kills by the player they are targeting, regardless of whether that player ever touched that zombified piglin.\n\n[1]  [Java Edition only ] The zombified piglin's angry sound is played twice the speed of the original sound file in the game. [JE only ] Applying the Classic Texture Pack changes the zombified piglin's model and texture back to a zombie pigman. [Bedrock Edition only ] There is a glitch where the zombified piglin texture appears as the zombie pigman even without the Classic Texture Pack. [Bedrock Edition only ] In Minecraft Legends, Piglins don't zombify in the Overworld because they breathe in Nether Wart spores.\n\n[11] In the Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nepisode Girl in the Flower Dress, Jemma Simmons mentions a zombified piglin (known as zombie pigman at the time) as the \"rather nasty mob\" in one of the episode's fictional character's \"runs\" in Minecraft.\n\n[12] In the 15 Year map, the Zombified Piglin uses the Piglin's sound files as opposed to its own.\n\nA zombified piglin with a crossbow that can be found only when a piglin with a crossbow is zombified in the Overworld.\n\nA zombified piglin riding a strider.\n\nA zombified piglin chicken jockey.

[Java Edition only ] A blaze flies when it acquires a target, slowly approaching while attempting to remain from 0.5 to 3.5 blocks above the target.\n\nA blaze's normal attack is a trio of small fireballs, shot from up to 48 blocks [Java Edition only ] or 16 blocks. [Bedrock Edition only ] A blaze shoots only when it has a clear line of sight to its target.\n\nIf line of sight is broken in the middle of its volley, the blaze suspends the remainder of its volley until line of sight returns.\n\nWhen using this attack, the blaze burns with fire for 3 seconds, shoots three small fireballs over the course of 0.9 seconds, then extinguishes its flames and waits for 5 seconds before attacking again.\n\nA blaze shoots its small fireballs with roughly the same lack of accuracy as a dispenser; however, the blaze's shots maintain the same speed all the way to the target, unlike the dispenser's, which start slow and accelerate.\n\nA blaze that touches its target performs a melee attack that does 6 damage on normal difficulty, once per second.\n\nThis attack is not considered fire damage and does not ignite the target.\n\nThis cannot be prevented by the Fire Resistance status effect.\n\nJava Edition: Blazes use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Main article: Entity format Blazes have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nEntity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nFor information specifically pertaining to small fireballs, see Small Fireball \u00a7 History.\n\nIssues relating to \"Blaze\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nBlazes can see the player through walls.\n\nWhen throwing a potion of Invisibility on a blaze, the smoke remains visible.\n\nAccording to Jens Bergensten, blazes look the way they do because all mobs in Minecraft are cuboid-shape, so to make them flame-like and magical, he created them as a core surrounded by rotating rods.\n\n[3] Blazes originally didn't have eyes when Jens Bergensten was first creating them and \"just looked like a yellow rock\".\n\nEyes were added to \"give it more personality\".\n\n[4] Despite not having visible feet, blazes are still capable of making footstep sounds.\n\n[5] According to Minecraft's \"Visit the Nether!\" blazes are sentient beings made of pure lava.\n\nThe article theorizes they were created by the original inhabitants of nether fortresses to serve as guards, but their creators lost control over the blazes and were subsequently destroyed by them.\n\n[6] On the official T-shirt \"Alchemy\" by JINX, the blaze is in the form of the Vitruvian Man and the text uses the Standard Galactic Alphabet.\n\nThe words on the outside of the ring translate to: \"nigredo\", \"albedo\", \"citrinitas\", and \"rubedo\" [note 1] which are all relating to magnum opus.\n\nThe words on the ring translate to (starting from the top): \"B * Crowmer\", \"poison * speed\", \"strenth * resist\" [sic ], \"vision * heal\", and \"regeneration\" relating to potions and probably the artist's name.\n\nOn the connecting lines the words translate to: \"potln of thickness\" [sic ], \"potln of awkward\" [sic ], \"weakness potion\" and \"mundane potion\" relating to base potions.\n\nAs part of an official collaboration, blazes are included as monsters in a free add-on for the roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n[7] In the game, they are \"Elementals\" and have the alignment \"Typically Neutral Evil\".\n\nA close up look at a blaze spawner in a Nether fortress.\n\nZoomed out view of the blaze spawner, showing the spawner area and a spawned blaze.\n\nMultiple blazes shooting small fireballs at the player as they hover around their spawner.\n\nA Blaze that was spawned in the Overworld is taking damage from snowy weather.\n\n(Before 20w06a) Disabling a blaze spawner with 9 glowstone blocks.\n\nGlowstone can be replaced with other light sources of light level 15.\n\nA triggered blaze preparing to attack who still hasn't flown.\n\nA triggered blaze preparing to attack with fire around it, floating on the wall of a Nether fortress.\n\nA blaze and a wither skeleton idling in a Nether fortress.\n\nTwo blazes spawned near a blaze spawner and a wither skeleton.\n\nBlazes spawned by a spawner.\n\nA blaze spawner platform with blazes.\n\nA blaze without particles.\n\nThe Blaze as it appears in Minecraft: Story Mode.\n\nThe Blaze as it appears in Minecraft Dungeons.\n\nOfficial LEGO Blaze minifigure.\n\nOfficial T-shirt artwork \"Alchemy\" featuring a blaze.\n\nMade by JINX.\n\nOfficial blaze statistics for D&D.\n\n\u2191 There is a nether track titled Rubedo.\n\n\u2191 https://youtu.be/enIW9AJ1Zxk \u2191 MC-194697 \u2191 https://minecraft.net/en-us/article/meet-blaze \u2191 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3TXUTLClb0&t=0s \u2191 MC-92623 \u2191 \"Visit the Nether!\" by Duncan Geere.\n\nMinecraft.net, November 10, 2019 \u2191 https://www.dndbeyond.com/claim/source/minecraft-creatures-monstrous-compendium Meet the Blaze \u2013 Minecraft.net on December 20, 2016 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

can be attached to a lead.\n\nChickens spawn naturally in the Overworld in groups of four above grass blocks with two blocks of free space above it at a light level of nine or more.\n\nChickens do not spawn in deserts, snowy plains, ice spikes, snowy slopes, meadows, wooded badlands, jagged peaks, frozen peaks and stony peaks.\n\nIn Java Edition, chickens are more common in sparse jungles.\n\nChickens spawn individually after the world generation and 5% of chickens spawn as baby chickens.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, chickens require a light level of 7 or more to spawn and spawn in groups of two to four during the world generation.\n\nMain article: Chicken Jockey All baby zombie variants and baby zombified piglins have a 5% chance to spawn riding a chicken, forming a chicken jockey.\n\nBecause a baby zombie occurs from 5% of zombie spawns, the chicken jockey spawns consist of 0.25% of all zombie spawns in a chicken-free environment; if chickens are present, the chance increases to 0.4875%.\n\nA chicken jockey can also be spawned by using the following command: / summon minecraft:chicken ~ ~ ~ {IsChickenJockey:1b,Passengers:[{id:\"minecraft:zombie\",IsBaby:1b}]} Chicken jockeys may spawn with items equipped.\n\nBaby zombified piglin versions of the chicken jockey always wield a golden sword.\n\nHarming or killing the chicken does not cause the zombified piglin to attack.\n\nChickens spawn in the Nether in this way.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, baby zombie jockeys do not spawn riding chickens, but check for nearby adult chickens to mount prior to attacking the player, a wandering trader, an adult villager, a snow golem or an iron golem.\n\nMain article: Tutorials/Chicken farming Adult chickens that were not part of chicken jockeys lay an egg every five

cubic area, while a baby chicken follows adult chickens.\n\nChickens uniquely attempt to jump up to climb stairs instead of climbing them normally.\n\n[1] Chickens avoid falling off cliffs and flap their wings when they are in mid air and fall slowly, thus they are immune to fall damage.\n\nWhen harmed, chickens flee around for a two seconds.\n\nOcelots and foxes pursue and attack chickens.\n\nWhile in a loaded chunk, an adult chicken lays an egg every five to ten minutes (from 6000 to 12000 in-game ticks), unless it is or was, a part of a chicken jockey.\n\nIf the player is close enough to a chicken when it lays an egg, an indicative sound is heard.\n\nChickens stay underwater for 15 seconds or can swim, visibly flapping their wings and staying on the water

grow up in approximately three seconds using 56 seeds.\n\nBaby chickens are smaller than a half-block and can unwillingly pass through openings smaller than a full block, but do not walk through half-block-tall spaces.\n\nA baby chicken riding a minecart cannot be hit because it is completely inside the minecart's hitbox.\n\nMain article: Tutorials/Egg farming Chickens are an Overworld mob that can repopulate without breeding.\n\nAdult chickens lay eggs at random and an egg thrown at the ground by a player or a dispenser has a 1 \u2044 8 chance of spawning a baby chicken.\n\nIf a baby chicken spawns from a thrown egg, there is a further 1 \u2044 32 chance to spawn three extra baby chickens or 1 \u2044 256 overall.\n\nIt is theoretically possible for a stack of 16 eggs to yield 64 chickens if all spawn chances succeed for all eggs.\n\nIf the player throws an egg at a glass pane, the baby chicken can spawn on the far side of the pane.\n\nAs chickens can produce each other with eggs, they're perhaps the only passive mob you can farm with just a single individual, if you're willing to wait patiently and constantly throw eggs.\n\nJava Edition: Chickens use the Friendly

zombie, baby zombified piglin, baby zombie villager, baby husk, or baby drowned riding a chicken.\n\nEach baby zombie, baby husk, baby zombie villager, baby zombified piglin, or baby drowned that spawns has a 5% chance to check for an existing chicken within a 10\u00d76\u00d710 box centered on the baby's spawn location and spawn riding one of those chickens if there are any.\n\nIf it fails that 5% chance, there is an additional 5% chance of the baby zombie spawning mounted on a new chicken.\n\nIn a chicken-free environment, each spawned zombie has a 0.25% chance of becoming a chicken jockey; if chickens are present, the chance increases to 0.4875%.\n\nChicken jockeys may spawn with items equipped.\n\nBaby zombified piglin versions of the chicken jockey always have a golden sword equipped, while baby drowned versions may have a trident.\n\nAlthough chickens take damage from magma blocks, baby zombified piglin jockeys still spawn on them, killing the chicken and leaving just the baby zombified piglin.\n\nProvoking the zombified piglin chicken jockey causes it to attack, like a normal zombified piglin.\n\nMain articles: Chicken \u00a7 Drops, Zombie \u00a7 Drops, Drowned \u00a7 Drops and Zombified Piglin \u00a7 Drops The rider and the chicken each have separate drops when that part of the chicken jockey is killed.\n\nTheir drops are no different than if the zombie (or zombified piglin, zombie villager, husk, or drowned) and the chicken were standing alone.\n\nChicken jockeys fall slowly and do not take fall damage, like normal chickens.\n\nThe chicken can run through 1 block high gaps.\n\nThe baby zombie suffocates unless the above block is transparent.\n\nThe baby zombie can pick up/equip items.\n\nThe chicken (unless spawned with commands without the IsChickenJockey tag) does not lay eggs.\n\n[2] However, they can still be bred with other chickens.\n\nChicken jockeys (both zombies and chickens [3]) despawn like zombies.\n\nThe chicken becomes

chance for a baby zombie villager to spawn wearing full enchanted diamond armor holding an enchanted iron sword in its left hand while riding a chicken is about 1 in 2.91082\u00d710 22, easily making it the rarest mob in the game.\n\nZombified piglin chicken jockeys can spawn from portals in the Overworld.\n\nAlso, a normal chicken jockey may spawn in the Nether if a zombified piglin calls a normal zombie as reinforcement.\n\nName tags prevent the chickens from despawning, and they can be bred to spawn normal egg-laying, non-despawning chickens.\n\nTo prevent a chicken jockey from despawning, only the chicken needs to be name tagged, because riders of other entities never despawn.\n\nThe wither attempts to attack the chicken being ridden by the zombie and the zombie also takes damage.\n\nA zombified piglin chicken jockey does not become hostile if the chicken is killed or attacked.\n\nIn Java Edition, if a zombie villager chicken jockey is cured, then the villager continues

they also make loud and lengthy sounds while being stared at.\n\nIf the player continues to maintain eye contact, the enderman does not move [Java Edition only ], although it may teleport away.\n\nOnce the player stops looking at the enderman, it runs toward the back of the player to attack, although it ceases if hit by another player or mob.\n\n[2] An aggravated enderman runs fast and often teleports to the location of a player or mob up to 32 blocks away (orthogonally).\n\nEndermen are not provoked by a player viewing it through a transparent block or while wearing a carved pumpkin.\n\nAn aggravated enderman pursues the player until it is either killed or distracted by external elements, such as rain or fire.\n\nThey do not take damage from sunlight like undead mobs, but when at a sufficient light level under the sky during the day they teleport randomly, typically winding up in caves (although certain non-full blocks, such as soul sand and mud, also register as \"dark\" when the enderman is standing in them).\n\nEndermen can be harmed by melee attacks, water, lava, fire, splash water bottles, or rain.\n\nThey are not damaged when standing in a filled cauldron  [Java Edition only ].\n\n[3] Endermen teleport away when they take damage from any of natural sources (1), continuing to do so until they find a safe location.\n\nThey also teleport while taking damage from other sources, such as suffocation, Poison, or Wither.\n\nRanged attacks are largely ineffective against endermen, as they teleport when hit by a projectile instead of taking damage.\n\nEndermen that are hit by projectiles do not become hostile.\n\n[4] Arrows  [Java Edition only ] and tridents appear to bounce off an enderman who is unable to teleport.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, arrows go straight through endermen that are unable to teleport (but the effect still goes through if it's a tipped arrow).\n\n[needs in-game testing ].\n\nRocket crossbows do affect endermen and can trigger endermen hostility toward the shooter.\n\nEndermen can step up one full block without having to jump.\n\nEndermen are hostile to endermites within 64 blocks but are passive to other mobs unless provoked.\n\nAn enderman in a player's vicinity prevents the player from sleeping in a bed at night as if any hostile mob were nearby.\n\nIf the player is already asleep in a bed, it is possible for an enderman to teleport on it and wake players by pushing them off.\n\nThe endermen's aggression range for being looked at is reduced when the player is sneaking, or under the Invisibility effect depending on the number of armor pieces currently worn.\n\nThe detection range in blocks for invisible players is shown in the following table: They play a sound exclusively at the teleportation destination.\n\n[5] Each teleportation attempt chooses a random destination 32 blocks along each axis (i.e.\n\na 64\u00d764\u00d764 cube centered on the current position).\n\nIt then applies the following checks: As long as the selected block is not a made of a movement-blocking material, seek downwards.\n\nIf the found block is waterlogged, the teleportation attempt fails.\n\nStarting again with the originally selected target, seek downwards as long as the block below is not a made of a movement-blocking material.\n\nThe teleportation attempt succeeds if no liquid or solid blocks prevent them from standing at the destination.\n\nThus, endermen need at least three non-solid blocks above the destination to successfully teleport, and do not teleport to waterlogged blocks unless the ceiling above is made of a non-waterlogged movement-blocking material.\n\n[6] Blocks that have a large enough collision box but are not made of a movement-blocking material, such as carpet that is not above a block made of a movement-blocking material, snow layers 10 or more deep, and azalea, can be used to prevent teleportation.\n\nEndermen always teleport an integer Y distance, so an enderman at Y=70.0 cannot teleport onto a movement-blocking block covered by a single carpet, snow layers only 2 deep, or many other short blocks, while an enderman at Y=70.99 could teleport onto snow layers 8 or 9 deep.\n\nEndermen always attempt to teleport upon taking damage.\n\nMost melee attacks are successful, but the enderman usually teleports a few blocks behind the player when hit, if there is space behind the player.\n\nEndermen can be attacked with projectiles if they are in a boat or minecart. [Java Edition only ] If all available blocks within teleport distance are removed or unavailable as a destination, it is possible to hit endermen in Java Edition with a projectile, although arrows may simply bounce off, dealing no damage.\n\n[7] When teleporting due to damage, it makes 64 attempts to teleport.\n\nIn Java Edition, an enderman cannot teleport while it is in a minecart or boat, although in rain and water it attempts to do so, always teleporting back repeatedly until death.\n\nThis does not occur in Bedrock Edition.\n\n[8] Unlike any other mobs, which cannot hold blocks except as items, endermen have a unique ability to pick up, carry and set down certain blocks.\n\nThey silently [9] pick up blocks in a 4\u00d73\u00d74 (xyz) region horizontally centered on the enderman and vertically encompassing it.\n\nAn enderman cannot pick up blocks in a completely flat area.\n\nEndermen drop the block they are holding upon death as an item, although they do not visually let go of the block when dying.\n\n[10] [11] It does not despawn while holding a block.\n\nEndermen cannot place blocks onto bedrock or entities.\n\nEndermen can pick up the following blocks: Cactus Clay Coarse Dirt Rooted Dirt Dirt Flowers (short) Fungi Roots Grass Block Gravel Melon Moss Block Mud Muddy Mangrove Roots Mushrooms Mycelium Nylium Podzol Pumpkins Red Sand Sand TNT Data packs from Java Edition can change this list by modifying the minecraft:enderman_holdable block tag.\n\nBedrock Edition behavior packs can not modify these as the list is hard-coded behind the minecraft:behavior.enderman_take_block method.\n\nWhile carrying a block, the enderman sometimes silently [12] places it in a 2\u00d72\u00d72 region horizontally centered on the enderman and vertically at the same level as the enderman itself if the target location is air with a non-air block beneath and the block is allowed to be placed at the target location.\n\nEndermen cannot pick up or place down blocks if the game rule mobGriefing is set to false.\n\nEndermen can randomly breach walls, bridge fences, break redstone circuitry, set off explosions and kill themselves if they place a block of TNT on a power source and even construct golems by removing or placing blocks.\n\nEndermen can pick up or place down blocks even when angry.\n\nIn Java Edition, users can summon an enderman holding any block (including the ones not listed above) using the carriedBlockState NBT data.\n\nFor example, to summon an enderman holding a grass block with no AI where the player is standing: /summon minecraft:enderman ~ ~ ~ {NoAI:1,carriedBlockState:{Name:\"grass_block\"}} Java Edition: Endermen use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock

maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe developers have stated that the belief that enderman sounds are backward distortions is just speculation.\n\n[21] Notch claimed in public that the enderman is a \"subtle reference\" to the Slenderman, a similar-looking monster with a similar name.\n\nGiven the later development of the End, it is possible he already had the name in mind, and did not choose it because of the Reddit thread in which their name was revealed.\n\n[22] According to Burnie Burns, former CEO of Rooster Teeth, the idea for endermen's weakness to water came from his son JD during a visit to Mojang's headquarters.\n\n[23] Dinnerbone suggested \"a haunting of endermen\" as the collective noun for Endermen.\n\n[24] Additionally, in the third episode of Minecraft: Story Mode, The Last Place You Look, a player is given the option to correct the grammar of other characters by specifying that the collective noun for a group of endermen is \"a haunting of Endermen\".\n\nIn the fourth Minecraft novel Minecraft: The End, the collective term used by endermen themselves is \"an End of Endermen\".\n\nSwitching to spectator mode and taking an enderman's point of view adds a shader that inverts colors, suggesting that they see the End as an island of blue cobblestone (as end stone is a yellowish version of cobblestone with inverted colors) in a white sky, with white pillars, white endermen with green eyes and a white ender dragon, also with green eyes.\n\nThey also see cobblestone as end stone.\n\nThe texture for an enderman's eyes is located in a different texture file than the body, allowing their eyes to glow.\n\nBecause the two textures do not line up perfectly, forcing an enderman to look straight up causes its eyes to turn blank white.\n\nThis also causes the enderman's eyes to be visible even when under the Invisibility effect.\n\nThe enderman teleportation sound also plays when a player teleports using an ender pearl  [Bedrock Edition only ] or chorus fruit.\n\nThe enderman is a playable DLC character in the crossover fighting game Super Smash Bros.\n\nUltimate as an alternate costume for Steve, though with altered proportions to be at Steve's height.\n\nAdditionally, there is an enderman \"spirit\" that makes the user vulnerable to damage by water, as are regular endermen.\n\nEndermen are trying to bring about the collapse to all dimensions, as revealed in the 2019 book Minecraft Game Design.\n\n[25] Enderman holding a grass block Enderman holding sand Enderman holding a cactus Enderman holding TNT Enderman

In Bedrock Edition, two ghasts can spawn within any 4 chunk span.\n\nGhasts do not spawn in nether fortresses, but they can wander nearby.\n\nGhast tear (0\u20131).\n\nLooting increases the maximum ghast tears dropped by one per level, for a maximum of 4 ghast tears with Looting III.\n\nGunpowder (0\u20132).\n\nLooting increases the maximum gunpowder dropped by one per level, for a maximum of 5 gunpowder with Looting III.\n\n5 when killed by the player.\n\nGhasts float around the Nether with their eyes and mouth closed and periodically make crying sounds, which can be heard from up to 80 blocks away.\n\nThey have a hitbox of 4\u00d74\u00d74 blocks, as well as nine tentacles that are not included in the hitbox.\n\nWhen within range, a ghast faces the player and shoots a fireball every 3 seconds, opening its eyes and mouth and making a screeching sound.\n\nA ghast requires a line of sight to the player before firing, which can be blocked by any solid block including transparent blocks.\n\nIn Java Edition, they target players within 64 blocks horizontally and 4 blocks vertically [1], and continue attacking as long as they are within a 64 block sphere and have line of sight.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a ghast normally targets a player within a sphere of 28 blocks, increasing to 64 blocks if the player damages it.\n\nGhasts can cause other mobs to attack them, but in Java Edition they never target other mobs, only the player.\n\nUnlike most other hostile mobs, ghasts do not attempt to approach the player once aggravated, but instead fire at the player from their position within firing range.\n\nWhen at close range, ghasts may take damage and die from their own fireball explosions.\n\nGhasts can be set on fire, but fire or lava does not harm them.\n\nWhen a ghast sinks into lava, or crosses a lava fall, its speed drops and it is immobilized for a while, making it more vulnerable to arrow shots.\n\nDespite their ghostly appearance, ghasts are not considered undead mobs.\n\n[2] This means they can drown, [3] are damaged by Instant Damage [4] and healed by Instant Health, are affected by Poison, [5] and are not affected by Smite.\n\n[6] Although they are not undead mobs, ghasts are never targeted by withers deliberately.\n\n[7] Despite that they are flying mobs, ghasts can destroy turtle eggs when on top of them.\n\n[8] Fireball Behavior Does not exist Details Size Height: JE: 1 Block BE: 0.31 blocks Width: JE: 1 Block BE: 0.31 blocks Main article: Fireball Ghasts shoot fireballs at players, dealing damage to nearby blocks and entities.\n\nJava Edition: Ghasts use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b c d MC-218108 \u2191 a b MC-177079 Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Main article: Entity format Ghasts have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nEntity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs ExplosionPower: The radius of the explosion created by the fireballs the ghast fires.\n\nDefault value is 1.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nFor historical information specifically pertaining to fireballs, see Fireball \u00a7 History.\n\nIssues relating to \"Ghast\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nIn English, \" ghast \" is an archaic word meaning \"ghastly\".\n\n[13] H.P.\n\nLovecraft first coined its use as the name for a monster (a vaguely humanoid one, in The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath), but \"ghasts\" have appeared in many other fantasy stories and games.\n\nThe player can go inside of a ghast by falling through the top of it or flying (or jumping while attacking) up underneath it.\n\nIf the player stands on top of the head, the player sees inside of it.\n\nIf a ghast is trapped in a 1-thick cube, it shoots fireballs through the cube.\n\nThis is because all mobs that shoot spawn the projectile one block in front of it to prevent the projectile from hitting the mob.\n\nOn rare occasions, ghasts spawn in such a way as to see through blocks (usually trapped on all sides in a tight area).\n\nWhen this happens and the ghast has a \"line of sight\" through those blocks, it launches a fireball in the player's direction.\n\nThis is reminiscent of a blaze but with explosive addition.\n\nC418 revealed in an AMA on Reddit that ghast sounds are taken from his pet cat, who makes them when disturbed while sleeping.\n\n[14] Two ghasts are featured in the LEGO set \"Minecraft Micro World - The Nether\", along with a Zombified Piglin.\n\nWhen killed with its own fireball, a ghast turns orange rather than red. [Bedrock Edition only ] Splash potions affect ghasts only when hitting their lower half.\n\nDespite not having visible feet, ghasts are still capable of making footstep sounds.\n\n[15] There is an unused ghast sound called \"affectionatescream.ogg\" in the game files.\n\nIt can be heard in the last scene of the Nether Update trailer.\n\nGhasts use different models between the Java Edition and Bedrock Edition, and some of their tentacles are different lengths.\n\nThey are one of the only mobs that the Zoglin does not attack.\n\nA ghast up close, shooting a fireball (with the old snowball texture) at the player.\n\nA ghast opens its red eyes when it spits out fireballs (note old \"expansion\" effect).\n\nAnother image of a shooting ghast (with the current textures).\n\nGhasts (note old snowball texture).\n\nA ghast that is in a nether fortress.\n\nA preview of three ghasts in the soul sand valley.\n\nA spawner programmed to spawn ghasts.\n\nPrior to 1.3, ghasts would slightly expand when shooting a fireball.\n\nA ghast flying through falling lava.\n\nA ghast in Pocket Edition.\n\nA ghast close to Sunny, showing how large they are compared to players.\n\nThe Secret Ghast, featured in the Trails & Tales Event.\n\nA Ghast in promotional artwork for the Nether Update.\n\nOfficial Ghast artwork.\n\nA Ghast, as it appears in Minecraft Story Mode.\n\nThe Giant Ghast, a unique variation featured in Minecraft Story Mode.\n\nA baby Ghast, as it appears in Minecraft Dungeons.\n\nGhast Spirit from Super Smash Bros.\n\nUltimate.\n\nGhast micromobs from LEGO Minecraft.\n\nLEGO Minecraft Ghast minifigure.\n\nOfficial T-shirt artwork \"Ghastbusters\" made by JINX.\n\nOfficial T-shirt artwork \"Glimpse\" made by JINX.\n\nOfficial T-shirt artwork \"Postcard\" made by JINX.\n\nOfficial T-shirt artwork \"Rumor Has It\" made by JINX.\n\nA glow in the dark Ghast T-Shirt.\n\nAn officially licensed Ghast hoodie.\n\nGhast plush made by JINX.\n\nAn official Ghast action figure.\n\n\"Never Trick or Treat in the Nether,\" an official tote bag sold for Halloween.\n\nA Ghast pictured in the Mobestiary.\n\nAn officially licensed Nerf Ghast gun.\n\n\u2191 a b MC-49640 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 MC-190140 \u2014 resolved as \"Invalid\".\n\n\u2191 MC-238622 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 MC-200929 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 MC-238623 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 MC-200937 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 MC-162557 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 MC-248332 \u2191 \"No it doesn't\" \u2013 @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X, April 1, 2011 \u2191 Minecraft Halloween Update hands-on; PC Gamer - October 29, 2010 \u2191 Hands-On With the Minecraft Halloween Update; Indie Games Plus - October 29, 2010 \u2191 Minecraft Halloween Update - Slipgate Adventures 2.avi; PC Gamer - October 29, 2010 \u2191 https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ghast \u2191 http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/nbe2h/i_am_the_composer_and_sound_designer_of_minecraft/c37sjyb \u2191 MC-92623 Meet the Ghast \u2013 Minecraft.net on May 22, 2017 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

breedable hostile mob found in the Nether, and a source of porkchops and leather.\n\nA hoglin attacks by thrusting its tusks upward, which can also launch its target a short distance into the air.\n\nHoglins are repelled by warped fungi that is placed in the world as well as active nether portals and respawn anchors.\n\nBaby hoglins behave similarly, but have a much weaker attack (the weakest attack in the game) with normal knockback, and flee when hit.\n\nHoglins are found in herds of 3\u20134 in crimson forests, respawning over time.\n\nThey can spawn at any light level and on most solid blocks other than nether wart blocks and shroomlights.\n\nHoglins spawn in certain types of bastion remnants upon structure generation.\n\nThey spawn frequently in the hoglin stable variant (specifically the large and small stables in the \"lower\" area, but never in the \"upper\" area with ramparts), and sometimes in the main \"bridge entrance\" at the upper half of the rampart in the bridge variant.\n\nSimilarly to the piglins and piglin brutes there, these hoglins never despawn.\n\n20% of hoglins spawn as babies.\n\nHoglins spawn in Peaceful difficulty, but are passive to players.\n\nAdult hoglins drop when killed: 2\u20134 raw porkchop (cooked porkchop while on fire).\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 7 with Looting III.\n\n0\u20131 leather.\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 4 with Looting III.\n\n5 [JE only ] or 1\u20133 [BE only ] if killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nBaby hoglins drop only experience when killed, at the same rate as adult hoglins.\n\nThey are also the only mobs that both grow up and also drop experience.\n\nHoglins avoid warped fungi (including in a flower pot), nether portals and respawn anchors, and will run away from them when within 7 blocks of them.\n\nThey naturally sink in water and eventually drown.\n\n[1] They also sink in lava and are vulnerable to fire damage.\n\n[2] Hoglins can be led with a lead despite the fact they are hostile.\n\nHoglins attack any player within 16 blocks with a reach of 1.9 blocks.\n\nAn adult knocks its target upward.\n\nPlayers can still be flung even if they block with a shield.\n\nHoglins do not attack a player standing near a block that repels them, but run away from the block unless they have already chosen to attack.\n\nHoglins are 60% resistant to knockback.\n\nUnlike other hostile mobs, they do not prevent a player from sleeping.\n\nSimilarly to piglins and zombified piglins, a player or mob attacking a hoglin provokes all nearby hoglins.\n\nAttacking a baby hoglin does not trigger this behavior.\n\nIf a piglin attacks a hoglin, all the hoglins in the area retaliate.\n\nHoglins also flee if outnumbered and make retreating sounds.\n\nIf the piglins are outnumbered by hoglins, they flee and make retreating sounds.\n\nHoglins that spawn upon generation of bastion remnants are not hunted by piglins.\n\nBaby hoglins also attack the player, dealing much less damage and normal knockback.\n\nIf the player attacks a baby hoglin, it temporarily flees.\n\nBaby piglins run near and ride baby hoglins.\n\nIf there are more baby piglins than baby hoglins, the baby piglins occasionally jump on other baby piglins already riding a baby hoglin, with a maximum of 3 stacked on a single baby hoglin.\n\nA hoglin turning into a zoglin.\n\nNotice the hair is flattened down.\n\nIf a hoglin spawns in or moves to the Overworld or the End, it shakes and then transforms into a zoglin after 15 seconds.\n\nThe newly-created zoglin gets Nausea I for 10 seconds.\n\nThis Nausea effect is only decorative and has no effect on the zoglin's behavior.\n\nIn Java Edition, any lead attached to the hoglin breaks when it converts, even though zoglins can have leads attached to them.\n\n[3] Main article: Breeding Other than the killer bunny  [Java Edition only ], the hoglin is the only hostile mob that can be bred.\n\nHoglins can be bred using crimson fungi.\n\nIt takes 5 minutes before the parents can be bred again, and it takes 20 minutes for baby hoglins to mature.\n\nBaby hoglins stay near their parents unless they see a player or get attacked, in which case they attack or run away.\n\nFeeding a crimson fungus to a baby hoglin reduces the remaining time for it to mature by 10%.\n\nHoglins cannot be bred when they are running away from warped fungi, respawn anchors or nether portals.\n\nFeeding crimson fungi to a hoglin prevents it from despawning, regardless of whether the breeding is successful or not.\n\nThe baby hoglin produced by breeding does not despawn either.\n\nJava Edition: Hoglins use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 Except idle1, which is 0.65, and idle4, which is 0.7 \u2191 a b c MC-98316 \u2014 Wrong subtitles caused by missing distinction \u2191 Except for retreat1 (the

300.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Hoglin\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe reason Hoglins run away from warped fungi is because they dislike their smell.\n\n[7] Similarly, when asked if nether portals smell bad to Hoglins, Henrik responded saying that the reason Hoglins run away from Nether Portals is because they find the sound annoying.\n\n[8] Similar to the ravager originally being called \" illager beast\" before its official name was chosen by the community, the Hoglin's name was also chosen by the community.\n\nIts initial placeholder name was \"piglin beast\".\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, there are unused texture files named hoglin_meat_raw and hoglin_meat_cooked that are textured identically to raw and cooked beef, respectively.\n\nHenrik Kniberg released a video [9] of a group of hoglins killing a piglin, then \"celebrating\" by bobbing their heads, then getting on their hind legs and

must be clear of solid or liquid obstructions.\n\nWhen a magma cube attempts to spawn, the game checks for the space requirement of a large magma cube, and the size is determined later.\n\nTherefore, since large magma cubes are slightly taller than 2 blocks, no magma cubes, regardless of size, are able to spawn at all in 2-block-high areas.\n\nAlso, since large magma cubes are slightly wider than 2 blocks, and mobs spawn at the center of a block, having any block within the 3\u00d72.1x3 area, even as thin as a glass pane, can prevent a magma cube of any size from spawning.\n\nMagma cubes' size is affected by regional difficulty: chances range from 33% for each size at the low difficulty to 16% small, 33% medium, and 50% big with higher difficulty.\n\nMagma cubes spawn uncommonly in nether wastes in groups of 1 to 4.\n\nMagma cubes spawn commonly in nether fortresses in groups of 4.\n\nMagma cubes spawn commonly in basalt deltas, in groups of 2 to 5.\n\nMagma cube monster spawners generate in the treasure room of bastions.\n\nLarge magma cube: 0\u20131 magma cream (0.25 average) and 4 experience Medium magma cube: 0\u20131 magma cream (0.25 average) and 2 experience Small magma cube: 1 experience (or 1 froglight if killed by a frog).\n\nThe maximum of magma cream can be increased by 1 per level of Looting.\n\nLooting 1 averages 0.5 per kill, Looting 2 averages ~0.81 per kill, and Looting 3 averages ~1.21 per kill.\n\nUnlike a lot of common loot which picks a random number between 0 and 1 for its drop, the magma cube's drop ranges between -2 and 1 instead.\n\nThis leads to the 25% drop chance from an unenchanted kill, as well as the relatively low averages with the Looting enchantment since a negative base roll can cancel out the bonus roll made by Looting.\n\nMagma cube jumping.\n\nA magma cube seeks out any player or an iron golem within a spherical distance of 16 blocks.\n\nIf it finds no enemy, it changes direction every 40 to 100 ticks (2 to 5 seconds) and jumps forward every 40 to 120 ticks (2 to 6 seconds).\n\nIf it finds a target, the delay before jumping is 1 \u2044 3 as long (13 to 40 ticks), and the magma cube changes direction directly toward the target before jumping.\n\nMagma cubes cannot be hurt by fall damage or burning, and are not slowed down by lava.\n\nThey can swim upward in lava and leap above its surface.\n\nTheir jump height depends on their size.\n\nTheir forward speed is twice that of most other mobs.\n\nThey always make a distinct sound upon jumping up and landing, but no idle sounds.\n\nWhen a magma cube is killed, it splits into 2-4 smaller magma cubes.\n\nTiny magma cubes disappear when killed, like other mobs.\n\nThey can swim in water and attempt to stay on the surface.\n\nLike slimes, magma cubes starts taking drowning damage if submerged in water for 15 seconds, splitting into smaller cubes if possible.\n\nMagma cubes take extra damage from powder snow, taking 5 every two seconds, unlike 1 for other mobs.\n\nUnlike most mobs, magma cubes have no pathfinding ability, meaning that they do not avoid falling off cliffs and cannot go around walls, even when chasing a player.\n\nThis behavior is shared by slimes.\n\nWhen they are in lava, they hover and try to move to nearby land.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Combat \u00a7 Magma Cubes Magma cubes attack by jumping and attempting to land on the player, and cause damage when touched anywhere.\n\nAs their jump rate is random, magma cubes can be hard to fight.\n\nThe health of a magma cube is its size squared; the attack strength is its size + 2, and the armor points are its size tripled.\n\nA magma cube jumps a distance of approximately its length times 1.5 and a height equivalent to its size in blocks.\n\nThis means that a large magma cube jumps 4 blocks in height and moves significantly quicker than a small magma cube, which jumps 2 blocks in height; while a tiny magma cube moves slowly and jumps 1 block in height.\n\nMagma cubes continuously damage all players and iron golems [JE only ] they collide with (although damage immunity reduces the actual damage to 2 attacks per second), unlike other mobs that damage only those targets they specifically attack.\n\n[1] This means that a large magma cube deals 12 \u00d7 6 of damage per second on normal difficulty.\n\nUnlike slimes, tiny magma cubes can deal damage to the player.\n\nJava Edition: Magma cubes use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b c MC-98316 \u2014 Wrong subtitles

A piglin is a neutral mob found in the Nether.\n\nIt is hostile to players unless they wear at least one piece of golden armor.\n\nIt can be given gold ingots to barter for various items.\n\nIt wields either a golden sword or a crossbow, and uses either melee or ranged attacks, respectively.\n\nBaby piglins do not grow up, never hold weapons or attack, and take gold without giving anything in return.\n\nPiglins spawn in groups of 2-4 in nether wastes and crimson forest biomes, and within bastion remnants upon generation, at a light level of 11 or less in Java Edition, or 7 or less in Bedrock Edition on most blocks other than nether wart blocks or magma blocks.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, they can naturally spawn even in Peaceful difficulty.\n\nEach piglin has a 20% [Java Edition only ] or 5% [Bedrock Edition only ] chance of spawning as a baby.\n\nPiglins have a 50% chance of spawning with either a sword or a crossbow.\n\nThey also have a 10% chance per armor slot of spawning with golden armor, meaning they have a 34.39% chance of spawning with any armor and a 0.01% chance of spawning with a full set.\n\nPiglins spawn in Peaceful difficulty, but are passive to players.\n\nAdults have an 8.5% chance of dropping the held item (a golden sword or crossbow with random durability).\n\nEach Looting level increases this chance by 1%.\n\nBabies spawn without equipment.\n\nIn Java Edition, a picked-up item always drops with the same durability as when picked up.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, armor picked up by piglins can lose durability and even break depending on how much damage the piglin takes.\n\nPiglins do not drop gold ingots, raw porkchops, or cooked porkchops that they have picked up.\n\nIn both versions, a piglin also drops a piglin head when killed in the vicinity of the explosion of a charged creeper.\n\nIf a piglin is killed in one hit while admiring a gold ingot, the gold ingot is dropped upon the piglin's death.\n\nAdults sometimes spawn with 1-4 pieces of armor, which can be: Golden Helmet Golden Chestplate Golden Leggings Golden Boots These have a chance of being enchanted.\n\nThese are dropped with an 8.5% chance and random durability.\n\nIn addition to their drops, piglins can also pick up other types of armor, including wearable items from the player.\n\nAdults drop 5 and an additional 1\u20133 per armor piece if killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nBaby piglins only drop 1.\n\nPiglins snort enviously while watching players holding a gold-related item or anything else.\n\nLike villagers, piglins can open and close wooden doors but cannot open fence gates, all trapdoors, and iron doors.\n\nPiglins cannot swim and can drown if submerged.\n\n[1] Unlike zombified variant, they are not naturally immune to fire or lava.\n\n[2] Idle piglins are afraid of zombified piglins, zoglins, soul fire, soul torches, soul lanterns, and lit soul campfires.\n\nIf a piglin comes within a certain distance of any of these things, it will squeal in fear and run away until the object or mob is out of its sight range.\n\nHostile piglins lose their fear of soul fire items, but they will still flee from zombified piglins and zoglins and will not approach the player if they are near either of these mobs.\n\nBaby piglins additionally retreat from wither skeletons and withers, but adult piglins will attack these on sight.\n\nCrossbow piglins do not reload their crossbows when spawned, unlike pillagers.\n\nThey reload only when provoked.\n\nBaby piglins are passive and play with baby hoglins, running around and riding upon them.\n\nUp to 3 baby piglins may stack on top of each other while riding a baby hoglin.\n\nThey can be given gold, but they do not give anything in return and run away.\n\nThey can also pick up and wear armor as well as hold gold tools or weapons.\n\nHowever, they are unable to pick up leather.\n\nIn addition, baby piglins never grow up.\n\n[3] If the player attacks a piglin, this action will not aggravate zombified piglins in the area.\n\nInfighting between these two mobs can start when an aggravated piglin carrying a crossbow shoots a zombified piglin by accident.\n\nWhen this happens, all nearby zombified piglins will become angry and pursue the piglin until it is either killed or runs out of their sight range.\n\nAdult piglins are neutral if the player is wearing at least one piece of golden armor.\n\nPiglins are provoked by any player who: Is not wearing any piece of gold armor.\n\nPiglins have short ranged detection for this.\n\nResults in light aggravation.\n\nAttacks the piglin.\n\nPiglins have long ranged detection for this.\n\nResults in heavy aggravation.\n\nAttacks another piglin or piglin brute, regardless of whether the player kills it in one hit or not.\n\nPiglins have long ranged detection for this.\n\nResults in medium aggravation.\n\nOpens a chest, trapped chest, ender chest, [4] shulker box, [5] barrel, minecart with chest, or boat with chest.\n\nPiglins have short ranged detection for this.\n\nResults in medium aggravation.\n\nBreaks a block of gold, gold ore, gilded blackstone, nether gold ore, block of raw gold, deepslate gold ore, or any of the blocks listed above.\n\nPiglins have medium ranged detection for this.\n\nResults in medium aggravation.\n\nIllustration of short range aggravation of piglins.\n\nNote the spherical range, and that piglins behind walls are not aggravated due to the line of sight being blocked.\n\nShort range: When a piglin has been aggravated by a player not wearing gold armor, or opening a container, piglins from up to around 15 blocks centered around the player become aggravated by the player if there is a straight line of sight to the player.\n\nMedium range: When a piglin has been aggravated by a player breaking a golden block or a container, piglins from up to 16 blocks from the player\u2019s feet become aggravated.\n\nNo line of sight is required.\n\nLong range: When a piglin has been aggravated by a player damaging a piglin or piglin brute, piglins from up to 16 blocks from the damaged piglin (rather than the player) become aggravated.\n\nNo line of sight is required.\n\nLight aggravation occurs when a piglin has been aggravated by a player not wearing gold armor.\n\nThe piglin can de-aggravate when the player puts on gold armor, distracts the piglin with gold, or the piglin loses a line of sight with the player.\n\nMedium aggravation occurs when a piglin has been aggravated by a player opening/breaking a container or breaking a golden block, or when a piglin witnesses a piglin brute or another piglin getting damaged by a player.\n\nPiglins under medium aggravation can be distracted with gold.\n\nA piglin already under light aggravation does not re-aggravate to medium aggravation.\n\nThis means that if a piglin knows a player broke a golden block near them after already going after them due to them not wearing gold armor, the player can de-aggravate that piglin by putting on gold armor or losing the line of sight despite the fact that the player broke the golden block.\n\nHeavy aggravation occurs if a piglin is damaged.\n\nThe damaged piglin cannot be distracted by gold and is unable to barter while under heavy aggravation.\n\nIf the player is under the influence of the Invisibility effect, they can open containers in front of piglins without aggravating them (short range), although breaking containers or golden blocks still angers them (mid/long range).\n\nPiglins do not react to the opening or breaking of furnace s, blast furnace s, smoker s, dropper s, dispenser s, or brewing stand s.\n\nOpening or breaking a hopper does not provoke the piglins.\n\n[6] Breaking a bell does not provoke them either, despite piglins admiring them as gold.\n\n[7] When a piglin is attacking, it holds its dominant arm and sword in front of it, similarly to a vindicator.\n\nAdult piglins are hostile toward wither skeletons and withers.\n\nThey congregate within 16 blocks and attack in hordes.\n\nWhen attacking with a crossbow, piglins shoot arrows every 2 seconds.\n\nIn Java Edition, they walk backward (stopping if at the edge of a drop) as soon as the target is close.\n\nIn Java Edition, their crossbows can break if it runs out of durability, [8] making the piglins use their fists, while in Bedrock Edition their crossbows never break.\n\n[9] Unlike mobs armed with bows, they do not strafe from left to right while shooting.\n\nPiglins with swords and other items rush at the target.\n\nIf a group of piglins successfully defeat their target, they gather at the site of their target's demise and emit \"celebration sounds\".\n\nHowever, piglins do not have a chance of dancing unless their target was a hoglin.\n\nWhen a mob attacks a piglin or piglin brute with no AI, other piglins nearby do not attack the mob that attacked the piglin or piglin brute with no AI.\n\nIron golems attack both adult and baby piglins; however, piglins do not attack iron golems without provocation.\n\nThe detection range of piglins is reduced to half of their normal range (17.5 blocks) when the player is wearing a piglin head.\n\nPiglin celebrating dance.\n\nPiglins sometimes attack hoglins, causing other piglins and piglin brutes [Bedrock Edition only ] in that area to attack the targeted hoglin as well.\n\nAdults do not immediately attack adult hoglins on sight, but a piglin has a random chance to make the decision to hunt a hoglin (this decision is almost never made if the piglin recently hunted, but other piglins can still start a hunt).\n\n[verify ] Once that piglin attacks the hoglin, all other piglins and piglin brutes [Bedrock Edition only ] in that area become hostile to the hoglin.\n\nIf outnumbered by hoglins, the piglins flee, making \"retreat\" sounds.\n\nAfter defeating a hoglin, piglins have a 10% chance to do a \"victory dance\" by bobbing their heads and sticking out their arms like a T-pose.\n\nThe more piglins there are, the bigger chance of a hunt might happen (because more piglins that detect the hoglin will each have a 10% chance of starting a hunt).\n\nAfter a hunt, any nearby piglins pick up the porkchops or cooked porkchops the hoglin dropped, but not the leather.\n\nPiglin brutes never pick up any porkchops or leather.\n\nPiglins that spawned as part of a bastion remnant during world generation do not hunt.\n\nPiglin brutes also join in hunts started by piglins, but do not start a hunt themselves. [Bedrock Edition only ] Piglins briefly stop attacking when given gold items.\n\nIf the player offers a gold ingot, bartering then takes place as it normally would.\n\nThey resume attacking once the barter is complete.\n\nIf the player distracts them with a gold item and equips a piece of gold armor while the piglin is examining the item, then the piglin ceases hostility.\n\nThey may also cease hostility if distracted enough times.\n\nIf the player breaks any gold-related block or hurts/kills a piglin, and then distracts the piglin up to 5 times with a piece of gold armor equipped, the piglin ceases hostility entirely.\n\nMain article: Bartering Adult piglins can trade gold ingots for certain items, when a gold ingot is dropped near them or the player uses it while looking at them.\n\nThe piglin proceeds to \"examine\" the ingot for six [JE only ] or eight [BE only ] [10] seconds, then drops a random item from the chart.\n\nHowever, baby piglins examine the ingot but instead run away without dropping an item.\n\nPiglins can also pick up items dropped by a dispenser or dropper.\n\nThe pool for what piglins can barter may be modified in a data pack  [JE only ].\n\nHowever, piglins can still barter while riding another mob.\n\nPiglins can pick up and equip any items they come across, preferring gold -related items, which they actively seek out.\n\nA piglin inspects any gold-related item before equipping, holding or putting that item in its inventory for six seconds after picking it up.\n\nHowever, items not related to gold are held or equipped (if the piglin does not have any gold equipment) instantly.\n\nPiglins do not pick up any items if the / gamerule mobGriefing is set to false.\n\nPiglins pick up raw porkchops and cooked porkchops that are within 1 block from them, unless they have done so within the last 10 seconds.\n\nPiglins have eight hidden inventory slots in which they can stack items.\n\nPiglins with full inventories do not attempt to pick up gold-related items, except gold ingots.\n\nBaby piglins attempt to pick up any item and do not give the player any items in exchange for gold ingots.\n\nAdult piglins can pick up gold nuggets (which do not help to obtain better items from bartering but are immediately placed in their inventory), porkchops, and cooked porkchops (they do not actively seek out and contemplate porkchops).\n\nPiglins drop any of these items upon death aside from gold ingots, raw porkchops, and cooked porkchops.\n\nWhen a piglin is admiring a gold ingot while bartering, it does not run away from nearby zoglins or nearby zombified piglins.\n\nPiglins with crossbows can pick up other crossbows and equip them.\n\nLike other mobs capable of picking up items, piglins pick up armor and weapons.\n\nPiglins pick up armor that is better than the armor they are already wearing, although they prefer gold over stronger armor.\n\nFor example, a piglin does not pick up leather boots if it is already wearing diamond boots, but may discard a netherite chestplate to pick up a golden chestplate.\n\nHowever, they cannot unequip and discard armor with Curse of Binding.\n\nPiglins that spawned in a bastion remnant during world generation, or that have picked up items or equipment, do not despawn naturally.\n\nItems picked up by a piglin do not drop when the piglin is killed.\n\nItems that piglins want are listed under the piglin_loved tag with the exception of gold nuggets, which piglins pick up instantly to trigger the advancement / achievement \"O(oo)h Shiny!\".\n\nPiglins do not want any other items, even if they are related to gold in some way.\n\nBell Block of gold Block of raw gold Clock Deepslate gold ore Enchanted golden apple Gilded blackstone Glistering melon slice Gold ingot (piglins barter something else in return) Gold nugget Gold ore Golden apple Golden axe Golden boots (worn after being examined) Golden carrot Golden chestplate (worn after being examined) Golden helmet (worn after being examined) Golden hoe Golden horse armor Golden leggings (worn after being examined) Golden pickaxe Golden shovel Golden sword (equipped if piglin is using a non-gold weapon or crossbow, or does not already have one) Light weighted pressure plate Nether gold ore Powered rail  [Bedrock Edition only ] [11] Raw gold A piglin turning into a zombified piglin.\n\nWhen in the Overworld and the End, piglins transform into zombified piglins after 15 seconds, retaining their armor, held items and their name.\n\nHowever, they cannot shoot a crossbow, using it as a melee weapon instead.\n\nUpon transformation, the spawned zombified piglin has the Nausea effect for 10 seconds; this is just a cosmetic effect.\n\nWhen a piglin transforms into a zombified piglin, it drops anything except equipped weapons and armor in its inventory; other items in its inventory disappear.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, if the game is set to Peaceful difficulty, the piglin despawns instead of transforming because hostile mobs do not exist in Peaceful difficulty.\n\nA piglin that returns to the Nether before 15 seconds remains unchanged, although the 15-second portal cooldown usually prevents them from returning during that time.\n\nA piglin does not zombify outside the Nether if its IsImmuneToZombification tag is set to true.\n\nPiglins with their NoAI tag set to true also do not zombify.\n\nIn Java Edition, if a piglin is inspecting/admiring a gold ingot or a gold-related item and then gets zombified while inspecting, it drops the gold ingot or the gold-related item.\n\nJava Edition: Piglins use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b c MC-98316 \u2014 Wrong subtitles caused by missing distinction \u2191 idle1 and idle2 are 0.7;

In Bedrock Edition:' Height: 1.9 blocks.\n\nWidth: 0.6 blocks Skeletons are undead common hostile mobs that perform ranged attacks with a bow by shooting arrows.\n\nA skeleton may spawn above a solid block at a light level of zero in the Overworld except in mushroom fields and deep dark biomes, usually in small groups of up to four skeletons in Java Edition or two skeletons in Bedrock Edition.\n\n80% of skeletons spawned directly under the sky in snowy plains, ice spikes, frozen oceans, deep frozen oceans and legacy frozen oceans biomes spawn as stray mobs.\n\nSpiders have a very low chance of 1% to spawn with a skeleton riding them, creating a spider jockey.\n\nFour skeleton horsemen spawn when a skeleton horse trap is triggered, typically during a thunderstorm.\n\nThe skeletons ride on skeleton horses and are equipped with enchanted bows and iron helmets and, in Java Edition, have damage immunity for 3 seconds after spawning.\n\nSkeletons spawn from 25% of the monster spawners found in monster rooms.\n\nSkeletons spawn commonly in soul sand valleys, biomes of the Nether.\n\nHowever, existing skeletons lower the spawning chances of other hostile mobs nearby, meaning there are much less skeletons in a given area compared to zombified piglins in nether wastes.\n\nIn nether fortresses structures, there is a 20% chance that a skeleton spawns in place of a wither skeleton.\n\nA skeleton drops upon death: From zero to two bone s.\n\nThe maximum drop is increased by one per level of Looting, for a maximum of zero to five bones with Looting at the level three.\n\nFrom zero to two arrow s.\n\nThe maximum drop is increased by one per level of Looting, for a maximum of zero to five arrows with Looting at the level three.\n\nAny naturally spawned equipment, naturally its damaged and sometimes enchanted bow, has an 8.5% chance of dropping if killed by the player or a tamed wolf (9.5% with Looting one, 10.5% with Looting two and 11.5% with Looting three).\n\nPicked-up items always drop and drop with the same damage level it had when picked up.\n\nA skeleton skull if killed by a charged creeper 's explosion.\n\n5 experience orbs when killed by a player or a tamed wolf, and an extra 1\u20133 experience orbs for each piece of natural equipment that does not drop upon death.\n\nBecause all skeletons spawn with at least a bow, this leaves an unarmored skeleton dropping 6\u20138 experience orbs if it doesn't drop its bow upon death.\n\nIf the skeleton does drop its bow, it drops the default 5 experience orbs instead.\n\nSkeletons chase players, baby turtles and iron golems they see within 16 blocks, climbing stairs or ladders, navigating mazes and traversing other complex obstacles to get within their shooting range.\n\nA skeleton shooting.\n\nWhen within 15 blocks of a target and with a clear line of sight, the skeleton starts shooting with arrows, once every two seconds on easy and normal difficulties or once every second on hard difficulty.\n\nIf the player leaves the 15-block radius, skeletons wait for some seconds with the bow charged, shooting the moment the player comes within range again.\n\nTheir detection range is reduced by 50% if a skeleton skull is worn by the player.\n\nThis stacks with sneaking and the Invisibility effect.\n\nThe skeleton's accuracy is based on the world difficulty.\n\nSkeletons have an \"error\" of 10 on Easy, 6 on Normal and 2 on Hard.\n\nThis is compared to the player's lack of accuracy of 1.\n\nTo account for gravity, skeletons aim 0.2 blocks higher for every horizontal block of range to the target.\n\nSkeletons have infinite durability on their bows, and can shoot an infinite amount of arrows.\n\nArrows shot by skeletons cannot be picked up from the ground.\n\nSkeleton behavior varies between the game editions: Java Edition Strafe in circular patterns to dodge attacks and retreat to a safe range if the player comes within 4 blocks.\n\nThey sometimes walk off cliffs while strafing.\n\n[1] Sprint toward the player if they are 14 blocks away or farther.\n\nUse bows even underwater.\n\nThe water slows down the arrows.\n\nAnimates its bow while attacking.\n\nBedrock Edition Skeletons typically stop moving to shoot, making no attempt to avoid being hit.\n\nAn underwater skeleton uses a melee attack because it is unable to use a bow underwater.\n\nA skeleton on land shoots quickly at a player in water.\n\nThe rate of fire increases as the player approaches, making combat difficult due to the knockback.\n\nIn most cases, if a skeleton's arrow hits a neutral or hostile mob that has not yet been attacked by the player, the mob attacks the skeleton.\n\nWhen a skeleton is attacked by another mob (including another skeleton), it attacks that mob, reorienting on the player once the mob is dead.\n\nSkeletons flee from wolves.\n\nA skeleton runs from a chasing wolf until the wolf deals damage, after which the skeleton turns to shoot at the wolf that successfully attacked it.\n\nDueling skeletons.\n\nOne skeleton turned red from being shot by the other skeleton.\n\nSkeletons sink in water and cannot swim, but do not drown.\n\nIf a skeleton is inside of powder snow for 7 seconds, it converts into a stray.\n\nA newly-converted stray always has full health even if converted from a damaged skeleton.\n\nThe converted stray keeps any items worn or held when it was a skeleton.\n\nOnly skeletons can become strays; wither skeletons cannot be converted.\n\nWolves attacking a skeleton.\n\nIf spawned with a weapon other than a bow, or no weapon at all (which can be spawned with commands such as / summon skeleton ~ ~ ~ {HandItems:[{Count:1,id:\"iron_sword\"}]}, or / summon skeleton ~ ~ ~ {}), a skeleton charges at a player with arms outstretched and deals damage by touch, similar to a wither skeleton.\n\nA skeleton holding a tipped arrow in its off-hand always shoots that type of arrow, and the arrow held is not consumed.\n\nIf a creeper dies from a skeleton's arrow, it drops one of any music discs except for Pigstep, Otherside, 5, and Relic.\n\nA skeleton burning in sunlight.\n\nSkeletons burn at dawn when the sun is 15 degrees or greater above the ground and when the moon can no longer be seen, unless the skeleton is: Below an opaque block.\n\nIn a sunlight level of 11 or less.\n\nIn water.\n\nStanding in soul sand.\n\nAffected by Fire Resistance.\n\nWearing a helmet, which absorbs the damage, wearing out completely after a long time, usually several day cycles.\n\nStanding in cobwebs.\n\n[2] If not wearing a helmet, it seeks out shade during the day or enters water to protect itself.\n\nUnlike zombies, which leave the shade to chase a player, skeletons do not exit the shaded area even while attacking.\n\nSkeletons are undead mobs, causing them to be damaged by the Instant Health status effect, healed by the Instant Damage status effect, and unaffected by the status effects Regeneration and Poison.\n\nSkeletons are ignored by the wither and are affected by the Smite enchantment.\n\nSome spawned skeletons have the ability to pick up dropped items from the ground.\n\nUnlike zombies, however, they pick up only weapons or armor.\n\nIf a picked up item is armor, a carved pumpkin or a mob head, a skeleton equips itself with the item.\n\nIf the picked up item is a weapon, the skeleton uses the item as a melee weapon.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, skeletons can also pick up and equip illager banners worn in their chest slot.\n\nSkeletons spawn already-armed with bows, which may be enchanted.\n\nThe chances of that event are listed below from code.\n\nIf a skeleton spawns wearing multiple pieces of armor, the armor is never mismatched (all pieces are made of the same material) except if it is spawned as part of a skeleton trap, in which case only the iron helmet may not match the rest of the armor.\n\n\u2191 a b c d e f g h i Value is based on the regional difficulty.\n\n\u2191 100% chance of a bow \u2191 a b Enchantment is the same as on an enchantment table at level 5\u201322.\n\n[note 1] If a skeleton does spawn with armor, the chances of specific armor are as follows: In Java Edition, the armor pieces go from feet to head, and in Bedrock Edition, they go from head to feet.\n\nThe chances of it being of a particular material are: The armor is not damaged from most damage sources; it cannot \"wear out\" the way player armor does.\n\nHelmets (not blocks like carved pumpkins) on skeletons can break if the skeleton is exposed to daylight or has an anvil or other falling block dropped on its hitbox.\n\nIf a skeleton has a bow and a sword is given, it drops the bow, with the same chance as if killed with Looting I and starts using the sword.\n\nIf a skeleton has a sword or bow in its hand, and one of a better type or with better enchantments is given, the skeleton drops the existing weapon, with the same chance as if killed with Looting I in favor of the better one.\n\nAny skeleton that spawns with equipment (picked-up items do not count) gives 1\u20133 extra experience points per item.\n\nIf multiple viable items exist, the skeleton endlessly picks up and drops the items.\n\n[3] On Halloween, skeletons may spawn wearing a carved pumpkin or jack o'lantern.\n\nThey do not drop this, even when killed with Looting.\n\nJava Edition: Skeletons use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: \u2191 MCPE-53297 Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Skeletons have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs StrayConversionTime: The number of ticks until this skeleton converts to a stray (default value is -1, when no conversion is under way).\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nHistorical sounds: Issues relating to \"Skeleton\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nIf alerted to a player 's presence, a skeleton can fire arrows backward, occasionally hitting themselves.\n\nSkeletons cannot see the player through glass, fences, or other transparent blocks.\n\nSkeletons and their variants do not know how to use a crossbow, despite the same using method as a bow.\n\nThe artificial intelligence of skeletons in Bedrock Edition is a mix of skeleton AI from Java Edition between versions 1.5 and 1.8.9 and the skeletons in Update Aquatic.\n\nThey shoot faster when they are on land and the target underwater, causing knockback enough to make combat hard.\n\nAdditionally, they do not strafe left to right, and they shoot more rapidly at closer targets.\n\nSkeletons also use ranged attacks on land and switch to melee attacks when sinking underwater.\n\nIn Java Edition, 89% of skeletons hold their bow in their right hand and 11% with the left.\n\nThis reflects estimated handedness percentages in the real world.\n\nIf a skeleton has a sword or any other melee item, generally with commands, its AI resembles the wither skeleton 's AI.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, skeletons do not animate their bow.\n\nC418 used bamboo wind chime sounds as a base for the skeleton sounds.\n\n[5] This page would benefit from the addition of

    "content": "This article is about the mob.\n\nFor the enchantment, see Depth Strider.\n\nFor playable DLC character in Minecraft Dungeons with a similar appearance, see:MCD:Strider Warrior.\n\nStrider Strider Shiver Saddled Health 20 \u00d7 10 Classification Animal Behavior Passive Spawn Lava sea Delta Nether Wastes Crimson Forest Warped Forest Soul Sand Valley Basalt Deltas Usable items Warped Fungus Saddle Lead Warped Fungus on a Stick Details Size Adult: Height: 1.7 Blocks Width: 0.9 Blocks Baby: Height: 0.85 Blocks Width: 0.45 Blocks Striders are passive mobs native to the Nether.\n\nThey can walk on lava, and be saddled and ridden by the player.\n\nA warped fungus on a stick is needed to control a strider, similar to how a pig is controlled by a carrot on a stick.\n\nStriders can spawn in every Nether biome.\n\nTwo to four striders spawn on spaces of lava that have an air block above.\n\nIn Java Edition, striders are the only passive mob in the Nether, so spawning attempts are made every 400 game ticks.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, striders share the animal population cap with hoglins and their spawn rate depends on biome, being impacted by the ability of other mobs to spawn at a given coordinate.\n\nFor every strider that spawns, there is a 1 in 10 chance of an additional baby strider to spawn riding on top of the previous strider.\n\nThis behavior is limited to one strider.\n\n[1] A baby strider on the adult strider continues to grow although it does not dismount the adult strider once it has grown up.\n\nZombified piglins have a 1 in 30 chance of spawning on top of a strider.\n\nIf this happens, the strider spawns with a saddle and the zombified piglin spawns carrying a warped fungus on a stick.\n\nThe zombified piglin does not despawn naturally, and does not count towards the mob cap.\n\nOn Peaceful difficulty, the zombified piglin despawns immediately, leaving a saddled strider.\n\n[2] If a strider spawns under lava, it rises out of the lava.\n\nin Bedrock Edition, baby striders spawn more commonly than adult striders do, including when spawned by a spawn egg.\n\nAn adult strider that spawned with a baby strider riding it.\n\nAn adult strider that spawned with a zombified piglin riding it.\n\nAdult purple strider riding an adult red strider Adult striders drop 2\u20135 string upon death.\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 2\u20138 with Looting III. [JE only ] [3] Striders wearing a saddle always drop the saddle upon death, regardless of whether they spawn wearing it or a player put it on them.\n\nThe only way to remove a saddle from a strider is to kill the strider.\n\nWhen an adult strider is killed by a player or tamed wolf, 1\u20132 [JE only ] / 1\u20133 [BE only ] experience is dropped.\n\nLava does not damage striders.\n\nUnlike most mobs, striders can walk on top of lava without sinking.\n\nUpon being harmed by another mob, striders attempt to flee for a few seconds while making \"retreat\" noises.\n\nStriders are damaged by water, rain, and splash water bottles, which deal damage by 1 per splash water bottle or half-second in water or rain, which can kill them.\n\nWhile in water, they slowly sink while taking damage.\n\nStriders still take damage from rain even if they are in lava.\n\nHowever, they are not harmed when standing in a filled cauldron.\n\nThey are not harmed by snowfall or snowballs.\n\nThey take extra damage from freezing in powder snow.\n\nUnlike piglins and hoglins, striders can exist safely in the Overworld, as long as they are kept away from water and rain.\n\nUnlike some other mobs, striders do not zombify when leaving the Nether.\n\nStriders outside of lava change to a dull purple color, change their expression to more of a frown, shiver, and their legs become slightly shorter.\n\nThey also move slower when outside of lava.\n\n[4] If a strider has the Speed effect applied to it, the strider moves faster on both land and lava (though its land speed is still considerably slow).\n\nIf a zombified piglin is riding a strider, the strider pursues the player if the zombified piglin is angered.\n\nDue to a bug, [5] striders that fall from a height take fall damage when landing in lava source blocks.\n\nThis does not occur for striders that fall into flowing lava.\n\nA baby strider on an adult strider still grows into an adult.\n\nApart from this, adult striders riding other adult striders do not spawn naturally.\n\nBaby striders not riding on an adult follow the closest adult strider.\n\nA strider walking.\n\nA strider shivering and slowed down on land.\n\nMain article: Riding A player riding a strider (click to see animation).\n\nThe player can ride on an adult strider using a saddle.\n\nSimilar to how pigs are controlled using a carrot on a stick, striders move forward automatically while their direction is influenced using a warped fungus on a stick, at a speed of 4.14 m/s if on a flat lava surface (such as the Nether lava sea) or 1.74 m/s if on land.\n\nThey walk especially slowly against the lava flow direction.\n\nWarped fungus on a stick can be used, causing the strider to boost and walk at a greater speed [more information needed ] and taking 1 point of durability from the warped fungus on a stick.\n\nThey also follow players holding a warped fungus or a warped fungus on a stick.\n\nUnlike underwater boats, players riding striders into lava (for example, getting into flowing-only from heights or horizons, static lava from horizons) do not dismount if the strider submerges into the lava, and striders slowly rise back up to the surface if this happens.\n\nHowever, players risk getting burned by the lava while submerged.\n\nHowever, in Java Edition, players cannot start riding a strider that is fully submerged within the lava.\n\nWhen ridden over land, striders automatically walk up any one block high slope.\n\nThey also cross any 1-wide block gap or air space that is only one block higher - diagonally up - when ridden directly upward and not completely sideways to the slope.\n\nTo safely dismount from a strider, a player who does not have Fire Resistance may face a solid block within reach before dismounting to dismount onto that block, [6] instead of at the strider's location (which is usually in lava [7]).\n\nStriders can still be equipped with a saddle while another mob is riding it.\n\nMain article: Breeding If striders are given warped fungus, they breed to create baby striders, granting the player 1\u20137 experience orbs.\n\nThe parent striders have a cooldown of about 5 minutes before they can breed again.\n\nAll babies obtained through breeding take 20 minutes to grow up.\n\nThe growth of baby striders can be slowly accelerated using warped fungus; each use takes 10% off of the remaining time to grow up.\n\nJava Edition: Striders use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b MC-184399 Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Striders have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Additional fields for mobs that can breed Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Saddle: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the strider is saddled.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nThis page would benefit from the addition of more images.\n\nPlease remove this notice once you've added suitable images to the article.\n\nThe specific instructions are: Strider jockey in bedrock edition Issues relating to \"Strider\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nStrider's fin Striders had a fin in their texture file.\n\nThe fin wasn't visible in-game and was removed in 20w15a.\n\nIf commands are used to saddle a baby strider, and the player rides the baby strider, the player takes fire damage due to not being high enough to avoid the lava.\n\nMojang added striders to the game as the solution to the community request for lava boats.\n\n[11] At one point in the strider's development, before it was added to the game, a strider out of lava would retract its legs and start to take damage while bouncing around until it died, similar to how fish suffocate when out of water.\n\nThis feature was discarded for being \"too sad\".\n\n[12] Striders were planned to have their own unique armor and saddle, but this was decided against.\n\n[13] Striders were initially going to have a long tongue with which they could eat things, not too dissimilar to a current frogs.\n\nThe different items would all have various effects, such as swords hurting the strider, and TNT exploding.\n\n[14] Part of the reason that striders drop string (from their bristles) was to answer the question of \"how do piglins make crossbows?\".\n\n[12] In Minecraft Legends:Return of the Piglins, striders shed the strings which piglins used to make crossbows.\n\n[15] The bobbing animation that the strider makes while walking was initially an accident.\n\nHowever, the developers thought it was \"quirky and fun\", so it was added as a feature.\n\n[12] Idle A strider walking A strider shivering A saddled strider idling A saddled strider shiver A cold strider shivering A cold strider walking while shivering A saddled cold strider shivering Strider teaser 1 Strider teaser 2 Strider teaser 3 Kingbdogz riding a strider.\n\nA cold strider in a warped forest.\n\nUpside down striders.\n\nAdult and baby striders.\n\nA strider with a jockey.\n\nStriders in love.\n\nDismounting a strider into lava.\n\nRiding a strider over lava.\n\nLots of striders and ghasts.\n\nBaby strider riding on an adult strider.\n\nStriders are occasionally ridden by a zombified piglin when spawned.\n\nStriders can be ridden by baby zombified piglins too.\n\nThree striders riding one another before 20w18a.\n\nStrider out of the lava.\n\nA comparison image of model differences between Java and Bedrock.\n\nPlayer riding a strider riding a strider, with nearby striders looking on.\n\nThree baby striders stacked on top of an adult.\n\nA baby strider riding an adult.\n\nSeveral striders on a lava sea.\n\nStriders can walk on top of other mobs.\n\nPiglin and a shivering strider A player attracting multiple striders using a warped fungus on a stick.\n\nConcept art of an early design of the strider.\n\nAn early design of the strider by Jasper Boerstra, similar in appearance to a tardigrade.\n\nAn early, ghast -like design of the strider.\n\nNotice that there is no hair and one has six legs, while the other has nine.\n\nConcept art of the strider.\n\nNotice the carrot on a stick instead of warped fungus on a stick.\n\nStrider Warrior, a hero dressed as a strider featured in Minecraft Dungeons.\n\nLego Minecraft Strider.\n\nAn official Strider action figure.\n\nA strider as it appears on the cover of Minecraft Legends: Return of the Piglins.\n\n\u2191 MC-176028 \u2014 \"Striders can spawn in stacks of three or more\" \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 MC-232869 \u2014 Adult striders can spawn with saddles in peaceful mode \u2191 MCPE-112761 \u2191 This behavior is controlled by the #strider_warm_blocks block tag.\n\n\u2191 MC-197177 \u2191 \"\u2026dismounting Striders when looking at a nearby solid block will dismount you onto that solid block, making it safer!\" by Brandon Pearce \u2013 Twitter.\n\n\u2191 https://twitter.com/kingbdogz/status/1256262349343936513 \u2191 MC-183764 \u2191 MC-176116 \u2191 MC-176034 \u2191 \"We are introducing the Strider in the Nether update.\n\nYou've got one job, Strider!\n\nOr maybe you need more.\n\nAnyway, that's the deal with lava boats.\" \u2013 Minecraft Feedback, April 2020.\n\n\u2191 a b c \"Meet the Strider\" by Per Landin.\n\nMinecraft.net, July 7, 2020 \u2191 \"once upon a time Striders were going to get their own unique armor and saddle -

[Java Edition only ] This is not dropped, even if killed with Looting.\n\nZombified piglins spawn in groups of 4 [JE only ] / 2-4 [BE only ] in the Nether at light level 11 and below on most blocks other than nether wart block.\n\nThey spawn most commonly in nether wastes, frequently in nether fortresses, uncommonly in crimson forests and are sometimes found riding striders in lava oceans.\n\nWhen a nether portal block in the Overworld receives a random tick, there is a chance of 1 \u2044 2000 (0.05%) on Easy, 1 \u2044 1000 (0.1%) on Normal and 3 \u2044 2000 (0.15%) on Hard for it to spawn a zombified piglin.\n\nIn Java Edition, they appear inside one of the portal blocks on the bottom.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, they spawn one block to the east or south of the portal (depending on which direction the portal is facing).\n\nNeither slabs nor lighting prevents this.\n\n\"Portal ticking\" can be used to increase the rate of zombified piglin spawning by repeatedly lighting and breaking a nether portal.\n\nZombified piglin spawning via this process is completely independent of the mob cap, similar to the spawning of phantoms in Java Edition, which means they can still spawn if there are a sufficient number of hostile mobs in the world.\n\nZombified piglins who spawn in this way cannot travel to the Nether for a preset amount of time, whether they walk through the portal they spawned in or through nearby portals. [Java Edition only ] A zombified piglin spawns when lightning strikes within 4 blocks of a pig.\n\nIf the pig is a piglet, it then transforms into a baby zombified piglin.\n\nA piglin or piglin brute that enters the Overworld or the End transforms into a zombified piglin after 15 seconds.\n\nWhen piglins wielding crossbows zombify, they keep their crossbows, but are unable to use them, and perform melee attack like other zombified piglins.\n\nWhen baby piglins zombify, they do not have weapons, unlike baby zombified piglins that naturally spawn.\n\nWhen piglin brutes zombify, they keep their axes.\n\nThe newly zombified piglin gets the Nausea effect for 10 seconds.\n\nThis is a purely visual effect, and does not affect the mob's behavior.\n\nA zombified piglin keeps any armor or weapons collected before being zombified [JE only ].\n\nBaby zombified piglins also have a 5% chance of becoming a chicken jockey [Java Edition only ].\n\nIf a piglin is in the middle of bartering and gets zombified while inspecting a gold ingot, it drops the ingot when it turns into a zombified piglin.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Zombified piglin farming 0\u20131 rotten flesh.\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-4 with Looting III.\n\n0\u20131 gold nugget s.\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-4 with Looting III.\n\n1 gold ingot (2.5% chance) if killed by a player or tamed wolf, or upon death when angry.\n\nThe chance is increased by 1% per level of Looting, for a maximum of 5.5% with Looting III.\n\nThere is an 8.5% [JE only ] or 25% [BE only ] chance to drop their original weapon if killed by a player or tamed wolf, or upon death when angry.\n\nThe chance is increased by 1% [JE only ] or 5% [BE only ] per level of Looting, for a maximum of 11.5% [JE only ] or 40% [BE only ] with Looting III.\n\nThe death animation does not include the weapon if it was dropped.\n\ngolden sword (sometimes enchanted) golden axe if zombified from a piglin brute crossbow if zombified from a piglin warped fungus on a stick if spawned riding a strider After a piglin transforms into a zombified piglin, it drops any acquired armor and held weapons upon death.\n\n5 for adults or 12 for babies if killed by a player or a tamed wolf, or dies while in an angered state [1].\n\nAn additional 1\u20133 is dropped if it does not drop its golden sword upon death.\n\nZombified piglins wander aimlessly about when idle.\n\nThey move at 2.28 m/s and are immune to fire and lava.\n\nWhen provoked, their speed increases to 3.38 m/s or faster for babies.\n\nIn Java Edition, like zombies, zombified piglins can attack wooden doors and may break them on Hard difficulty.\n\n[2] In Normal and Hard difficulties, up to 55% [JE only ] or 25% [BE only ] of zombified piglins pick up any armor pieces and swords better than their golden one, which they always drop when killed.\n\nThis also prevents them from despawning.\n\nZombified piglins may pick up an illager banner next to it [BE only ] as pillagers do.\n\n[3] Zombified piglins try to destroy any turtle eggs they see within 23 blocks away horizontally and 3 blocks away vertically (10 blocks horizontally and 2 blocks vertically in Bedrock Edition), not counting the block they are standing in.\n\nWhen a zombified piglin is first spawned, it always detects nearby turtle eggs after exactly 2 seconds, as long as there are two blocks of air above it.\n\nHowever, if the turtle egg is placed after the zombified piglin spawned, the zombified piglin takes some time to notice the turtle egg and try to break it.\n\nZombified piglins avoid walking near magma blocks and cannot jump over magma blocks one block high.\n\nIf a zombified piglin is surrounded by magma block wall one block height or higher, it gets near those surrounding magma blocks surrounding them.\n\nIf a zombified piglin spawns on or is pushed onto magma blocks, it pathfinds normally on the magma.\n\nZombified piglins do not retreat from zoglins, soul torches/lanterns, soul fire or soul campfires.\n\nZoglins attack zombified piglins on sight, causing a retaliation.\n\nZombified piglins are not distracted by gold, and cannot barter, unlike piglins.\n\nThey also do not follow players that are holding a gold ingot or another gold item.\n\nVillagers and wandering traders run away from zombified piglins, despite them being passive to villagers and wandering traders. [BE only ] In addition, piglins squeal in distress and flee from zombified piglins if they get too close.\n\nZombified piglins ignore piglins unless provoked, which can happen when a piglin with a crossbow shoots a zombified piglin by accident.\n\nZombified piglins will not become aggressive if a player attacks and/or kills a regular piglin.\n\nIron golems attack zombified piglins, which causes other zombified piglins to attack the iron golem.\n\nA zombified piglin is neutral to every mob that can attack, but they retaliate and gang up on any mob that provokes them.\n\nUndead, they are: Damaged by the status effect Instant Health and healed by the status effect Instant Damage.\n\nThrowing an instant damage splash potion does not anger them, since it heals them.\n\nUnaffected by the status effects Regeneration and Poison.\n\nIgnored by the wither and affected by Smite.\n\nUnable to swim in water, but do not drown.\n\nZombified piglins are not initially hostile, but all zombified piglins within a 67\u00d722\u00d767 to 111\u00d722\u00d7111 area [JE only ] or a 20-block radius [BE only ] centered on an attacked zombified piglin become aggressive and converge on the attacker (another mob or player, except goats and ghasts) if any individual is attacked, unless the zombified piglin attacked is killed in one hit.\n\n[4]  [JE only ] They make an aggressive sound when angered.\n\nIn addition, some zombified piglins have the ability to spawn reinforcements when attacked (similar to zombies and which can rarely include actual zombies). [JE only ] This applies to any hit registered as coming from the player or other mobs, whether its accidentally or purposefully, which includes deflected ghast fireballs, sweep attacks, snowballs and eggs, fireworks shot from crossbows, TNT, or a skeleton arrow.\n\nArrows shot from dispensers or bed explosions [5] don't provoke zombified piglins.\n\nDuration: A zombified piglin can remain hostile indefinitely if it is both within the follow range of the zombified piglin (33 to 55 blocks), and has a direct line of sight with the player.\n\nHowever, breaking one of those conditions causes a hostile zombified piglin to return neutral after a \"forgiveness timer\" expires.\n\nIn Java Edition, this timer ranges from 20 seconds to 55 seconds, whereas in Bedrock Edition it is always 25 seconds.\n\nThe forgiveness timer does not advance for zombified piglins in unloaded chunks.\n\nTherefore, if the player enters a nether portal and returns, any provoked zombified piglins in the area remain aggressive (unless another player was nearby to keep the chunks loaded).\n\nA player's death causes zombified piglins to become neutral toward the player if the gamerule forgiveDeadPlayers is true. [JE only ] A hostile zombified piglin can also \"sound an alarm\", spreading the aggro to all zombified piglins within a 67\u00d722\u00d767 to 111\u00d722\u00d7111 area  [JE only ] or 20-block [BE only ] radius.\n\nA hostile zombified piglin does this whenever the targeted player is within their follow range (33 to 55 blocks) and has a constant line-of-sight with its target, then it does the same every 4\u20136 seconds (80-120 game ticks), recruiting any formerly-neutral peers.\n\nThey pursue players even if they have the Invisibility effect.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a nearby neutral zombified piglin prevents a player from sleeping, as if it were a hostile mob.\n\nHostile zombified piglins have slightly different path finding than when they are neutral.\n\nFor example, they would fall off edges that would cause them fall damage in attempt to reach the attacker where most other mobs would otherwise not do.\n\nWhen a zombified piglin is angered, the normal piglins do not get aggressive, and vice versa.\n\nUnlike other zombie variants, zombified piglins do not attack villagers and wandering traders.\n\nIf caught in the Nether with few items or no gold armor, staying near zombified piglins is a good strategy in Java edition.\n\nAggravated piglins will be too afraid to approach the player, and any nearby skeletons shooting at the player will be quickly killed by the zombified piglins.\n\nThey do not become angry at the player if a mob hits them while trying to attack the player, though they have done so in versions of Pocket Edition.\n\nJava Edition: Zombified piglins use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b MC-226770 \u2191 \"[MC-218122] Unused sound event: minecraft:entity.zombie.attack_iron_door - Jira\" \u2013 Mojira, March 8, 2021.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Zombified piglins have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Additional fields for mobs that can become angry Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Tags common to all zombies Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Zombified Piglin\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe pre- Texture Update zombie pigman texture file has \"THX XAPHOBIA\" written on the unused section as a credit by Notch to the skin's original creator.\n\nDeaths of hostile zombified piglins always register as kills by the player they are targeting, regardless of whether that player ever touched that zombified piglin.\n\n[1]  [Java Edition only ] The zombified piglin's angry sound is played twice the speed of the original sound file in the game. [JE only ] Applying the Classic Texture Pack changes the zombified piglin's model and texture back to a zombie pigman. [Bedrock Edition only ] There is a glitch where the zombified piglin texture appears as the zombie pigman even without the Classic Texture Pack. [Bedrock Edition only ] In Minecraft Legends, Piglins don't zombify in the Overworld because they breathe in Nether Wart spores.\n\n[11] In the Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nepisode Girl in the Flower Dress, Jemma Simmons mentions a zombified piglin (known as zombie pigman at the time) as the \"rather nasty mob\" in one of the episode's fictional character's \"runs\" in Minecraft.\n\n[12] In the 15 Year map, the Zombified Piglin uses the Piglin's sound files as opposed to its own.\n\nA zombified piglin with a crossbow that can be found only when a piglin with a crossbow is zombified in the Overworld.\n\nA zombified piglin riding a strider.\n\nA zombified piglin chicken jockey.

there is a 1% chance for it to increase by 2.\n\nWhen the amount reaches 5, honey can be seen dripping from the bottom and front of the hive/nest.\n\nA hive/nest must have 5 honey inside before a player can collect honeycombs or honey bottles.\n\nA bee coming out of a bee nest.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Honey farming Bees live together in colonies and take any bee nest or beehive that has enough space as their home.\n\nOne bee nest or beehive can house up to 3 bees.\n\nHomeless bees wander around, searching for empty beehives.\n\nBees can enter a beehive from any side, but exit only from the front.\n\nOne-way bee-gates can be made in this way.\n\nBees return to their nest when it rains or when it is night.\n\nThey return even when in biomes that don't rain like desert.\n\nThey stay in their nest or hive for at least 2400 game ticks (2 minutes) before coming back out.\n\nThe bees that come out keep their data (health, name, etc.).\n\nBreaking a nest or hive that contains bees releases all the bees.\n\nIf a bee nest containing bees is harvested using a tool enchanted with Silk Touch, the bees inside are kept, with their corresponding data, in the hive.\n\nThey can exit the hive again when it is placed.\n\nWhen a bee that has pollen enters and then leaves its nest or hive, the honey level of the nest or hive is increased by one.\n\nWhen the honey level of that hive reaches 5, the player can harvest it, which then sets it back to 0.\n\nBecause there is neither daylight cycle nor weather in the Nether and the End, bees work without resting in these dimensions.\n\nThis behavior is distinct from that of the villagers, which follow their daily routine according to the time in the Overworld, regardless of which dimension they are in.\n\nMain article: Damage All bees nearby are angered when an individual bee is attacked (unless the bee attacked is killed in one hit [Java Edition only ]), honey or honeycombs are collected (unless a campfire is placed under the nest), or a beehive is destroyed.\n\nHitting or walking on a nest does not anger bees; it must be destroyed to anger them.\n\nWhen destroyed, a beehive releases any bees that it contained, and the bees will be angry.\n\nIf the beehive is destroyed with a Silk Touch tool, bees outside the hive become angry  [Bedrock Edition only ], [8] while those kept within it remain neutral even after the hive is placed again.\n\nThe Invisibility effect does not cause stingers in stung players to disappear.\n\nBees attack and swarm the player as a group when angered, and the eyes of angered bees turn blood red.\n\nCollecting a honeycomb or a honey bottle from a nest or hive causes the bees that are currently in that nest or hive to leave and swarm the player unless a campfire is placed below the hive.\n\nBees attack only once, similarly to llamas and non-aggressive pandas.\n\nBees do not deal any damage in Peaceful difficulty.\n\nIf the player deflects a bee's attack with a shield, the bee continues attacking until it succeeds in hitting the player.\n\nWhen a bee's attack on a player succeeds, the player is poisoned.\n\nA bee loses its stinger after a successful attack, cannot attack further, and dies approximately one minute later.\n\nThis can be delayed with potions (Regeneration / Resistance / Absorption) that have a 255 potency.\n\nIt is possible to (quickly) breed at least one angered bee with another, even if it or they had stung and lost the stinger.\n\nHowever, they remain angered and still die later due to having lost their stingers.\n\nBees also swarm and attack other mobs when damaged;

[BE only ] They are immune to guardians or elder guardians attacks.\n\nThey also have a small chance to be immune to knockback when damaged.\n\n[3] Some drowned spawn with the ability to pick up loot that is on the ground.\n\nThat includes armor and weapons or tools just like regular zombies.\n\nUnlike zombies however, they can also pick up tridents, which they always prefer over anything else.\n\nThey also can pick it up and throw it the wrong way.\n\nDrowned can be damaged by a fully-powered conduit within 8 blocks.\n\nIf one drowned gets attacked by another drowned's trident, the attacked drowned ignores it.\n\nA drowned swimming in Bedrock Edition.\n\nA drowned in a river.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition.\n\nDrowned use a swimming animation similar to the player.\n\nThey use this animation whenever they try to pathfind to a player that is either below or above them; if the player is on the same ground level, the drowned simply walk toward them.\n\nDrowned also use this animation if they are tracking a player while they are not standing on a solid block.\n\nTheir hitbox does not change when using this animation.\n\nAlso, if they hold a nautilus shell or anything else in their offhand, their arms are in the same posture as a player's.\n\nWhen attacking, they use the player's attacking animation.\n\nStill, they use the same swimming animation when tracking a player underwater.\n\nIn Java Edition a Trident enchanted with Impaling does not do extra damage to Drowned because they're classified as undead and not aquatic.\n\nThis does not apply in Bedrock Edition as instead a Trident enchanted with Impaling does extra damage to any mob in water or rain.\n\nJava Edition: Drowned use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b MC-177110 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 a b This variable is block-dependent, and varies depending upon the block \u2191 Depends on the drowned's velocity, around 0.003 when moving around underwater with no target.\n\nThe precise equation is the smaller of 1.0 or 0.35\u00d7(the momentum of the drowned, with the horizontal axes multiplied by 0.2) Bedrock Edition: \u2191 a b c MCPE-53297 Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Drowned have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Tags common to all zombies Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nThis page would benefit from the addition of more images.\n\nPlease remove this notice once you've added suitable images to the article.\n\nThe specific instructions are: Render of drowned in Bedrock Edition.\n\nIssues relating to \"Drowned\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nDrowned are not considered as aquatic mobs; instead, they are considered as undead, unaffected by Impaling enchantment.\n\n[7]  [Java Edition only ] A drowned chicken jockey floats to the surface because the chicken it is riding floats, causing the drowned riding it to burn in sunlight during the day, resulting in a chicken in the middle of the ocean or river where the drowned jockey spawned in. [Java Edition only ] In Bedrock Edition, drowned have a 3D outer layer.\n\nThis causes their heads and arms to look larger than in Java Edition and causes rendering conflicts with armor, particularly helmets.\n\nLike spiders and endermen, drowned have eyes that appear to glow, although they do not produce light.\n\nAn unreleased drowned texture.\n\nThree drowned mobs that spawned naturally in an ocean biome.\n\nA group of drowned attacking the player.\n\nDrowned within a coral reef.\n\nA drowned attacking a pufferfish after being attacked by it.\n\nDrowned can sometimes spawn in ocean ruins in positions that they can't get out of.\n\nA drowned wearing armor.\n\nThis occurs only on drowned zombies, not naturally spawned drowned.

they also make loud and lengthy sounds while being stared at.\n\nIf the player continues to maintain eye contact, the enderman does not move [Java Edition only ], although it may teleport away.\n\nOnce the player stops looking at the enderman, it runs toward the back of the player to attack, although it ceases if hit by another player or mob.\n\n[2] An aggravated enderman runs fast and often teleports to the location of a player or mob up to 32 blocks away (orthogonally).\n\nEndermen are not provoked by a player viewing it through a transparent block or while wearing a carved pumpkin.\n\nAn aggravated enderman pursues the player until it is either killed or distracted by external elements, such as rain or fire.\n\nThey do not take damage from sunlight like undead mobs, but when at a sufficient light level under the sky during the day they teleport randomly, typically winding up in caves (although certain non-full blocks, such as soul sand and mud, also register as \"dark\" when the enderman is standing in them).\n\nEndermen can be harmed by melee attacks, water, lava, fire, splash water bottles, or rain.\n\nThey are not damaged when standing in a filled cauldron  [Java Edition only ].\n\n[3] Endermen teleport away when they take damage from any of natural sources (1), continuing to do so until they find a safe location.\n\nThey also teleport while taking damage from other sources, such as suffocation, Poison, or Wither.\n\nRanged attacks are largely ineffective against endermen, as they teleport when hit by a projectile instead of taking damage.\n\nEndermen that are hit by projectiles do not become hostile.\n\n[4] Arrows  [Java Edition only ] and tridents appear to bounce off an enderman who is unable to teleport.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, arrows go straight through endermen that are unable to teleport (but the effect still goes through if it's a tipped arrow).\n\n[needs in-game testing ].\n\nRocket crossbows do affect endermen and can trigger endermen hostility toward the shooter.\n\nEndermen can step up one full block without having to jump.\n\nEndermen are hostile to endermites within 64 blocks but are passive to other mobs unless provoked.\n\nAn enderman in a player's vicinity prevents the player from sleeping in a bed at night as if any hostile mob were nearby.\n\nIf the player is already asleep in a bed, it is possible for an enderman to teleport on it and wake players by pushing them off.\n\nThe endermen's aggression range for being looked at is reduced when the player is sneaking, or under the Invisibility effect depending on the number of armor pieces currently worn.\n\nThe detection range in blocks for invisible players is shown in the following table: They play a sound exclusively at the teleportation destination.\n\n[5] Each teleportation attempt chooses a random destination 32 blocks along each axis (i.e.\n\na 64\u00d764\u00d764 cube centered on the current position).\n\nIt then applies the following checks: As long as the selected block is not a made of a movement-blocking material, seek downwards.\n\nIf the found block is waterlogged, the teleportation attempt fails.\n\nStarting again with the originally selected target, seek downwards as long as the block below is not a made of a movement-blocking material.\n\nThe teleportation attempt succeeds if no liquid or solid blocks prevent them from standing at the destination.\n\nThus, endermen need at least three non-solid blocks above the destination to successfully teleport, and do not teleport to waterlogged blocks unless the ceiling above is made of a non-waterlogged movement-blocking material.\n\n[6] Blocks that have a large enough collision box but are not made of a movement-blocking material, such as carpet that is not above a block made of a movement-blocking material, snow layers 10 or more deep, and azalea, can be used to prevent teleportation.\n\nEndermen always teleport an integer Y distance, so an enderman at Y=70.0 cannot teleport onto a movement-blocking block covered by a single carpet, snow layers only 2 deep, or many other short blocks, while an enderman at Y=70.99 could teleport onto snow layers 8 or 9 deep.\n\nEndermen always attempt to teleport upon taking damage.\n\nMost melee attacks are successful, but the enderman usually teleports a few blocks behind the player when hit, if there is space behind the player.\n\nEndermen can be attacked with projectiles if they are in a boat or minecart. [Java Edition only ] If all available blocks within teleport distance are removed or unavailable as a destination, it is possible to hit endermen in Java Edition with a projectile, although arrows may simply bounce off, dealing no damage.\n\n[7] When teleporting due to damage, it makes 64 attempts to teleport.\n\nIn Java Edition, an enderman cannot teleport while it is in a minecart or boat, although in rain and water it attempts to do so, always teleporting back repeatedly until death.\n\nThis does not occur in Bedrock Edition.\n\n[8] Unlike any other mobs, which cannot hold blocks except as items, endermen have a unique ability to pick up, carry and set down certain blocks.\n\nThey silently [9] pick up blocks in a 4\u00d73\u00d74 (xyz) region horizontally centered on the enderman and vertically encompassing it.\n\nAn enderman cannot pick up blocks in a completely flat area.\n\nEndermen drop the block they are holding upon death as an item, although they do not visually let go of the block when dying.\n\n[10] [11] It does not despawn while holding a block.\n\nEndermen cannot place blocks onto bedrock or entities.\n\nEndermen can pick up the following blocks: Cactus Clay Coarse Dirt Rooted Dirt Dirt Flowers (short) Fungi Roots Grass Block Gravel Melon Moss Block Mud Muddy Mangrove Roots Mushrooms Mycelium Nylium Podzol Pumpkins Red Sand Sand TNT Data packs from Java Edition can change this list by modifying the minecraft:enderman_holdable block tag.\n\nBedrock Edition behavior packs can not modify these as the list is hard-coded behind the minecraft:behavior.enderman_take_block method.\n\nWhile carrying a block, the enderman sometimes silently [12] places it in a 2\u00d72\u00d72 region horizontally centered on the enderman and vertically at the same level as the enderman itself if the target location is air with a non-air block beneath and the block is allowed to be placed at the target location.\n\nEndermen cannot pick up or place down blocks if the game rule mobGriefing is set to false.\n\nEndermen can randomly breach walls, bridge fences, break redstone circuitry, set off explosions and kill themselves if they place a block of TNT on a power source and even construct golems by removing or placing blocks.\n\nEndermen can pick up or place down blocks even when angry.\n\nIn Java Edition, users can summon an enderman holding any block (including the ones not listed above) using the carriedBlockState NBT data.\n\nFor example, to summon an enderman holding a grass block with no AI where the player is standing: /summon minecraft:enderman ~ ~ ~ {NoAI:1,carriedBlockState:{Name:\"grass_block\"}} Java Edition: Endermen use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock

maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe developers have stated that the belief that enderman sounds are backward distortions is just speculation.\n\n[21] Notch claimed in public that the enderman is a \"subtle reference\" to the Slenderman, a similar-looking monster with a similar name.\n\nGiven the later development of the End, it is possible he already had the name in mind, and did not choose it because of the Reddit thread in which their name was revealed.\n\n[22] According to Burnie Burns, former CEO of Rooster Teeth, the idea for endermen's weakness to water came from his son JD during a visit to Mojang's headquarters.\n\n[23] Dinnerbone suggested \"a haunting of endermen\" as the collective noun for Endermen.\n\n[24] Additionally, in the third episode of Minecraft: Story Mode, The Last Place You Look, a player is given the option to correct the grammar of other characters by specifying that the collective noun for a group of endermen is \"a haunting of Endermen\".\n\nIn the fourth Minecraft novel Minecraft: The End, the collective term used by endermen themselves is \"an End of Endermen\".\n\nSwitching to spectator mode and taking an enderman's point of view adds a shader that inverts colors, suggesting that they see the End as an island of blue cobblestone (as end stone is a yellowish version of cobblestone with inverted colors) in a white sky, with white pillars, white endermen with green eyes and a white ender dragon, also with green eyes.\n\nThey also see cobblestone as end stone.\n\nThe texture for an enderman's eyes is located in a different texture file than the body, allowing their eyes to glow.\n\nBecause the two textures do not line up perfectly, forcing an enderman to look straight up causes its eyes to turn blank white.\n\nThis also causes the enderman's eyes to be visible even when under the Invisibility effect.\n\nThe enderman teleportation sound also plays when a player teleports using an ender pearl  [Bedrock Edition only ] or chorus fruit.\n\nThe enderman is a playable DLC character in the crossover fighting game Super Smash Bros.\n\nUltimate as an alternate costume for Steve, though with altered proportions to be at Steve's height.\n\nAdditionally, there is an enderman \"spirit\" that makes the user vulnerable to damage by water, as are regular endermen.\n\nEndermen are trying to bring about the collapse to all dimensions, as revealed in the 2019 book Minecraft Game Design.\n\n[25] Enderman holding a grass block Enderman holding sand Enderman holding a cactus Enderman holding TNT Enderman

MCD:Fox.\n\nFor the animal in Minecraft Legends, see MCL:Fox.\n\nFox Red Fox Red Kit Snow Fox Snow Kit Health 10  [JE only ] 20 \u00d7 10  [BE only ] Classification Animal Behavior Passive (Wild or trusting player) Neutral (Trusting different player) Spawn Grove Snowy Taiga Old Growth Pine Taiga Old Growth Spruce Taiga Taiga Damage Easy and Normal: 2 Hard: 3 Usable items Glow Berries Lead Sweet Berries Details Size Adult: Height: 0.7 Blocks Width: 0.6 Blocks Baby: Height: 0.35 Blocks Width: 0.3 Blocks A fox is a passive mob that spawns in taigas, old growth taigas, snowy taigas and mountain groves.\n\nThey are able to carry a single item in their mouth, but prefer food over other items.\n\nFoxes spawn in groups of two to four in taiga, old growth taiga, snowy taiga and grove biomes.\n\n5% of them spawn as baby foxes.\n\nThey can spawn on grass, coarse dirt, podzol, snow blocks, or top snow.\n\nFoxes that spawned in a snowy biome are white.\n\nFoxes have a 20% chance to spawn (via spawn egg or naturally) with one of the following items in their mouth: An adult fox drops 1\u20132 [JE only ] / 1\u20133 [BE only ] experience orbs when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nUpon successful breeding, 1\u20137 are dropped.\n\nKilling a baby fox yields no experience.\n\nFoxes always drop any item they pick up and are still holding (they cannot drop food that they have eaten, for example) and drop items they spawn with naturally with a 100% chance, so: If a fox is killed while holding a totem of undying, then the fox consumes the totem and revives itself instead of dropping the totem.\n\nFoxes occasionally make loud screeches during nighttime, unless a trusted player is near them.\n\nBaby foxes follow adult foxes.\n\nDuring the night, foxes sometimes go to villages.\n\nSnow foxes go to snow villages and red foxes go to any other type of village, preferably taiga villages since foxes spawn in the taiga biome.\n\nFoxes flee from nearby wolves, polar bears or players unless the player approaches them while sneaking.\n\nThey take no damage or speed reduction while moving through sweet berry bushes.\n\nAn animation showing a fox's jump during an attack on a chicken.\n\nFoxes attack chickens, rabbits, cod, salmon and tropical fish, and baby turtles while they are on land.\n\nFoxes don't attack wolves even if they are being attacked by them.\n\nFoxes attack either by running against or by pouncing.\n\nLike rabbits and goats, foxes can pounce more than one block high without status effects or player input.\n\nA fox prepares to pounce by tilting and lowering its head and lowering its body to become shorter.\n\nThen it leaps two blocks into the air, jumping over fences and walls if needed.\n\nIf the target mob moves from its location during this sequence, the pounce misses the target.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, foxes also shake side to side before pouncing and their legs wave while in midair.\n\nWhile foxes are capable of jumping over fences and walls, they cannot see through them.\n\n[1] A fox will not try to attack a mob on the same y-level if there is a fence between them.\n\nRed foxes prefer to attack chickens, rabbits and baby turtles, all of which are on land, over cod, salmon, and tropical fish; conversely, snow foxes prefer to attack cod, salmon and tropical fish over land-dwelling creatures.\n\nA snow fox stuck in a snow layer when attacking.\n\nA fox that pounces into a snow layer becomes momentarily stuck, remaining face-down, emitting particles while shaking, and returning to normal shortly after.\n\nFoxes swim to attack fish in water for food.\n\nBaby foxes following adults into the water cannot swim and may eventually drown.\n\nFoxes attempt to run toward the closest attackable mob, even if attached to a lead, but do not attempt to break the lead.\n\nA fox wakes up from sleeping to attack a mob.\n\nWild wolves are aggressive toward foxes when within 18 [JE only ] /16 [BE only ] blocks.\n\nIn Java Edition, adult polar bears also sneak toward foxes to attack them; in Bedrock Edition adult polar bears attack foxes within 16 blocks.\n\nIn Java Edition, baby polar bears, though normally passive to players, also attempt to attack foxes within 16 blocks or when their adult polar bear attacks one.\n\nFoxes are one of the few mobs in the game that can sleep, along with cats, villagers and bats.\n\nDuring the day, if a thunderstorm is not occurring, foxes attempt to find a space with a sky light level of 14 or less and sleep.\n\nBlock light has no effect on this.\n\nWhile it sleeps, it slowly moves its head up and down.\n\nA fox wakes if approached by a player or mob.\n\nFoxes do not flee if the player approaches while sneaking until the player gets on an adjacent block.\n\nIf the sky light at the fox's position becomes 15 or above, either due to a block above being destroyed or the fox being moved, the fox wakes up.\n\nFoxes can drop and pick up items in their sleep.\n\nTrusting foxes can fall asleep even if attached to a lead.\n\nThey can also be moved with leads while sleeping.\n\nFoxes do not sleep if they are within 12 blocks of an armor stand.\n\nA fox sits down sometimes during the day if the fox cannot find a shaded area to sleep.\n\nThe fox sits for a short time, then hops back up.\n\nFoxes sit down even when attached to a lead or in a boat.\n\nFoxes that have not been bred by the player always sit while in the Nether, even while attached to a lead.\n\nIf any item is on the ground near a fox, it travels to the item and picks it up, and the item appears in the fox's mouth.\n\nHowever, usually a fox chooses to attack a mob over picking up an item.\n\nThis behavior is not limited to food and animal products; a fox can pick up any item that the player can pick up.\n\nHowever, they prefer to pick up food items, and if they have already picked up non-food items, they drop the non-food items to pick up food instead.\n\nA fox can also swap a food item it is holding for a different food item.\n\nA fox eats any food item it picks up (besides cake) after 30 seconds and the fox is affected by any side effects from the food, such as poison or teleportation.\n\nFor example, if a fox eats an enchanted golden apple, it obtains the absorption and effects of the enchanted apple.\n\nIf a fox eats any type of soup or stew, an empty bowl is dropped.\n\nIf a fox is holding a chorus fruit, it eats the fruit and teleports accordingly.\n\nIf there is a stage 3 or 4 sweet berry bush within a 16 block radius of a fox, it sprints toward the bush and eats the berries, dropping the item it was holding.\n\nIt is the only mob not damaged by the sweet berry bush.\n\nIf a fox picks up a weapon or an item with enchantments, such as Looting and Fire Aspect, these items affect the fox's attack as if the fox is wielding the weapon in its main hand, although the item retains its durability when used by the fox.\n\nIf a fox is holding a totem of undying, it receives the effects after taking fatal damage.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, if a fox wields a sword with the Fire Aspect enchantment while attacking a mob on a campfire or a soul campfire, it ignites the campfire and does critical damage to the entity.\n\nFoxes do not pick up items when gamerule mobGriefing is set to false.\n\nWhen sweet berries or glow berries are used on two foxes, the foxes breed, producing a baby fox.\n\nIf a red fox is bred with an snow fox, the baby has a 50% chance of being either red or snow.\n\nBreeding two adults with sweet berries or glow berries produces a kit that trusts the player.\n\nThe baby fox trusts the player that bred it and does not flee from that player as it grows up; however, because baby foxes also follow nearby adult foxes, an adult running away from the player may cause the baby to do the same.\n\nNaturally spawned kits do not trust players.\n\nFoxes attack specific mobs that hurt a player they trust.\n\nA tamed fox with an egg inside its mouth, notice it doesn't run away from the player.\n\nA lead can be useful during this time to keep the baby fox from fleeing until it has finished maturing to an adult itself, or the player can simply kill the adult foxes with a ranged weapon.\n\nA fox that trusts the player flees from wolves and polar bears unless the wolf or polar bear attacks the player, in which case the fox attacks in defense of the player.\n\nWhen attacking phantoms, foxes do not jump to attack.\n\nA trusting fox does not attack a tamed wolf unless the fox doesn't trust the player who tamed the wolf.\n\nFoxes that trust the player attack zombies, drowned, husks, zombified piglins, skeletons, wither skeletons, strays, phantoms, silverfish, endermites, spiders, cave spiders, vexes, vindicators, evokers, pillagers, ravagers, blazes, endermen, goats and pandas, when those mobs attack the player.\n\nThey do not attack any mob the player attacks, unlike tamed wolves.\n\nThey also do not attack zombie villagers despite the fact that they are a zombie variant.\n\nTamed foxes retreat from polar bears and wolves but not tamed wolves.\n\nA tamed wolf whose owner attacks a tamed fox also attacks the fox.\n\nJava Edition: Foxes use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 1.0 for all except idle1, which is 0.8 \u2191 0.9 for all except

hold an item in its mouth, it is technically holding the item in its main hand, therefore anything held affects it, such as a sword increasing its damage or a totem of undying resurrecting it.\n\nIn the real world, some species of fox jump high to catch their prey by surprise, an action reflected in their Minecraft counterpart.\n\nWhen foxes were being added into Minecraft, a glitch occurred where they looked like boxes.\n\n[3] Baby foxes are small enough that when they are swimming, they take drowning damage.\n\nThis is noticeable when they attempt to attack fish.\n\nThere is a splash

    "content": "For the DLC mob in Minecraft Dungeons, see MCD:Goat.\n\nGoat Goat Kid Health 10 Classification Animal Behavior Neutral Spawn Frozen Peaks Jagged Peaks Snowy Slopes Damage Adult Easy: 1 Normal: 2 Hard: 3 Baby: 1 Usable items Bucket Wheat Lead Details Size Adult: Height: 1.3 Blocks Width: 0.9 Blocks Baby: Height: 0.65 Blocks Width: 0.45 Blocks A goat is a neutral mob found in certain mountainous biomes.\n\nGoats can jump especially high, and ram mobs.\n\nThey are a source of goat horns and milk.\n\nGroups of two to three goats spawn above stone variants of opaque blocks on snowy slopes, jagged peaks, and frozen peaks at the surface at a light level of 7 or higher.\n\nGoats can spawn individually after the world generation, albeit less often.\n\n5% of all goats spawn as babies.\n\nWhen a goat is spawned naturally or through breeding normal goats, it has a 2% chance of being a screaming  [JE only ] / screamer  [BE only ] goat.\n\nThey look identical to all other goats, but they make screaming sounds and ram more often.\n\nAdult goats drop 1\u20133 when killed by a player or tamed wolf, while 1\u20137 is dropped upon successful breeding.\n\nKilling a baby goat yields no items or experience.\n\nA goat when both horns are knocked off.\n\nGoats drop a goat horn when they charge into a solid block.\n\nThese include stone, coal ore, copper ore, iron ore, emerald ore, logs, and packed ice.\n\nIn Java Edition, these blocks are listed under the snaps_goat_horn tag, and can be modified using a data pack.\n\nThere are 4 horn variants for normal goats (\"Ponder\", \"Sing\", \"Seek\", and \"Feel\"), and 4 horn variants that only screaming goats drop (\"Admire\", \"Call\", \"Yearn\", and \"Dream\").\n\nGoats do not regrow their horns; therefore, up to two horns can be dropped per goat.\n\nWhen left to wander, goats tend to ascend hills and mountains rather than keep to lowlands.\n\nTheir behavior is marked by jumping high and by opportunistically ramming non-moving mobs.\n\nGoats take 10 less fall damage and avoid walking into powder snow.\n\nGoats do not get hurt by pointed dripstone if they fall on it from a minimum of six blocks, and do not die from pointed dripstone if they fall on it from a minimum of ten.\n\nA goat usually jumps when trying to cross an obstacle like a small hole in the ground or powder snow.\n\nIt lowers its head, then it leaps up to 10 blocks vertically and up to 5 blocks laterally.\n\nOnce a goat jumps this way, it cannot do it again for 30 to 60 seconds.\n\nA goat also never voluntarily jumps more than 5 blocks down, although a goat can be pushed off a higher cliff by another mob or a piston.\n\nStanding on a honey block prevents a goat from jumping.\n\nEvery 30 to 300 seconds, a goat tries to ram a single unmoving target it can see within a range of 4\u201316 blocks.\n\nThey can target players, armor stands, or any mob except for ghasts and other goats.\n\nA charging goat locks on to its target's position, lowers its head, stomps, and speeds toward the target.\n\nIf the charge connects, it deals 1 to 3 damage (depending on difficulty) and 9 blocks of knockback to its target, possibly resulting in a damaging or even fatal fall.\n\nThis attack is not affected by Thorns.\n\n[1] As a goat lowers its head, its target has the chance to move out of the way.\n\nIf a goat misses, it stops itself within a couple blocks, unless it hits a solid block first.\n\nIf a goat rams a solid block that occurs naturally in its environment, it can drop one of its two goat horns.\n\nMobs do not retaliate to being rammed, except for piglins, piglin brutes, hoglins, zoglins, and wardens.\n\n[2] Goats do not target players in Creative mode or any players in Peaceful difficulty.\n\nUnlike most neutral mobs, goats do not attack the player if the player attacks it, and it does not call for backup if harmed.\n\nBaby goats deal a knockback of 4.5 blocks.\n\nA screaming goat's ramming cooldown is 5 to 15 seconds.\n\n[more information needed ] An adult goat can be milked by using a bucket on it, yielding a milk bucket.\n\nMain article: Breeding Goats follow players that are within ten blocks who are holding wheat.\n\nIf adult goats are fed wheat, they enter love mode and breed, granting one to seven experience orbs.\n\nThe growth time of a baby goat can be accelerated by 10% each time it is fed wheat.\n\nIf a standard goat is bred with a screaming goat, there is approximately a 50% chance the resulting baby is a screaming goat.\n\nIf both goats are screaming, there is a 100% chance that the baby is a screaming goat.\n\nBaby goats only have horns if they are summoned through one of two commands: / summon goat ~ ~ ~ {Age:-24000, HasLeftHorn:1} or / summon goat ~ ~ ~ {Age:-24000, HasRightHorn:1}.\n\nThe goat's third hurt sound (screaming) and its first ramming preparation sound (also screaming) are the same, but pitched differently; the former is pitched higher than the latter.\n\nThe goat's fourth death sound (regular) is its first ambient sound (also for regular goats) but lower pitched.\n\nThe goat's second ramming preparation sound (screaming) is its fifth ambient sound (also screaming) but higher pitched.\n\nThe goat's first and third ramming preparation sounds (both for screaming goats) are its first ramming preparation sound (regular goats) but heavily edited.\n\nJava Edition: Goats use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nGoats use the Hostile Creatures sound category for some sound events.\n\n\u2191 0.84 for all except idle1 and idle2, which are 0.82, and idle7, which is 0.83 \u2191 0.9 for all screaming sounds;

participating villagers need to fulfil the previous 3 conditions When gossiping, at least 5 participants are needed When panicking, at least 3 are needed A valid spawn point for the golem is found Iron golems still spawn even when the game rule doMobSpawning is set to false.\n\n[1] To find a valid spawn point, up to 10 attempts are made to spawn a golem within a 17\u00d713\u00d717 box centered on the villager (villager block position \u00b18 blocks along x/z axes and \u00b16 blocks along y axis).\n\nA random y column is picked and then the topmost block in that column is selected that is air or liquid and has a \" solid-blocking \" block underneath.\n\nThe target location then goes through the following checks: the block underneath must have a solid top surface (which is not the same as \"solid-blocking\").\n\nthe target block must not be a full block, nor be redstone-powered, nor be rails.\n\n(already the block above the target block is known to be air or liquid) the block two blocks up from the target block must not be a full block, nor be redstone-powered, nor be rails, and additionally must not be water.\n\nThis means the iron golem can spawn inside 1-deep water or inside blocks like slabs, fences, and carpets, if other checks pass.\n\nAdjacent blocks are irrelevant, so golems can spawn partially-inside adjacent solid blocks.\n\n[2] However, the spawning iron golem still must not collide with any existing entities.\n\nBedrock Edition In Bedrock Edition, an iron golem can spawn naturally when a village first generates in the world.\n\nIron golems also spawn in villages having at least 20 beds and 10 villagers.\n\nThe golem attempts to spawn in a 17\u00d713\u00d717 volume, \u00b18 blocks horizontal and \u00b16 blocks vertical from the village's center block, which can be (but isn't necessarily) a bed pillow or a bell.\n\nFirst, X and Z coordinates are randomly chosen within the spawn volume, then the highest block at those coordinates within the spawn volume is found.\n\nIf it is a block with a full top surface\u2014which includes upside-down stairs and top slabs (does not include glass)\u2014and there is no obstruction above it by a block above the spawn volume, then the golem is spawned there.\n\nOtherwise the spawn attempt is canceled.\n\nFor a village to spawn iron golems, 75% of the villagers in the village must have worked (i.e.\n\nstood beside or atop their workstation) in the past day, 100% of the villagers must be linked to a bed, and the village center must be within a player's simulation distance volume.\n\nThe maximum distance the player can be from the village for iron golems to spawn can be calculated with the following formulas.\n\nThese are only approximate because they yield a volume with a rectangular cross section, but the simulation distance volume is roughly rounded and omits the corner chunks.\n\nH o r i z o n t a l = 8 \u00d7 S i m u l a t i o n D i s t a n c e + 32 {\\displaystyle \\mathsf{Horizontal} = 8 \\times \\mathsf{SimulationDistance} + 32} V e r t i c a l = 8 \u00d7 S i m u l a t i o n D i s t a n c e + 12 {\\displaystyle \\mathsf{Vertical} = 8 \\times \\mathsf{SimulationDistance} + 12} If the village's original iron golem is killed, a new one cannot spawn unless all of the conditions are met.\n\nTherefore, a small village does not regenerate an iron golem unless the village is expanded.\n\nIf the spawn conditions are met, then the chance of attempting a spawn is 1 \u2044 700 per game tick, which averages to one spawn attempt every 35 seconds.\n\nIron golems can spawn provided the 2\u00d73\u00d72 space above the spawn point (that is, horizontally centered on the northwest corner of the block it spawns on) contains only non-full blocks, and the block it spawns on is solid.\n\nIron Golem build configuration.\n\nIron Golem build configuration 2.\n\nIron golems are created by placing four iron blocks in a T shape (as shown in the image), and then placing a carved pumpkin or jack o'lantern on top of the center upper block.\n\nThe pumpkin may be placed by the player, a dispenser or an enderman, but it must be placed last.\n\nIt needs at least one block of space around the bottom iron block to be able to spawn and cannot spawn in a confined area; even grass can prevent an iron golem from spawning.\n\nAlternatively, the blocks can be placed in any order with an uncarved pumpkin; the player can shear the pumpkin to spawn the golem.\n\nWhen successfully transformed, it is naturally passive toward all players under all circumstances.\n\nIt can, however, attack the player\u2019s tamed wolves, if punched accidentally, but it never directly attacks the player.\n\nThe constructed golem attacks hostile mobs like a naturally spawned iron golem.\n\nThe block arrangement can be placed upright, lying down, or upside-down.\n\nThe four empty spaces in the diagram (above and below each of the arms) must be air blocks.\n\nAny non-air block (including blocks such as snow layers, grass, and water) present in any of the empty spaces prevent the golem from spawning.\n\nIn Java Edition, the player can place a pumpkin on the four blocks of iron, then shear the pumpkin.\n\nThe iron golem still spawns like normal.\n\nLike other constructed mobs, iron golems always spawn facing south.\n\nTheir large size may cause them to take suffocation damage from nearby solid blocks at the level of their head.\n\nDropping a pumpkin on the correct arrangement of iron blocks does not spawn a iron golem.\n\nMain article: Tutorials/Defeating a pillager outpost An iron golem found within one of the cages surrounding an outpost.\n\nIron golems can also be found surrounding pillager outposts, confined inside dark oak cages.\n\nWhen freed, they can help the player by attacking any nearby pillagers.\n\nPillagers do not attack iron golems in cages, although the iron golem can attack any pillagers that are one block near the cage, because iron golems can attack through a one-block wall.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Iron golem farming Iron golems drop when they die: 3\u20135 Iron Ingot s 0\u20132 poppies Killing an iron golem with a weapon enchanted by Looting has no effect on the number of iron ingots or poppies dropped.\n\n[3] Trading prices are unaffected by the killing of iron golems; however, village popularity decreases by 10, affecting village iron golem behavior if the popularity ranges below -15 [BE only ].\n\nAn iron golem offering a poppy.\n\nIron golems wander around a village in a patrol-like fashion, staying close to buildings and other structures.\n\nLike villagers, iron golems do not wander away from a village, regardless of how they were spawned, but sometimes stand at the border of the village.\n\nAn iron golem sometimes faces a villager as if they are conversing.\n\nIron golems can spawn poppies in their hands and offer them to villagers, symbolizing the friendly relationship between villagers and iron golems.\n\nBaby villagers accept the poppy offered by the iron golem. [Bedrock Edition only ] [4] Attacking an iron golem that is not player-built while the iron golem is holding out a poppy causes it to take back the poppy and attack the player instead.\n\nIf the iron golem sees a target while it is offering the poppy, it runs toward the target and kills the target instead.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, iron golems completely ignore villagers, pushing them aside while walking if a villager is in the iron golem's path, but they still offer poppies if possible.\n\nIf not within a village, iron golems slowly wander around attacking hostile mobs (skeletons, zombies, etc.), usually making their way to a nearby village.\n\nIf in that village, the iron golem doesn't leave.\n\nIron golems can walk up a full block height without jumping and walk over a 1 block wide hole without falling in.\n\nThey avoid water, lava, fire, and cactus.\n\nIron golems are immune to both drowning and fall damage.\n\nWhen in water, they sink, but can still move freely.\n\nWhen an iron golem's health reduces to 75%, cracks appear on its surface.\n\nAn iron golem can be healed when the player right-clicks the chest of the iron golem with an iron ingot.\n\nThis action consumes the ingot.\n\nAs with all utility mobs, iron golems can be leashed.\n\nThe leashed iron golem does not try to break from the lead when it sees a hostile mob.\n\nInstead, it looks at the mob while moving.\n\nAn iron golem that is leashed in mid-air moves its arms and legs while moving.\n\nIf an iron golem is leashed to a fence, it attacks the hostile mob but does not follow the mob if the hostile mob goes out the attack range, as the iron golem cannot break free from fence leads.\n\nIn Java Edition, when iron golems move when provoked, they look like if they're taking strides toward the mob.\n\nIron golems that aren't provoked move slower in Java Edition.\n\nIron golems move faster in Bedrock Edition, as it walks like its normal walking speed, either when provoked or not provoked.\n\nIron golems cannot pick up weapons or armor, but the player can use NBT commands in Java Edition to give the iron golem weapons or armor, although the armor or weapons are not visible.\n\nWhen attacking, an iron golem moves quickly toward its target and swings its arms up violently to attack, flinging the target into the air, and dealing 7.5 \u00d7 3.75 to 21.5 \u00d7 10.75 damage in Normal difficulty.\n\nIron golems have a large attack range, allowing them to attack through a solid 1 block thick wall, even without a line of sight to the target.\n\nWhen an iron golem attacks, it also deals a long knockback range.\n\nIron golems cannot attack targets that are three blocks high above the same ground level as the golem.\n\nIt is possible for multiple golems to hit the same target simultaneously, flinging the victim to a height proportional to the number of golems that attacked.\n\nThe mob/player flung can die from fall damage.\n\nIf an iron golem attacks a group of zombies, for example, it targets one zombie to attack until that zombie dies before it attacks a different zombie, even while other zombies are attacking at the same time.\n\nThe iron golem attacks hostile mobs that attack it in order.\n\nIf the mob is flung out of sight, the iron golem attacks the next mob that attacks it.\n\nSometimes, the iron golem might attack the nearest hostile mob if they are in groups.\n\nWhen an iron golem kills any mob, the player can obtain items dropped by the mob, but no experience orbs.\n\nIron golems that kill a raid mob In Bedrock Edition also causes the mob to drop its raid loot, even when the mob wasn't attacked by the player before it is killed.\n\nIron golems never attack each other, as iron golems cannot \"accidentally\" hit another iron golem when attacking.\n\nAn iron golem built by a player never attacks players, even when hit or when the player attacks another villager or another golem in front of the player-built golem.\n\nA player-built golem attacks the player's tamed wolf if the wolf attacks the golem.\n\nA naturally-spawned iron golem becomes hostile toward a player who attacks a villager near an iron golem.\n\nAlso, if a player has -15 popularity or less in a village, or has -100 or lower reputation with any nearby villager, naturally-spawned iron golems become hostile to that player until the player's popularity climbs above -15 and reputation with all nearby villagers goes above -100.\n\nA village iron golem retaliates when attacked by a player (even throwing an ender pearl at an iron golem provokes it).\n\nIf a village has more than one naturally-spawned iron golems and a player attacks one in front of the other(s), all of iron golems in that type may become hostile to the player.\n\nIron golems are not provoked by players who attack wandering traders.\n\n[5] If a golem spawns from its spawn egg, it will behave in the same way as village golems.\n\nThrowing a positive splash potion or a positive lingering potion does not anger iron golems.\n\nAlthough they are guardians of villages, iron golems are not actually provoked when a mob attacks a nearby villager (in contrast to a player attacking a villager).\n\nWith the exception of creepers, ghasts, and goats (although they still can attack ghasts if close), they are provoked when attacked by any mobs, and by the presence of nearby monsters.\n\nEven if a witch accidentally throws a positive splash potion at an iron golem during a raid, this does not stop the iron golem from attacking the witch.\n\nIron golems are ineffective against flying hostile mobs that don't venture into the iron golem's reach, such as phantoms.\n\nThe list below contains mobs (including players) that can have hostile interactions with iron golems.\n\nThe iron golem also attacks neutral mobs or hostile mobs that attack the player such as piglins or zombified piglins.\n\nAn iron golem looks down at a husk, but cannot attack the husk.\n\nA naturally-spawned iron golem knows where raiding illager locations are from behind solid walls and from underground and attempts to move toward them.\n\nAn iron golem created by the player or summoned by a command cannot detect raiders through obstructions.\n\nIron golems also looks down or looks up if the hostile mob is above or below the iron golem.\n\nZombies (and variants), zoglins, skeletons (and variants), silverfish, [BE only ] spiders, cave spiders, magma cubes, [JE only ] withers, illagers, and witches  [BE only ] naturally attack iron golems on sight and may cause major damage, especially if the mobs attack in groups.\n\nIron golems have 100% knockback resistance from normal attacks.\n\nThey can still be knocked back by the Knockback enchantment on swords and the Punch enchantment on bows. [Java Edition only ] Iron golems have different stages of being cracked to show their health.\n\nWhen their health is above 74 \u00d7 37, they do not have any cracks.\n\nWhen their health is between 50 \u00d7 25 and 74 \u00d7 37, some cracks appear.\n\nWhen their health is between 25 \u00d7 12.5 and 49 \u00d7 24.5, they appear more cracked.\n\nWhen their health is lower than 25 \u00d7 12.5, many cracks are visible.\n\nNo deterioration More than 75% of health remaining Low deterioration More than 50% but no more than 75% of health remaining Average deterioration More than 25% but no more than 50% of health remaining Strong deterioration No more than 25% of health remaining Using an iron ingot on an iron golem restores its health by 25 \u00d7 12.5.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition.\n\nSee also: Villager \u00a7 Preferred path Like villagers, iron golems in Bedrock Edition use a strategy of pathfinding that prioritizes walking on certain \"low-cost\" blocks.\n\nIron golems attempt to walk on a one-block-wide path, despite them being two blocks wide.\n\nAn iron golem favors a wider path if it sees one.\n\nIron golems can climb ladders or vines if the ladder or vine is in its path, or if pushed onto a ladder or vine.\n\nJava Edition: Iron golems use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 Can be 1.0 or 0.8 for each sound Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Iron golems have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Additional fields for mobs that can become angry Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs PlayerCreated: 1 or 0 (true/false) - if true, this golem is player-created and never attacks players.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Iron Golem\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nRobot from Laputa: Castle in the Sky The iron golem's holding out flowers to villagers is a reference to the ancient robots in Hayao Miyazaki's animated film Laputa: Castle in the Sky.\n\n[10] When baby villagers notice the poppy in its hand, they slowly approach, and take the flower eventually.\n\n[4] Iron golems do not actually pick up poppies; they spawn them in their hands.\n\nIron golems do not get into boats or minecarts on their own, although in Bedrock Edition, pushing a minecart on rails into a golem forces it into the minecart.\n\nIt is possible for an enderman to cause an iron golem to spawn by placing a pumpkin in the correct position on an arrangement of iron blocks previously placed by the player.\n\nThe iron golem is a purchasable avatar item on the Xbox 360 Marketplace.\n\nIt is impossible to spawn an iron golem holding a poppy using a command (such as summon or data).\n\nIts NBT matches with a naturally generated golem (HandItems:[{id:\"minecraft:poppy\",Count:1b},{}]), but does not visually update.\n\nCreation of an iron golem.\n\nAn iron golem offers a villager a poppy.\n\nAn iron golem offers a poppy to several villager children.\n\nAn iron golem attacking a spider by throwing it into the air.\n\nAn iron golem attacking a witch.\n\nAn iron golem attacking the player.\n\nIron golems acting strangely in a player-created village, by attempting to cross in a two-block-high gap.\n\nTwo iron golems bump their heads.\n\nFirst image of iron golem.\n\nAn Iron Golem in promotional artwork for the Horse Update.\n\nAn Iron Golem in promotional artwork for Minecon 2015.\n\nIron Golems in promotional artwork for the Village and Pillage Update.\n\nOfficial Iron Golem artwork.\n\nAnother official Iron Golem artwork.\n\nVillager and Iron Golem Spirit from Super Smash Bros.\n\nUltimate.\n\nThe Secret Iron Golem, featured in the Trails & Tales Event.\n\nLego Minecraft Iron Golem.\n\nOfficial T-shirt artwork made by JINX.\n\nOfficial T-shirt artwork \"Minecraft Heroes Crest\" which depicts an iron golem and an ender dragon.\n\nMade by JINX.\n\n\u2191 MC-111004 \u2014 Iron golems do not follow the doMobSpawning gamerule \u2191 MC-189332 \u2191 MC-200707 \u2014 Looting does not increase drops for iron golems and cats \u2191 a b Baby villagers have not accepted poppies in Java Edition since the Village & Pillage update due to a bug MC-159069.\n\n\u2191 MC-153693 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 MC-195326 \u2191 MC-254100 \u2014 Iron golem spawn rate decreased \u2191 MC-189872 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 MCPE-74428 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 \"@scambot Yes, thanks to @pgeuder who sent me inspirational pictures!\" \u2013 @jonkagstrom (Jon K\u00e5gstr\u00f6m) on X, February 23, 2012 Meet the Iron Golem \u2013 Minecraft.net on February 27, 2017 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

[Bedrock Edition only ] 1\u20133, if killed by a tamed wolf or the player.\n\nBaby pandas have a 1 \u2044 700 chance to drop 1 slimeball after they sneeze.\n\nUpon successful breeding, 1\u20137 is dropped.\n\nLike other baby animals, killing a panda cub yields no items or experience.\n\nPandas act similarly to other neutral mobs; they attack when hurt but only once, similar to llamas and bees.\n\nPandas do not attack on Peaceful difficulty.\n\nPandas follow any player that is carrying bamboo and stop following if the player moves beyond approximately 16 blocks away.\n\nThey also whimper if a thunderstorm is happening in the area.\n\nAdult pandas seek out bamboo and cake to eat.\n\nBaby pandas have a 1 \u2044 6000 chance (0.01666%) of sneezing every tick.\n\nWeak baby pandas are more likely to sneeze with a 1 \u2044 500 (0.2%) chance every tick.\n\nSneezing makes all adult pandas within 10 blocks jump and rarely drops a slimeball.\n\nBaby pandas also occasionally roll over and jump around.\n\nPandas have one private inventory.\n\nPandas can be ridden by baby zombie variants. [Bedrock Edition only ] A lead cannot be used on a panda by normal means.\n\n[3] However, a panda can be leashed using a map editor or NBT editor.\n\nIf a panda is being attacked by a player near a villager, that villager displays angry particles. [Java Edition only ] However, it does not affect the popularity of the player.\n\nThe different variations of pandas \u2013 from left to right: brown, lazy, worried, playful, weak, aggressive and normal.\n\nPandas have different personalities: normal, lazy, worried, playful, aggressive, weak, or brown.\n\nNormal pandas: Identifiable by their frown.\n\nDo not have unique personality actions.\n\nLazy pandas: Identifiable by their smile.\n\nLie on their backs.\n\nAre slower than normal pandas, making them the slowest land mob in the game.\n\nDo not follow a player who is holding bamboo while they're lying on their back. [JE only ] In Bedrock Edition, if a player is holding bamboo, a lazy panda stops lying on its back and starts following that player.\n\nA worried panda shaking and hiding its face during a

out.\n\nRoll over and jump around even as adults.\n\nThe ability to roll may sometimes cause harm or kill the panda as it can accidentally roll off a cliff or into other environmental hazards.\n\n[4] Aggressive pandas: Identifiable by their thick eyebrows and tight frown.\n\nWhen hit, an aggressive panda attacks the player and other mobs continuously until the target dies or goes beyond detection range, instead of only once.\n\nIt also doesn't panic when harmed.\n\nWhen nearby pandas are attacked, unless killed in one hit, [JE only ] aggressive pandas becomes hostile toward the attacker.\n\nAre slow, but have reach rivaling that of the player.\n\nWeak pandas: Identifiable by their teary eyes and snotty noses.\n\nTend to sneeze more often as babies than regular baby pandas, and have half the health of other pandas.\n\nBrown pandas: Identifiable by their brown color and frown.\n\nDo not have unique personality actions, but are brown and white instead of the usual black and white.\n\nThe panda is the only animal to have extra breeding conditions.\n\nIn Java Edition, pandas enter love mode when fed with bamboo, but will only breed if there is at least one bamboo block (not including shoots) within a five-block radius; [verify ] otherwise the pandas will briefly shake their heads and not breed until that requirement is met.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, there must be at least 8 bamboo blocks within a five-block radius of each panda in order for them to enter love mode.\n\nIf a panda is fed without a sufficient amount of bamboo nearby, it sits and eats the bamboo instead of entering love mode.\n\nOnce pandas successfully breed, they produce a panda cub which remains passive instead of neutral toward that player.\n\nEach panda has two hidden values called \" genes \" or \"alleles\", as found in genetics.\n\nPandas have a main gene and a hidden gene, each assigned to a particular trait.\n\nNormal, aggressive, lazy, worried, and playful personalities are dominant traits, while weak and brown personalities are recessive traits.\n\nIf the main gene is a dominant gene, then it will present as the personality regardless of the hidden gene.\n\nIf the main gene is recessive and the hidden gene is not the same trait, then a normal personality results.\n\nAs recessive traits, weak and brown personalities occur if both the main and hidden genes of a panda are weak or brown, respectively.\n\nThe hidden gene is only relevant in determining the panda's personality if the main gene is recessive.\n\nWhen two pandas breed, each one passes one of their genes to their children, who then randomly mix both obtained genes as their respective main and hidden genes.\n\nThere is also a 1 \u2044 32 chance for each gene of the baby to mutate into another gene.\n\nNormal, weak, and brown traits more commonly result from mutations than other traits do.\n\nThese probabilities also apply to naturally spawned pandas for their main and hidden genes.\n\nThe only way to directly observe the hidden gene of a panda is to use the command: / data get entity @e[type=minecraft:panda,limit=1] HiddenGene  [Java Edition only ] or using third-party NBT editors.\n\nJava Edition: Pandas use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 Can be 0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 for each sound, except eat5, which can be 0.425, 0.85, or

A piglin is a neutral mob found in the Nether.\n\nIt is hostile to players unless they wear at least one piece of golden armor.\n\nIt can be given gold ingots to barter for various items.\n\nIt wields either a golden sword or a crossbow, and uses either melee or ranged attacks, respectively.\n\nBaby piglins do not grow up, never hold weapons or attack, and take gold without giving anything in return.\n\nPiglins spawn in groups of 2-4 in nether wastes and crimson forest biomes, and within bastion remnants upon generation, at a light level of 11 or less in Java Edition, or 7 or less in Bedrock Edition on most blocks other than nether wart blocks or magma blocks.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, they can naturally spawn even in Peaceful difficulty.\n\nEach piglin has a 20% [Java Edition only ] or 5% [Bedrock Edition only ] chance of spawning as a baby.\n\nPiglins have a 50% chance of spawning with either a sword or a crossbow.\n\nThey also have a 10% chance per armor slot of spawning with golden armor, meaning they have a 34.39% chance of spawning with any armor and a 0.01% chance of spawning with a full set.\n\nPiglins spawn in Peaceful difficulty, but are passive to players.\n\nAdults have an 8.5% chance of dropping the held item (a golden sword or crossbow with random durability).\n\nEach Looting level increases this chance by 1%.\n\nBabies spawn without equipment.\n\nIn Java Edition, a picked-up item always drops with the same durability as when picked up.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, armor picked up by piglins can lose durability and even break depending on how much damage the piglin takes.\n\nPiglins do not drop gold ingots, raw porkchops, or cooked porkchops that they have picked up.\n\nIn both versions, a piglin also drops a piglin head when killed in the vicinity of the explosion of a charged creeper.\n\nIf a piglin is killed in one hit while admiring a gold ingot, the gold ingot is dropped upon the piglin's death.\n\nAdults sometimes spawn with 1-4 pieces of armor, which can be: Golden Helmet Golden Chestplate Golden Leggings Golden Boots These have a chance of being enchanted.\n\nThese are dropped with an 8.5% chance and random durability.\n\nIn addition to their drops, piglins can also pick up other types of armor, including wearable items from the player.\n\nAdults drop 5 and an additional 1\u20133 per armor piece if killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nBaby piglins only drop 1.\n\nPiglins snort enviously while watching players holding a gold-related item or anything else.\n\nLike villagers, piglins can open and close wooden doors but cannot open fence gates, all trapdoors, and iron doors.\n\nPiglins cannot swim and can drown if submerged.\n\n[1] Unlike zombified variant, they are not naturally immune to fire or lava.\n\n[2] Idle piglins are afraid of zombified piglins, zoglins, soul fire, soul torches, soul lanterns, and lit soul campfires.\n\nIf a piglin comes within a certain distance of any of these things, it will squeal in fear and run away until the object or mob is out of its sight range.\n\nHostile piglins lose their fear of soul fire items, but they will still flee from zombified piglins and zoglins and will not approach the player if they are near either of these mobs.\n\nBaby piglins additionally retreat from wither skeletons and withers, but adult piglins will attack these on sight.\n\nCrossbow piglins do not reload their crossbows when spawned, unlike pillagers.\n\nThey reload only when provoked.\n\nBaby piglins are passive and play with baby hoglins, running around and riding upon them.\n\nUp to 3 baby piglins may stack on top of each other while riding a baby hoglin.\n\nThey can be given gold, but they do not give anything in return and run away.\n\nThey can also pick up and wear armor as well as hold gold tools or weapons.\n\nHowever, they are unable to pick up leather.\n\nIn addition, baby piglins never grow up.\n\n[3] If the player attacks a piglin, this action will not aggravate zombified piglins in the area.\n\nInfighting between these two mobs can start when an aggravated piglin carrying a crossbow shoots a zombified piglin by accident.\n\nWhen this happens, all nearby zombified piglins will become angry and pursue the piglin until it is either killed or runs out of their sight range.\n\nAdult piglins are neutral if the player is wearing at least one piece of golden armor.\n\nPiglins are provoked by any player who: Is not wearing any piece of gold armor.\n\nPiglins have short ranged detection for this.\n\nResults in light aggravation.\n\nAttacks the piglin.\n\nPiglins have long ranged detection for this.\n\nResults in heavy aggravation.\n\nAttacks another piglin or piglin brute, regardless of whether the player kills it in one hit or not.\n\nPiglins have long ranged detection for this.\n\nResults in medium aggravation.\n\nOpens a chest, trapped chest, ender chest, [4] shulker box, [5] barrel, minecart with chest, or boat with chest.\n\nPiglins have short ranged detection for this.\n\nResults in medium aggravation.\n\nBreaks a block of gold, gold ore, gilded blackstone, nether gold ore, block of raw gold, deepslate gold ore, or any of the blocks listed above.\n\nPiglins have medium ranged detection for this.\n\nResults in medium aggravation.\n\nIllustration of short range aggravation of piglins.\n\nNote the spherical range, and that piglins behind walls are not aggravated due to the line of sight being blocked.\n\nShort range: When a piglin has been aggravated by a player not wearing gold armor, or opening a container, piglins from up to around 15 blocks centered around the player become aggravated by the player if there is a straight line of sight to the player.\n\nMedium range: When a piglin has been aggravated by a player breaking a golden block or a container, piglins from up to 16 blocks from the player\u2019s feet become aggravated.\n\nNo line of sight is required.\n\nLong range: When a piglin has been aggravated by a player damaging a piglin or piglin brute, piglins from up to 16 blocks from the damaged piglin (rather than the player) become aggravated.\n\nNo line of sight is required.\n\nLight aggravation occurs when a piglin has been aggravated by a player not wearing gold armor.\n\nThe piglin can de-aggravate when the player puts on gold armor, distracts the piglin with gold, or the piglin loses a line of sight with the player.\n\nMedium aggravation occurs when a piglin has been aggravated by a player opening/breaking a container or breaking a golden block, or when a piglin witnesses a piglin brute or another piglin getting damaged by a player.\n\nPiglins under medium aggravation can be distracted with gold.\n\nA piglin already under light aggravation does not re-aggravate to medium aggravation.\n\nThis means that if a piglin knows a player broke a golden block near them after already going after them due to them not wearing gold armor, the player can de-aggravate that piglin by putting on gold armor or losing the line of sight despite the fact that the player broke the golden block.\n\nHeavy aggravation occurs if a piglin is damaged.\n\nThe damaged piglin cannot be distracted by gold and is unable to barter while under heavy aggravation.\n\nIf the player is under the influence of the Invisibility effect, they can open containers in front of piglins without aggravating them (short range), although breaking containers or golden blocks still angers them (mid/long range).\n\nPiglins do not react to the opening or breaking of furnace s, blast furnace s, smoker s, dropper s, dispenser s, or brewing stand s.\n\nOpening or breaking a hopper does not provoke the piglins.\n\n[6] Breaking a bell does not provoke them either, despite piglins admiring them as gold.\n\n[7] When a piglin is attacking, it holds its dominant arm and sword in front of it, similarly to a vindicator.\n\nAdult piglins are hostile toward wither skeletons and withers.\n\nThey congregate within 16 blocks and attack in hordes.\n\nWhen attacking with a crossbow, piglins shoot arrows every 2 seconds.\n\nIn Java Edition, they walk backward (stopping if at the edge of a drop) as soon as the target is close.\n\nIn Java Edition, their crossbows can break if it runs out of durability, [8] making the piglins use their fists, while in Bedrock Edition their crossbows never break.\n\n[9] Unlike mobs armed with bows, they do not strafe from left to right while shooting.\n\nPiglins with swords and other items rush at the target.\n\nIf a group of piglins successfully defeat their target, they gather at the site of their target's demise and emit \"celebration sounds\".\n\nHowever, piglins do not have a chance of dancing unless their target was a hoglin.\n\nWhen a mob attacks a piglin or piglin brute with no AI, other piglins nearby do not attack the mob that attacked the piglin or piglin brute with no AI.\n\nIron golems attack both adult and baby piglins; however, piglins do not attack iron golems without provocation.\n\nThe detection range of piglins is reduced to half of their normal range (17.5 blocks) when the player is wearing a piglin head.\n\nPiglin celebrating dance.\n\nPiglins sometimes attack hoglins, causing other piglins and piglin brutes [Bedrock Edition only ] in that area to attack the targeted hoglin as well.\n\nAdults do not immediately attack adult hoglins on sight, but a piglin has a random chance to make the decision to hunt a hoglin (this decision is almost never made if the piglin recently hunted, but other piglins can still start a hunt).\n\n[verify ] Once that piglin attacks the hoglin, all other piglins and piglin brutes [Bedrock Edition only ] in that area become hostile to the hoglin.\n\nIf outnumbered by hoglins, the piglins flee, making \"retreat\" sounds.\n\nAfter defeating a hoglin, piglins have a 10% chance to do a \"victory dance\" by bobbing their heads and sticking out their arms like a T-pose.\n\nThe more piglins there are, the bigger chance of a hunt might happen (because more piglins that detect the hoglin will each have a 10% chance of

the player's normal walking speed is 0.1.\n\nThe speed listed does not include any status effect that affects the speed of a horse or a player.\n\nSee transportation to compare the speeds of various transportation methods.\n\nJump strength ranges from 0.4 to 1.0, averaging 0.7.\n\nA jump strength of 0.5 is enough to clear 1 19 \u2044 32 blocks, while 1.0 is enough to clear 5 9 \u2044 32 blocks.\n\nThe jump strengths required to clear several block heights are: Skeleton horse sounds are the sounds of the regular horse but lower pitched and slowed with reverb.\n\nJava Edition: Skeleton horses use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b MC-177091 \u2191 The precise equation is as follows: velocity = sqrt  (speed.x 2 \u00d7 0.2 + speed.y 2 + speed.z 2 \u00d7 0.2) {\\displaystyle \\text{velocity}=\\operatorname{sqrt}(\\text{speed.x}^2\\times0.2+\\text{speed.y}^2+\\text{speed.z}^2\\times0.2)} volume = {\\displaystyle \\text{volume}=} (whichever is smaller) 0.1 or (velocity \u00d7 10 {\\displaystyle \\text{velocity}\\times10} if being ridden and velocity \u00d7 8.75 {\\displaystyle \\text{velocity}\\times8.75} if not) \u2191 a b MC-177090 Bedrock Edition: \u2191 This sound event would occur if skeleton horses could have armor equipped.\n\n\u2191 This sound event would occur if skeleton horses could have a chest equipped.\n\n\u2191 Except for stems, Nether wood, cherry wood, and bamboo wood due to MCPE-165012 Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Skeleton horses have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Additional fields for mobs that can breed Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Tags common to all horses SkeletonTrap: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the horse is a trapped skeleton horse.\n\nDoes not affect horse type.\n\nSkeletonTrapTime: Incremented each tick when SkeletonTrap is set to 1.\n\nThe horse automatically despawns when it reaches 18000 (15 minutes).\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Skeleton horse\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nDr.\n\nZhark appears in the credits after the End Poem as the creator of the horses, including skeleton horses.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, skeleton horses can be transported in a boat by riding the skeleton horse and jumping into the boat then dismounting (leaving the horse behind in the boat) and activating the boat from underneath/underwater.\n\nAttempting to activate the boat in order to pilot it from above results in the player being mounted on the horse again rather than being placed inside the boat to pilot it.\n\nA skeleton horse spawned in.\n\nThe four variations of skeleton traps using \"Grumm\" or \"Dinnerbone\" name tags.\n\nSkeleton horses spawned from a trapped skeleton horse.\n\nA player riding a skeleton horse, having killed the skeleton rider.\n\nA player riding a skeleton horse underwater.\n\nIt can run and jump.\n\nSkeleton horse with saddle [Java Edition only ] in survival after defeating the skeleton horse trap.\n\nA skeleton horse in Minecraft Education.\n\nLego Minecraft Skeleton Horse.\n\nHorse Donkey Mule Skeleton \u2191 \"Also big thanks to @DrZhark, the creator of Mo' Creatures, that have assisted us to make it happen!\" \u2013 @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X, April 4, 2013 \u2191 MC-129262 \u2191 MC-121832 \u2191 MC-166246 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\nEntities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

can be tamed and used to assist in combat with most hostile mobs.\n\nWolves spawn naturally above grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, snow blocks, or podzol.\n\nThere are 9 variants of wolf with each has different texture.\n\nThe variant is determined by the biome they spawn in with a default pack size of 4.\n\nThe variants are: Pale wolf: The wolf variant that most players are familiar with.\n\nThis variant spawns in the taiga biome.\n\nWoods wolf: This variant spawns in the forest biome.\n\nThis is the most likely wolf variant that the player can find in the Overworld since forest biome is very common.\n\nAshen wolf: This variant spawns in the snowy taiga biome.\n\nBlack wolf: This variant spawns in the old growth pine taiga biome, in smaller packs of 2-4.\n\nChestnut wolf: This variant spawns in the old growth spruce taiga biome, in smaller packs of 2-4.\n\nRusty wolf: This variant spawns in the sparse jungle biome, in smaller packs of 2-4.\n\nSpotted wolf: This variant spawns in the savanna plateau biome, in larger packs of 4-8.\n\nStriped wolf: This variant spawns in the wooded badlands biome, in larger packs of 4-8.\n\nSnowy wolf: This variant spawns in the grove biome.\n\nThis wolf is a rare type as it doesn't spawn in a pack with other wolves.\n\nNaturally-spawned wolves are untamed and become hostile if attacked by the player.\n\nWhen summoned in other ways (e.g.\n\nusing the spawn egg or using the / summon command), the variant selection follows the natural spawning biome rules with the extensions of the fact that rusty wolf, spotted wolf, and striped wolf are selected in all jungle biomes, savanna biomes, and badlands biomes respectively.\n\nAdult wolves drop 1\u20133 experience orbs when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nA tamed wolf that is killed by its owner still drops experience.\n\nUpon successful breeding, 1\u20137 are dropped.\n\nLike other baby animals, killing a pup yields no experience.\n\nA tamed wolf \"begging\" the player for food.\n\nThree tamed wolves following the player around.\n\nWolves exhibit three different states depending on how the user interacts with them: Untamed wolves have gray fur, a drooping tail, and their eyes consist of a white pixel and a black pixel for the pupil (on each side).\n\nThey are neutral toward the player and hostile toward sheep, rabbits, foxes, baby turtles, and skeletons.\n\nThey avoid llamas, although wolves may attack a llama that spits on them.\n\nThey do not despawn, even if they are in an unloaded chunk, or 32 blocks away from the player.\n\nAngry wolves are characterized by their constant growling and fearsome appearance.\n\nWild wolves become hostile when they are either attacked by a player or mob, if not killed in one hit [1]  [JE only ], or when they see a mob they want to eat.\n\nTheir tail is held out straight, their eyes become red, their mouth is raised in a slight snarl, and they have angry eyebrows.\n\nAngry wolves are hostile only to mobs that attack them, or to the mobs they are hunting.\n\nThey can see attackers even if they are under the invisibility effect, but they cannot track the attacker down, if they get out of their render distance, or the attacker was able to unload the chunk where the wolves were.\n\nAngry wolves cannot be leashed, but a wild wolf may become angry while it is still leashed without dropping the lead.\n\nTamed wolves have friendlier-looking eyes.\n\nThey have a default red collar around their neck, which can be dyed using any color of dye on the wolf.\n\nThis also includes other wolves owned by other player, where any player can dye that wolf's collar.\n\nPressing use on the wolf makes it sit and remain in place and not follow the player around.\n\nTamed wolves that are not sitting attack players or mobs that their owner attacks, or those that injure their owner unless the target has the same owner or is on the same team.\n\nThey do not attack creepers, ghasts, tamed horses or tamed cats, regardless of owner.\n\nStanding tamed wolves attack only skeletons and their variants without provocation.\n\nTamed wolves are always passive to the player, even if the player hits them or kills a tamed wolf on the same team.\n\nA wolf becomes hostile to a player or other mob that attacks it unless the attacker is the wolf's owner, or is otherwise on the same team, or if killed in one hit [JE only ].\n\nIt also causes wild wolves and standing tamed wolves in a 33\u00d733\u00d721 cuboid centered on the attacked wolf to become hostile to the attacker, allowing coordination for attacks and team hunts (only in wild wolves).\n\nIn Java Edition, any tamed wolf attacked by a player/mob causes all standing wolves on that team to attack that player/mob who attacked the tamed wolf.\n\nIf damaged by a mob or entity other than a player or arrow, wolves of any type only take roughly half of the original damage ((damage + 1) / 2).\n\nSkeletons and their variants, foxes, baby turtles and passive rabbits actively avoid both tamed and wild wolves.\n\nKiller rabbits  [JE only ] attack wolves actively.\n\nSheep ignore wolves, but flee when attacked by one.\n\nSheep ignore tamed wolves but also do not flee from them.\n\nWhen a player within 8 blocks holds meat or bones near a wolf, the wolf tilts its head as if to 'beg' for the food for 2 to 4 seconds.\n\nThe behavior of pups is the same as tamed wolves.\n\nPups have larger heads, similar to other animal babies.\n\nWolves are 0.85 [JE only ] or 0.8 [BE only ] blocks tall and pups are 0.425 [JE only ] or 0.4 [BE only ] blocks tall.\n\nThe textures of the wolves are tinted dark gray once submerged in water.\n\nIn Peaceful difficulty, hostile wolves deal no damage to the player.\n\nA tamed wolf shaking off water.\n\nStanding tamed wolves wander randomly when near their owner, but follow if more than 10 blocks away and teleport to a nearby free block (if any) if more than 12 blocks away.\n\nBesides making travel easier, teleportation can be used to rescue them from lava, water or pits, as they immediately teleport to a safe area.\n\nWolves can be told to \"sit\" by pressing use on them and made to stand again with another press of use.\n\nA wolf automatically sits when first tamed.\n\nWhile sitting, they do not follow the player.\n\nHowever, if their owner fights a mob near them, they are still likely to join the fight.\n\nWhen the fight is over, they go back to sitting (if in water, they do not sit until they are on dry land, telling the wolf to sit makes it stand).\n\nThey sit at their new location instead of returning to wherever they were previously.\n\nWolves stand up and follow the player if it is pushed into water or injured while sitting.\n\nWolves can either attack (within 16 blocks) or flee (within 24 blocks) from llamas.\n\nThe wolves' speed is increased by 50% whereas they flee.\n\nWolves find paths to their targets if attacking within 16 blocks, even in difficult terrain.\n\nThey also navigate along the edges of cliffs and occasionally fall far enough to take damage if they leap.\n\nWolves attack their targets running about at the player's walking speed and by leaping at them in exactly the same manner as spiders, but cause no damage while in midair.\n\nTamed wolves attack any animal the player starts to attack.\n\nThey also can navigate and turn around in 1\u00d71 horizontal tunnels.\n\nAfter emerging from water, a wolf shakes the water off their fur.\n\nThis is represented by an animation and water particles.\n\nTamed wolves teleport to their owner, if they are more than 12 blocks away, with a few caveats.\n\nTeleporting resets the focus of a tamed wolf, so if a wolf is attacking a mob and teleports beside a player, it resumes following the player, as its tracking has been reset.\n\nIt is possible for tamed wolves to teleport to an inaccessible location (e.g.\n\nunder ice) and be injured or die of suffocation as a result.\n\nThis happens when the wolf considers transparent blocks, such as glass, or slabs, to be open.\n\nIt cannot teleport when it is sitting.\n\nAn angry or untamed wolf does not teleport.\n\nTamed wolves do not teleport if: The wolf has been ordered to sit.\n\n[2] Exception: The wolf is likely to teleport if it is injured while sitting (it no longer sits after teleporting).\n\nAn example is if a wolf that is sitting is hit by another player, it teleports to their owner.\n\nException: If the wolf is in a loaded chunk, and the player gets damaged by a mob, there's a chance for the wolf to stop sitting, causing them to teleport if the player is far away, then attacking the player's attacker and sitting down afterward.\n\nThe wolf is chasing after a skeleton.\n\nThis can lead to wolves standing and jumping in one place, such as over a cavern if a skeleton is near.\n\nThe wolf teleports once the skeleton is killed.\n\nThe wolf is in a minecart or a boat.\n\nThe wolf has been attached to a fence post with a lead.\n\nThe wolf is in an unloaded chunk.\n\nNone of the blocks on the edge of a 5\u00d71\u00d75 region centered on the player are transparent blocks with a solid block below and another transparent block above.\n\nThe player is in another dimension; a wolf remains in its current dimension until the player returns.\n\nHowever, wolves can be transported to another dimension by pushing them into

[Bedrock Edition only ] The wolf cannot be tamed if it is hostile or already tamed.\n\nWolves that are tamed by the same player can accidentally attack each other while attacking another mob, leading to a fight.\n\nWolves do not get food poisoning, so they can freely eat rotten flesh, pufferfish or raw chicken.\n\nFeeding a tamed wolf that is already at full health usually starts the \" love mode \" animation.\n\nA tamed wolf's necklace/collar color can be changed by using a dye on the wolf.\n\nMain article: Breeding A pup sitting.\n\nTamed wolves at full health can be bred with any type of meat, including rotten flesh and raw chicken without causing the hunger status effect.\n\nThere is a 5-minute cooldown for breeding, during which the wolf does not accept meat.\n\nThe growth of pups can be slowly accelerated using any type of meat.\n\nEach use takes 10% off the remaining time to grow up.\n\nUnlike healing, rabbit stew or any type of fish cannot be used for breeding or speeding up growth.\n\nBreeding two wolves that recognize someone else as an owner causes the pup to also be owned by the owner of the original two wolves.\n\nIf two tamed wolves have different owners, their pups will randomly follow one of their two owners.\n\nIf the player attacks an untamed wolf and then feeds it, hearts appear as when entering breeding mode, although the wolf does not breed and remains aggressive toward the player.\n\nJava Edition: Wolves use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b MC-177522 \u2191 a b MC-177094 Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Wolves have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Additional fields for mobs that can become angry Additional fields for mobs that can be tamed by players Additional fields for mobs that can breed Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs CollarColor: The color of the wolf's collar.\n\nPresent even for wild wolves (but does not render); default value is 14.\n\nMain article: Wolf/DV [edit ] Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nWolves when they were in development uploaded by Jeb as shown below.\n\nThe first screenshot of wolves.\n\n[11] The second screenshot of wolves.\n\nHere, Jeb implemented sitting and has a new texture.\n\n[12] Issues relating to \"Wolf\", \"Wolves\", or \"Dog\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nIf a tamed wolf is named with a name tag, its name is shown in the chat to the owner when killed.\n\nWolves can teleport into transparent blocks.\n\nIn singleplayer, if the player punches a wild wolf and leaves its field of vision, it stares at the player and does not move at all.\n\nGoing back into its range causes it to continue pursuing the player.\n\nA hostile wolf can path-find like most mobs, but may sometimes try to jump across a 1\u20132 block gap to get to a player.\n\nA wolf cannot scale a two-block gap, so it falls, but may still manage to damage the player.\n\nUntamed wolves use their hostile appearance when they are attacking sheep, skeletons, foxes, baby turtles or rabbits.\n\nThey change back once the targeted mob dies or gets out of their range.\n\nAttacking a wild wolf in Peaceful Mode aggravates the wolf and its group, but they do no damage.\n\nA wild pup's head grows significantly when attacked.\n\nIf the player attacks a wolf, but then moves a large distance away (e.g.\n\n70 blocks), the wolf still appears hostile, but exhibits neutral behavior.

[Java Edition only ] This is not dropped, even if killed with Looting.\n\nZombified piglins spawn in groups of 4 [JE only ] / 2-4 [BE only ] in the Nether at light level 11 and below on most blocks other than nether wart block.\n\nThey spawn most commonly in nether wastes, frequently in nether fortresses, uncommonly in crimson forests and are sometimes found riding striders in lava oceans.\n\nWhen a nether portal block in the Overworld receives a random tick, there is a chance of 1 \u2044 2000 (0.05%) on Easy, 1 \u2044 1000 (0.1%) on Normal and 3 \u2044 2000 (0.15%) on Hard for it to spawn a zombified piglin.\n\nIn Java Edition, they appear inside one of the portal blocks on the bottom.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, they spawn one block to the east or south of the portal (depending on which direction the portal is facing).\n\nNeither slabs nor lighting prevents this.\n\n\"Portal ticking\" can be used to increase the rate of zombified piglin spawning by repeatedly lighting and breaking a nether portal.\n\nZombified piglin spawning via this process is completely independent of the mob cap, similar to the spawning of phantoms in Java Edition, which means they can still spawn if there are a sufficient number of hostile mobs in the world.\n\nZombified piglins who spawn in this way cannot travel to the Nether for a preset amount of time, whether they walk through the portal they spawned in or through nearby portals. [Java Edition only ] A zombified piglin spawns when lightning strikes within 4 blocks of a pig.\n\nIf the pig is a piglet, it then transforms into a baby zombified piglin.\n\nA piglin or piglin brute that enters the Overworld or the End transforms into a zombified piglin after 15 seconds.\n\nWhen piglins wielding crossbows zombify, they keep their crossbows, but are unable to use them, and perform melee attack like other zombified piglins.\n\nWhen baby piglins zombify, they do not have weapons, unlike baby zombified piglins that naturally spawn.\n\nWhen piglin brutes zombify, they keep their axes.\n\nThe newly zombified piglin gets the Nausea effect for 10 seconds.\n\nThis is a purely visual effect, and does not affect the mob's behavior.\n\nA zombified piglin keeps any armor or weapons collected before being zombified [JE only ].\n\nBaby zombified piglins also have a 5% chance of becoming a chicken jockey [Java Edition only ].\n\nIf a piglin is in the middle of bartering and gets zombified while inspecting a gold ingot, it drops the ingot when it turns into a zombified piglin.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Zombified piglin farming 0\u20131 rotten flesh.\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-4 with Looting III.\n\n0\u20131 gold nugget s.\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-4 with Looting III.\n\n1 gold ingot (2.5% chance) if killed by a player or tamed wolf, or upon death when angry.\n\nThe chance is increased by 1% per level of Looting, for a maximum of 5.5% with Looting III.\n\nThere is an 8.5% [JE only ] or 25% [BE only ] chance to drop their original weapon if killed by a player or tamed wolf, or upon death when angry.\n\nThe chance is increased by 1% [JE only ] or 5% [BE only ] per level of Looting, for a maximum of 11.5% [JE only ] or 40% [BE only ] with Looting III.\n\nThe death animation does not include the weapon if it was dropped.\n\ngolden sword (sometimes enchanted) golden axe if zombified from a piglin brute crossbow if zombified from a piglin warped fungus on a stick if spawned riding a strider After a piglin transforms into a zombified piglin, it drops any acquired armor and held weapons upon death.\n\n5 for adults or 12 for babies if killed by a player or a tamed wolf, or dies while in an angered state [1].\n\nAn additional 1\u20133 is dropped if it does not drop its golden sword upon death.\n\nZombified piglins wander aimlessly about when idle.\n\nThey move at 2.28 m/s and are immune to fire and lava.\n\nWhen provoked, their speed increases to 3.38 m/s or faster for babies.\n\nIn Java Edition, like zombies, zombified piglins can attack wooden doors and may break them on Hard difficulty.\n\n[2] In Normal and Hard difficulties, up to 55% [JE only ] or 25% [BE only ] of zombified piglins pick up any armor pieces and swords better than their golden one, which they always drop when killed.\n\nThis also prevents them from despawning.\n\nZombified piglins may pick up an illager banner next to it [BE only ] as pillagers do.\n\n[3] Zombified piglins try to destroy any turtle eggs they see within 23 blocks away horizontally and 3 blocks away vertically (10 blocks horizontally and 2 blocks vertically in Bedrock Edition), not counting the block they are standing in.\n\nWhen a zombified piglin is first spawned, it always detects nearby turtle eggs after exactly 2 seconds, as long as there are two blocks of air above it.\n\nHowever, if the turtle egg is placed after the zombified piglin spawned, the zombified piglin takes some time to notice the turtle egg and try to break it.\n\nZombified piglins avoid walking near magma blocks and cannot jump over magma blocks one block high.\n\nIf a zombified piglin is surrounded by magma block wall one block height or higher, it gets near those surrounding magma blocks surrounding them.\n\nIf a zombified piglin spawns on or is pushed onto magma blocks, it pathfinds normally on the magma.\n\nZombified piglins do not retreat from zoglins, soul torches/lanterns, soul fire or soul campfires.\n\nZoglins attack zombified piglins on sight, causing a retaliation.\n\nZombified piglins are not distracted by gold, and cannot barter, unlike piglins.\n\nThey also do not follow players that are holding a gold ingot or another gold item.\n\nVillagers and wandering traders run away from zombified piglins, despite them being passive to villagers and wandering traders. [BE only ] In addition, piglins squeal in distress and flee from zombified piglins if they get too close.\n\nZombified piglins ignore piglins unless provoked, which can happen when a piglin with a crossbow shoots a zombified piglin by accident.\n\nZombified piglins will not become aggressive if a player attacks and/or kills a regular piglin.\n\nIron golems attack zombified piglins, which causes other zombified piglins to attack the iron golem.\n\nA zombified piglin is neutral to every mob that can attack, but they retaliate and gang up on any mob that provokes them.\n\nUndead, they are: Damaged by the status effect Instant Health and healed by the status effect Instant Damage.\n\nThrowing an instant damage splash potion does not anger them, since it heals them.\n\nUnaffected by the status effects Regeneration and Poison.\n\nIgnored by the wither and affected by Smite.\n\nUnable to swim in water, but do not drown.\n\nZombified piglins are not initially hostile, but all zombified piglins within a 67\u00d722\u00d767 to 111\u00d722\u00d7111 area [JE only ] or a 20-block radius [BE only ] centered on an attacked zombified piglin become aggressive and converge on the attacker (another mob or player, except goats and ghasts) if any individual is attacked, unless the zombified piglin attacked is killed in one hit.\n\n[4]  [JE only ] They make an aggressive sound when angered.\n\nIn addition, some zombified piglins have the ability to spawn reinforcements when attacked (similar to zombies and which can rarely include actual zombies). [JE only ] This applies to any hit registered as coming from the player or other mobs, whether its accidentally or purposefully, which includes deflected ghast fireballs, sweep attacks, snowballs and eggs, fireworks shot from crossbows, TNT, or a skeleton arrow.\n\nArrows shot from dispensers or bed explosions [5] don't provoke zombified piglins.\n\nDuration: A zombified piglin can remain hostile indefinitely if it is both within the follow range of the zombified piglin (33 to 55 blocks), and has a direct line of sight with the player.\n\nHowever, breaking one of those conditions causes a hostile zombified piglin to return neutral after a \"forgiveness timer\" expires.\n\nIn Java Edition, this timer ranges from 20 seconds to 55 seconds, whereas in Bedrock Edition it is always 25 seconds.\n\nThe forgiveness timer does not advance for zombified piglins in unloaded chunks.\n\nTherefore, if the player enters a nether portal and returns, any provoked zombified piglins in the area remain aggressive (unless another player was nearby to keep the chunks loaded).\n\nA player's death causes zombified piglins to become neutral toward the player if the gamerule forgiveDeadPlayers is true. [JE only ] A hostile zombified piglin can also \"sound an alarm\", spreading the aggro to all zombified piglins within a 67\u00d722\u00d767 to 111\u00d722\u00d7111 area  [JE only ] or 20-block [BE only ] radius.\n\nA hostile zombified piglin does this whenever the targeted player is within their follow range (33 to 55 blocks) and has a constant line-of-sight with its target, then it does the same every 4\u20136 seconds (80-120 game ticks), recruiting any formerly-neutral peers.\n\nThey pursue players even if they have the Invisibility effect.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a nearby neutral zombified piglin prevents a player from sleeping, as if it were a hostile mob.\n\nHostile zombified piglins have slightly different path finding than when they are neutral.\n\nFor example, they would fall off edges that would cause them fall damage in attempt to reach the attacker where most other mobs would otherwise not do.\n\nWhen a zombified piglin is angered, the normal piglins do not get aggressive, and vice versa.\n\nUnlike other zombie variants, zombified piglins do not attack villagers and wandering traders.\n\nIf caught in the Nether with few items or no gold armor, staying near zombified piglins is a good strategy in Java edition.\n\nAggravated piglins will be too afraid to approach the player, and any nearby skeletons shooting at the player will be quickly killed by the zombified piglins.\n\nThey do not become angry at the player if a mob hits them while trying to attack the player, though they have done so in versions of Pocket Edition.\n\nJava Edition: Zombified piglins use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b MC-226770 \u2191 \"[MC-218122] Unused sound event: minecraft:entity.zombie.attack_iron_door - Jira\" \u2013 Mojira, March 8, 2021.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Zombified piglins have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Additional fields for mobs that can become angry Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Tags common to all zombies Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Zombified Piglin\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe pre- Texture Update zombie pigman texture file has \"THX XAPHOBIA\" written on the unused section as a credit by Notch to the skin's original creator.\n\nDeaths of hostile zombified piglins always register as kills by the player they are targeting, regardless of whether that player ever touched that zombified piglin.\n\n[1]  [Java Edition only ] The zombified piglin's angry sound is played twice the speed of the original sound file in the game. [JE only ] Applying the Classic Texture Pack changes the zombified piglin's model and texture back to a zombie pigman. [Bedrock Edition only ] There is a glitch where the zombified piglin texture appears as the zombie pigman even without the Classic Texture Pack. [Bedrock Edition only ] In Minecraft Legends, Piglins don't zombify in the Overworld because they breathe in Nether Wart spores.\n\n[11] In the Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nepisode Girl in the Flower Dress, Jemma Simmons mentions a zombified piglin (known as zombie pigman at the time) as the \"rather nasty mob\" in one of the episode's fictional character's \"runs\" in Minecraft.\n\n[12] In the 15 Year map, the Zombified Piglin uses the Piglin's sound files as opposed to its own.\n\nA zombified piglin with a crossbow that can be found only when a piglin with a crossbow is zombified in the Overworld.\n\nA zombified piglin riding a strider.\n\nA zombified piglin chicken jockey.

    "content": "This article is about the Minecraft passive mob that collects items.\n\nFor the hostile mob summoned by evokers, see Vex.\n\nFor the mob in Minecraft Dungeons that inspired the allay, see MCD:Wisp.\n\nFor the mob in Minecraft Legends, see MCL:Allay.\n\nAllay Health 20 \u00d7 10 Behavior Passive Spawn Pillager Outpost Woodland Mansion Usable items Any item Details Size Height: 0.6 Blocks Width: 0.6 Blocks The allay (https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:AllayPronunciation.mp3 /\u0259\u02c8le\u026a/ uh-\u029f\u1d00\u028f) is a flying passive mob that collects and delivers items for any player that gives it something or any note block it hears recently playing.\n\nAllays can be found surrounding pillager outposts, confined inside dark oak cages.\n\nOne to three allays can spawn in each cage.\n\nThey have a 50% chance of spawning here.\n\nTwo allays inside a woodland mansion cell.\n\nAllays can also spawn inside jail cells within woodland mansions.\n\nOne to three allays can spawn in each cell.\n\nThey have a 50% chance of spawning here.\n\nAllay can be duplicated/bred by playing a Music Disk in a Jukebox with Allay nearby and then clicking the Allay with a Amethyst Shard while they are dancing.\n\nUnlike other mobs only 1 allay is needed for breeding/duplication and they have no baby variant.\n\nThe allay's luminous texture allows it to be seen clearly in the dark, although it doesn't illuminate its surroundings.\n\nThe allay is small, peaceful and flies aimlessly until a player gives it an item with their use key.\n\nThe allay starts following the player and seeks out dropped versions of the same item to deliver them to its player.\n\nThe allay returns to wandering around if any player takes its item back by using an empty hand on it.\n\nThe allay locks onto the player that last gave it an item.\n\nThis allay follows the player from up to a 64-block cubic area away and seeks items up to a 32-block cubic area away from the player.\n\nAfter delivering items, the allay has a delay of three seconds until it can seek items again.\n\nAn allay has a single inventory slot to hold a stack of items (usually 64 items) in addition to the item it got from the player.\n\nWhile the allay does not discern enchantments, special item names or items in shulker boxes when it seeks, it still carries such items in separate trips.\n\nAllays don't pick up any items if the game rule / gamerule mobGriefing is set to false, but the player can still give the allay items with the use key.\n\nIf the allay hears a note block play within 16 blocks of its location while delivering items, it will instead deliver its items to the note block and then spend 30 seconds around that particular note block, seeking items around it and returning them to it instead of its player.\n\nThe allay returns to targeting its player after 30 seconds.\n\nA vibration particle emanates from the note block and reaches the allay to indicate the allay has locked on to the note block.\n\nBecause the allay and the note block interact via a vibration particle, placing wool between the note block and the allay can prevent this sound interaction.\n\nThe allay can pick up items within a radius of about 1.3 blocks from itself and drop items up to 3 blocks away from its player or note block.\n\nAn allay performs a dance animation when there is a nearby jukebox playing.\n\nIf the jukebox stops playing or if the allay gets too far away from the jukebox, it stops dancing.\n\nIf the allay is given an amethyst shard while dancing, it plays a small amethyst sound, makes a heart animation and duplicates into another allay.\n\nAfter that duplication, both allays have a five minute cooldown before being able to duplicate again.\n\nThe allay cannot enter water, although it attempts to gather items that are under water.\n\nThe allay will, however, seek out water when on fire and douse itself [1].\n\nAllays cannot be harmed by their interacted owners.\n\nIf they are harmed by another source, they fly away for a few seconds.\n\nWhen killed, allays drop the items they were holding.\n\nIf an allay dies while holding a totem of undying, it instead returns to full health and the totem is destroyed, as with any mob holding a totem of undying.\n\nAllays naturally regenerate 2 per second if damaged.\n\nIn Java Edition, using a lead or a named name tag performs the item's normal function, instead of giving it to the allay.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition.\n\nAllays in the End.\n\nWhen a player teleports through a nether portal, the player's allay teleports also, even if it does not enter the portal.\n\nWhen a player teleports through an end portal, the allay teleports to the End only if a player gives the allay an item before teleporting and must be nearby the player as they teleport.\n\nAllays holding an item follow the player through a portal if they are 21 blocks horizontally to the player or if they are within 22 blocks vertically of the player's legs.\n\nAllays do not travel through portals regardless of how close they are if they are tethered to a fence with a lead.\n\nJava Edition: Allays

tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe advancement, \"You've got a friend in me\" is named after the opening song of the 1995 computer animated Disney and Pixar film, Toy Story.\n\nThe allay was originally planned for the Nether Update.\n\n[4] Some previous names considered for the allay were the wisp and the pixie.\n\n[4] The allays were created to solve the problem of how players would build structures and collect resources in Minecraft Legends while focusing on defending the overworld.\n\n[5] The reason why allay duplication uses amethyst shards is because the item is renewable, has a musical sound that fits with the allay, and it adds more value to amethyst geodes.\n\n[6] [7] According to the \"meet the allay\" article on Minecraft.net, the reason why allays can be tamed by players is because they form a \"magical connection\" when that player gives it an item.\n\nThis bond is what prevents players from accidentally harming their allay.\n\n[8] Originally, Mojang considered having allays naturally spawn within forest biomes.\n\nHowever, the reason they went with pillager outposts and woodland mansions, was because they wanted to highlight the companionship aspect.\n\n[9] It has also been theorized that the reason for why Illagers capture Allays in the first place is likely because of their connection with the Vexes.\n\nDespite that they are flying mobs, allays can destroy turtle eggs when on top of them.\n\n[10] An allay holding an item.\n\nAn allay idling.\n\nAn allay flying.\n\nAn allay flying in a different angle.\n\nAn allay dancing.\n\nAn allay

mob found in desert villages that can be saddled and ridden by up to two players at once.\n\nA camel is tall enough that its riders cannot be reached from the ground by a few melee-attacking harmful mobs, who do not attack the camel.\n\nA camel spawns in the center of each desert village during world generation.\n\nThey do not respawn if they are killed.\n\n1\u20133 experience orbs drop when camels are killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nA saddle is dropped if the camel was already equipped with one.\n\nUpon successful breeding, 1\u20137 is dropped.\n\nKilling a baby camel yields neither items nor experience.\n\nA camel wanders aimlessly, avoiding hazards and obstacles or it sits for two to seven seconds, before eventually getting up.\n\nCamels immediately get up and flee after being harmed.\n\nA seated camel cannot be pushed by players or mobs.\n\n[1] Sitting camels do not stand up if there are solid blocks above them, as doing so would cause them to take suffocation damage immediately after.\n\nCamels are healed by 2 health points each time they are fed a cactus.\n\nCamels also heal on their own over time slowly.\n\nDespite the fact they are bred with cacti, touching a cactus block still harms camels like any other mob.\n\nA camel sitting in a desert village.\n\nCamels have the unique ability to step up 1.5 block-high walls, unlike other mounts such as horses, which can automatically step up one block without jumping.\n\nThis allows camels to step onto fences and walls, among other things.\n\nMain article: Riding Camels can be ridden by players.\n\nUp to two players can ride one camel.\n\nWhile riding, the player in the back seat cannot hurt the player driving or the camel itself.\n\nCamels have one slot in their inventory, to put a Saddle on it.\n\nA saddle can be placed on a camel by holding it and then using it on the camel, or by accessing its inventory.\n\nA camel's inventory can be accessed by mounting the camel and using inventory control, or by sneaking and then using or pressing the \"open inventory\" button [Bedrock Edition only ] on the camel.\n\nOnce a camel is saddled, the player can control it with standard directional controls, jump, and the mouse.\n\nThe player dismounts using the dismount control.\n\nLike riding other entities, it is impossible for a player to use a nether portal or end portal while on a camel.\n\nCamels cannot float on water when being controlled by a player.\n\nThey can be ridden in water up to 3 blocks deep.\n\nIn deeper water, the player is automatically dismounted.\n\n[2] Several husks trying to attack Efe.\n\nCamels walk slowly and can sprint.\n\nSaddled camels also have the ability of \"dashing charging\".\n\nWhen the player rides them, the experience bar on HUD is replaced by a dash charging bar.\n\nDashing is done using the jump control, and holding the control charges for a longer dashing.\n\nCamels can dash every 2.75 seconds.\n\nWhen dashing, the camel launches up to 12 blocks forward and one block upward.\n\nFor a short time after dashing, the camel cannot sprint.\n\nCamels are tall enough that most melee hostile mobs such as zombies, vindicators, hoglins, silverfish, endermites and golden sword -wielding piglins cannot reach players to attack them.\n\nSpiders, wolves, slimes and magma cubes can attack because they jump or climb while attacking.\n\nMost mobs never deliberately attack camels under any circumstance, even to reach players riding one; the only exceptions are mobs that attack all other mobs, these being zoglins and vindicators named \"Johnny\".\n\nMain article: Breeding A camel follows the player who holds a cactus but stops following the player if it is separated from the player by at least 10 blocks [Java Edition only ] / 16 blocks [Bedrock Edition only ].\n\nSitting camels do not follow the player.\n\nAdult camels enter love mode and breed to create baby camels after they are each given a cactus.\n\nThe parents have a cooldown of five minutes before they can breed again.\n\nThe growth time that baby camels take to be an adult camel can be reduced by giving the baby camel cactus.\n\nJava Edition: Camels use the

One untamed black cat generates alongside a witch inside swamp huts upon world generation.\n\nThis cat never despawns.\n\nAdditional cats can spawn within the hut similarly to witches; for this to happen, there must be grass blocks present inside the bounding box of the swamp hut.\n\nIn Java Edition, any other cats to spawn within the swamp hut (from spawn eggs and commands without cat type set) always spawn as black.\n\nA new cat does not spawn in a hut if there is already a cat within a 16\u00d78\u00d716 block volume. [Java Edition only ] [verify ] 25% of cats spawn as kittens.\n\nDuring a full moon, 50% of cats that spawn are black.\n\nAdult cats drop: 0\u20132 string.\n\nThis drop is not affected by Looting.\n\n[1] 1\u20133 when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nUpon successful breeding, 1\u20137 is dropped.\n\nLike other baby animals, killing a kitten yields no item or experience.\n\nThis page would benefit from the addition of more images.\n\nPlease remove this notice once you've added suitable images to the article.\n\nThe specific instructions are: Baby Siamese during 21w11a.\n\n11 cat variants (from left to right): Tabby, Black, White, Persian, Ragdoll, Calico, Siamese, Red, Tuxedo, Jellie and British shorthair.\n\nThe unused tamed gray tabby texture in Bedrock Edition.\n\n[2] Baby version.\n\nDespite sharing the same model, cats are smaller than ocelots.\n\nThere are currently 11 skins that cats can have.\n\nOne of the cat skins was designed after Jellie, the late cat of YouTuber GoodTimesWithScar, and was chosen by the community in a Twitter vote.\n\n[3] The current skins are: Black (black with orange eyes) British Shorthair (silver with yellow eyes) Calico (orange, white and dark brown with yellow and blue eyes) Jellie (gray and white with gray-green eyes) Persian (creamy with blue eyes and flat faces) Ragdoll (white and soft amber with blue eyes) Red (orange and white with green eyes) Siamese (white and pale brown with blue eyes) Tabby (brown and white with yellow eyes) Tuxedo (black and white with green eyes) White (white with light blue and yellow eyes) In the default resource pack, a texture file for a tamed gray tabby exists. [BE only ] [2] It is however completely unused and cannot be spawned in-game.\n\nLike tamed wolves, tamed cats also have a collar on their necks.\n\nThe color of the cat's collar is red when tamed and can be changed by using dyes.\n\nCats are immune to fall damage, but they still avoid falling off cliffs high enough to normally cause fall damage.\n\nCats can see players even if they have the Invisibility status effect.\n\nWith the exception of a faster movement rate, kittens have the same behavior as adults.\n\nThey hiss at phantoms that are currently pursuing a player. [JE only ] Creepers and phantoms avoid cats, even while pursuing a player, keeping a distance of 6 and 16 blocks away respectively from any cats.\n\nHowever, a creeper that has begun its detonation does not flee unless the player leaves its blast radius.\n\nA stray cat is an untamed cat.\n\nNaturally spawned cats always spawn as stray cats.\n\nUnlike untamed wolves, stray cats may despawn naturally.\n\nThey pursue and attack rabbits and baby turtles up to a distance of 15 blocks.\n\nEven though they spawn in villages, they don't necessarily remain there; instead, they explore.\n\nThey sprint away from any player within 7 blocks (unless the player is sneaking [BE only ] or difficulty is set to peaceful [JE only ]), and avoid players within 16 blocks.\n\nHowever, they slowly approach a player holding raw cod or salmon within 10 blocks, allowing the player to feed and tame it (see \u00a7 Taming below).\n\nIf the player turns too quickly or stops holding the fish within 6 blocks, the cat flees and does not attempt to approach the player for a few seconds.\n\nStray cats can be leashed.\n\nCats sitting on a lime bed.\n\nUnless commanded to sit (see Taming below), tamed cats do not remain still for long and explore around the player.\n\nA cat not already sitting attempts to get on top of chests, the foot part of beds, or active furnaces at the cat's current Y-level within a 4-block-radius square horizontally, and once on top often assumes a sitting position without a command from the player.\n\nA cat also occasionally attempts to sit on these blocks if the blocks are at ground level.\n\nA chest with a cat sitting on top of it becomes unusable unless the cat is commanded to stand.\n\nCats that sit on their own can be ordered to stand, or they may get up if the player holds a raw fish nearby.\n\nThe cat can also be brought down by removing the block or pushing it off.\n\nA cat can also be forcibly moved by attacking it.\n\nA cat does not sit on a block that is obstructed by another block above it.\n\nLike other mobs, cats enter nearby boats, trapping themselves.\n\nIf a player is harmed by a hostile mob or a harming potion, but not by environmental damage, a cat sitting in proximity to the player stands, moves a few blocks from its sitting location and then resumes sitting.\n\nWhen the player sleeps, tamed cats move toward their owner and sleep near them.\n\nWhen the player wakes, their tamed cats also wake.\n\nThere is a 70% chance for a tamed cat to give the player a gift after they wake up, but only if the player sleeps at night (if the player sleeps during a thunderstorm during the daytime, or if the tamed cat has been ordered to sit, the player receives no gift).\n\nThe gift is a dropped item from the cat_morning_gift.json loot table: After a cat gives a gift, both the cat and the gift are located in the general area of the bed the player slept on, including on the other side of walls or floors.\n\nIf a player has multiple standing tamed cats in the area, only the tamed cat that sleeps on the player may provide a gift.\n\nIf all standing tamed cats in the area are prevented from reaching the player (i.e.\n\ntrapped in minecarts or boats), then in Java Edition each cat has a 70% chance of providing a gift while in Bedrock Edition only one cat may give a gift.\n\nTamed cats teleport to the player if they are more than 12 blocks from the player, except where listed below.\n\nIt is possible for a tamed cat to teleport to an inaccessible location (e.g.\n\nunder ice) and be injured or suffocate of various causes as a result.\n\nA cat does not teleport: If the cat has been ordered to sit.\n\nException: The cat is likely to teleport if it is injured while sitting (it does not sit after it teleports).\n\nA dramatic example is if a cat sitting outside is struck by lightning, in which case the cat materializes on fire.\n\nThis kills the cat.\n\nException: If a kitten is told to sit, and grows up while the chunk it is sitting in is still loaded, it teleports to the player and materializes still sitting.\n\nIf the cat is attempting to sit on a chest, bed, or furnace.\n\n [Bedrock Edition only ] If the cat is attempting to lay or is laying on a bed.\n\nIf the cat is in a minecart or boat.\n\nIf the cat has been attached to a fence post with a lead.\n\nIf the cat is in an unloaded chunk.\n\nIf none of the blocks on the edge of a 5\u00d75\u00d71 region centered on the player are transparent blocks with an opaque block below and another transparent block above.\n\nIf the player is in another dimension.\n\nIf the player is in water: The cat teleports to the player when the player leaves the water.\n\nIf the cat is in water: teleportation is unreliable.\n\nIt may or may not occur.\n\nCat teleportation is completely silent.\n\n[4] A sitting tamed black cat.\n\nStray cats can be tamed using raw cod or raw salmon (see #Behavior for how to approach a cat).\n\nOnce tamed, cats follow the player who tamed them.\n\nThey do not despawn, no longer fear the player and purr or meow frequently.\n\nLike wolves, and with the same limits, they can teleport to a player who moves 12 blocks away.\n\nThe player can order a cat to sit/stand by pressing use on it.\n\nIf the player is holding a raw cod or salmon when commanding a cat to sit or stand, the fish is given to the cat instead, causing it to enter love mode.\n\nOnce in love mode, the player can command a cat to sit or stand while holding a fish.\n\nCats also sit on certain things of their own accord (see #Tamed cat).\n\nMain article: Breeding Two cats with a newly bred kitten.\n\nWhen tamed cats are fed a raw cod or salmon, they enter love mode.\n\nBreeding creates a kitten, and the parents cannot breed again for 5 minutes.\n\nThe kitten has the coloring of and belongs to the owner of one of the parents.\n\nTwo sitting cats are unable to breed, but a mobile cat can breed with a sitting cat, in which case the mobile cat's owner also owns the kitten.\n\nThe 20 minute growth of kittens can be reduced using raw cod or salmon.\n\nEach fish reduces the growth time remaining by 10%.\n\nFeeding an injured tamed cat an uncooked cod or salmon restores its health by 2.\n\nUnlike tamed wolves, a tamed cat's tail is not an indicator of its health.\n\nJava Edition: Cats use the Friendly Creatures sound category

2014.\n\n[11] The Jellie cat was based on GoodTimesWithScar's pet cat, Jellie, who passed away on January 4th, 2024.\n\n[12] In MINECON Earth 2018, Jeb announced that the community could vote for a 9th cat skin to be added with the rest of the other 8 cat skins.\n\nAs a result, YouTuber GoodTimesWithScar\u2019s cat Jellie won the contest and was added in Village and Pillage, making the second mob variation that was suggested by the community, the first being \"Toast\", a rabbit skin added as a tribute to a user's deceased pet rabbit.\n\nBoth calico and white cats appear to have heterochromia, which is an uncommon feature in cats making both their eyes different colours.\n\nThe calico cat skin's fur pattern resembles that of Winslow, from Minecraft: Story Mode, with the only differences being the eye color and the mirrored fur pattern.\n\nThe episode in which the cat appears was released two years before calico cats were added to the game.\n\nIn real life, cats have been known for their ability to flip upright during a fall, particularly larger ones; though they still might be injured by landing.\n\nThis fact is reflected in Minecraft because they aren't damaged by falls.\n\nThe current Siamese cat texture is unused in Bedrock Edition.\n\nIn real life, calico cats are almost always female and the few male calicos that do occur are generally sterile.\n\nHowever, since animals in Minecraft are genderless, it isn't odd to breed two calico cats with each other.\n\nPersian cats in-game is the only cat variant that don't have snouts, based on their real-life variant.\n\nThe white cat in-game could be percieved as being a Khao Manee breed, due to their fur is all-white, and all white cats have heterochromia, as with most Khao Manee cats do.\n\nTabby Cat

Width: 0.6 Blocks Baby: Height: 0.4 Blocks Width: 0.3 Blocks The chicken is a passive mob found in grass biomes and the main source of raw chicken, feathers, and eggs.\n\nA chicken, like most animals, can be attached to a lead.\n\nChickens spawn naturally in the Overworld in groups of four above grass blocks with two blocks of free space above it at a light level of nine or more.\n\nChickens do not spawn in deserts, snowy plains, ice spikes, snowy slopes, meadows, wooded badlands, jagged peaks, frozen peaks and stony peaks.\n\nIn Java Edition, chickens are more common in sparse jungles.\n\nChickens spawn individually after the world generation and 5% of chickens spawn as baby chickens.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, chickens require a light level of 7 or more to spawn and spawn in groups of two to four during the world generation.\n\nMain article: Chicken Jockey All baby zombie variants and baby zombified piglins have a 5% chance to spawn riding a chicken, forming a chicken jockey.\n\nBecause a baby zombie occurs from 5% of zombie spawns, the chicken jockey spawns consist of 0.25% of all zombie spawns in a chicken-free environment; if chickens are present, the chance increases to 0.4875%.\n\nA chicken jockey can also be spawned by using the following command: / summon minecraft:chicken ~ ~ ~ {IsChickenJockey:1b,Passengers:[{id:\"minecraft:zombie\",IsBaby:1b}]} Chicken jockeys may spawn with items equipped.\n\nBaby zombified piglin versions of the chicken jockey always wield a golden sword.\n\nHarming or killing the chicken does not cause the zombified piglin to attack.\n\nChickens spawn in the Nether in this way.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, baby zombie jockeys do not spawn riding chickens, but check for nearby adult chickens to mount prior to attacking the player, a wandering trader, an adult villager, a snow golem or an iron golem.\n\nMain article: Tutorials/Chicken farming Adult chickens that were not part of chicken jockeys lay an egg every five to ten minutes.\n\nWhen an adult chicken is killed, it drops from zero to two feathers.\n\nThe maximum is increased by one per level of Looting, for a maximum of zero to five with Looting III.\n\nThe chicken also drops a raw chicken or one cooked chicken (if it is killed while on fire).\n\nThe maximum is increased by one per level of Looting, for a maximum of one to four with Looting III.\n\nFrom one to three experience orbs are dropped when the chicken is killed by the player or a tamed wolf or ten experience orbs if it was part of a chicken jockey.\n\nWhen two adult chickens breed, from one to seven experience orbs are dropped.\n\nKilling a baby chicken yields no items or experience.\n\nA chicken wanders aimlessly but go after players holding various seeds within a six by four by six cubic area, while a baby chicken follows adult chickens.\n\nChickens uniquely attempt to jump up to climb stairs instead of climbing them normally.\n\n[1] Chickens avoid falling off cliffs and flap their wings when they are in mid air and fall slowly, thus they are immune to fall damage.\n\nWhen harmed, chickens flee around for a two seconds.\n\nOcelots and foxes pursue and attack chickens.\n\nWhile in a loaded chunk, an adult chicken lays an egg every five to ten minutes (from 6000 to 12000 in-game ticks), unless it is or was, a part of a chicken jockey.\n\nIf the player is close enough to a chicken when it lays an egg, an indicative sound is heard.\n\nChickens stay underwater for 15 seconds or can swim, visibly flapping their wings and staying on the water surface.\n\nWhile swimming, a chicken needs only one block of air above its head.\n\nA chicken is 11 pixels or 0.6875 blocks tall.\n\nA baby chicken is 5.5 pixels tall or 0.34375 blocks tall.\n\nMain article: Breeding If two adult chickens are fed wheat seeds, beetroot seeds, melon seeds, pumpkin seeds, torchflower seeds or a pitcher pod, a baby chicken spawns.\n\nThe adult chickens cannot breed for five minutes afterward.\n\nSome chickens going after a player holding wheat seeds.\n\nA baby chicken with its parents.\n\nBaby chickens take 20 minutes to grow up, but the growth time can be accelerated by 10% each time it is fed seeds.\n\nA baby chicken fed a seed once per second will grow up in approximately 48 seconds using 47 seeds.\n\nA baby chicken fed a seed once per ticks will grow up in approximately three seconds using 56 seeds.\n\nBaby chickens are smaller than a half-block and can unwillingly pass through openings smaller than a full block, but do not walk through half-block-tall spaces.\n\nA baby chicken riding a minecart cannot be hit because it is completely inside the minecart's hitbox.\n\nMain article: Tutorials/Egg farming Chickens are an Overworld mob that can repopulate without breeding.\n\nAdult chickens lay eggs at random and an egg thrown at the ground by a player or a dispenser has a 1 \u2044 8 chance of spawning a baby chicken.\n\nIf a baby chicken spawns from a thrown egg, there is a further 1 \u2044 32 chance to spawn three extra baby chickens or 1 \u2044 256 overall.\n\nIt is theoretically possible for a stack of 16 eggs to yield 64 chickens if all spawn chances succeed for all eggs.\n\nIf the player throws an egg at a glass pane, the baby chicken can spawn on the far side of the pane.\n\nAs chickens can produce each other with eggs, they're perhaps the only passive mob you can farm with just a single individual, if you're willing to wait patiently and constantly throw eggs.\n\nJava Edition: Chickens use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Chickens have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Additional fields for mobs that can breed Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs EggLayTime: Number of ticks until the chicken lays its egg.\n\nLaying occurs at 0 and this timer gets reset to a new random value between 6000 and 12000.\n\nIsChickenJockey: 1 or 0 (true/false) - Whether or not the chicken is a jockey for a baby zombie.\n\nIf true, the chicken can naturally despawn, drops 10 experience upon death instead of 1-3 and cannot lay eggs.\n\nBaby zombies can still control a ridden chicken even if this is set false.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nWhen a chicken is killed off a ledge, the corpse also falls more slowly than normal and the wings continue flapping.\n\nChickens are able to \"hide\" within hoppers due to their small size, which protects them from dangers like lava on top of the hopper.\n\nA few weeks before the end of Java Edition Beta, Notch tweeted that he changed the chickens to ducks, [4] causing a turmoil on Twitter.\n\nA few days later, Jeb, still getting feedback on the idea, stated that it was just a joke.\n\n[5] The

also be used to climb hills and jump fences, which the player can't generally.\n\nDonkeys cannot float on water when being controlled by a player.\n\nThey can be ridden in water up to 2 blocks deep.\n\nIn deeper water, the player is automatically dismounted.\n\n[3] Donkeys can be equipped with chests and used as pack animals.\n\nThey can also be pulled along and tied up using a lead.\n\nGUI of a donkey, when equipped with a chest.\n\nTamed donkeys can have the following slot available: Saddle Slot: For equipping a saddle.\n\nAn additional 15 inventory slots, provided the donkey has been equipped with a chest.\n\nEquipment can be placed on a donkey by holding left shift and then using on the donkey, or by accessing its inventory.\n\nA donkey\u2019s inventory can be accessed by mounting the donkey and using inventory control, or by sneaking and then using or pressing the \"open inventory\" button [Bedrock Edition only ] on the donkey.\n\nA donkey can be equipped with a chest by using a chest on a donkey.\n\nThe chest cannot be removed except by killing the donkey, which causes the chest and its contents to drop.\n\nFoals cannot be equipped with anything.\n\nMain article: Riding Once a donkey is tamed and saddled, the player can control it with the standard directional controls, jump, and the mouse.\n\nThe player dismounts using the dismount control.\n\nLike riding other entities, it is impossible for a player to use a nether portal or end portal while on a donkey.\n\nA ridden saddled donkey automatically runs up any one block high slope.\n\nThe donkey and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high.\n\nLower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block.\n\nThe donkey itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks.\n\nThey cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.\n\nUnlike horses, all spawned donkeys have the same movement speed and jump strength, although speed potions can be used on the donkey and travel via the Nether can make the donkey easily the pack animal with the fastest practical way to travel in Minecraft.\n\nDonkeys are slow-moving backward, and about as fast as the player when moving sideways.\n\nRidden saddled donkeys have the ability of \"jumping charging\".\n\nWhen the player rides them, the experience bar on HUD is replaced by jumping charging bar.\n\nA ridden saddled donkey can be made to jump and holding the control charges for a higher leap.\n\nDonkeys are not affected by jump boost beacons or potions.\n\nDonkeys roam around idly, occasionally stopping to rear, swish their tails, or lower their heads as though eating the grass.\n\nUnlike sheep, the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed.\n\nA donkey may turn to look at a player who comes near.\n\nAny donkey, even a wild one, allows itself to be attached to a lead without protest.\n\nHowever, if the player attempts to saddle an untamed donkey, it rears and flails its front hooves.\n\nDonkeys remain passive, even when hit.\n\nDonkeys occasionally emit an audible braying sound.\n\nAdult Donkeys, unlike most mobs, cannot ride in a minecart and boat.\n\nFoals, however, can.\n\nUnlike other passive mobs, donkeys slowly regenerate health.\n\nAdult donkeys can be tamed.\n\nWith an empty hand, mount it repeatedly; when it shows hearts and no longer bucks the player, it is tamed.\n\nIt is necessary to tame a donkey in order to breed it, give it equipment, or ride it for any length of time.\n\nTaming depends on the donkey's \"temper\".\n\nThey begin with a temper of 0 out of 100.\n\nWhen a player is riding the donkey, a random number between 0 and 99 is chosen.\n\nThe donkey becomes tame if this number is less than the temper, otherwise, the temper is increased by 5 and the player is bucked off.\n\nTemper can also be increased by feeding the donkey.\n\nWhile riding an untamed donkey, a galloping sound is audible, more or less rapid.\n\nThis gives a general idea of the donkey's speed.\n\nIt is unknown whether there is any indication of jump height before taming.\n\nLike all tamed animals, a death message is displayed to their owner if they are killed. [Bedrock Edition only ] Feeding tamed donkeys golden apples or golden carrots activates love mode.\n\nThe offspring appear more spindly than their adult versions and grow progressively larger with time until they reach their full size.\n\nThe offspring do not automatically belong to the player who owns their parents.\n\nRather, it is born as an untamed donkey and must be tamed after it grows into an adult.\n\nThe foal can be fed to make it mature faster.\n\nBreeding two donkeys creates a donkey foal.\n\nBecause all donkeys have the same texture, the offspring looks exactly like its parents when it is fully grown.\n\nCross-breeding a donkey with a horse creates a mule foal.\n\nMules cannot breed.\n\nFeeding a donkey food may alter its behavior and cause it to grow (if it is not yet an adult; foals normally take 20 minutes to fully mature if not fed), and restore its health.\n\nTo feed a donkey, hold a valid food item and press use while looking at it.\n\nIf the food is invalid, the action is treated as an attempt to mount the donkey.\n\nDonkeys can be fed only when feeding would have an effect, similar to other animals.\n\nThe table below lists the effects of the various foods donkeys can consume.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Horses All donkeys have three \"equine stats\" that vary between donkeys: health, (maximum) movement speed, and jump strength.\n\nThese stats are created once the donkey is born or spawned, and are not affected by food.\n\nWhen spawned in any way except breeding \u2013 for instance, using commands, spawning naturally, spawning as part of a skeleton trap, or using spawn eggs \u2013 donkeys are assigned their stats within certain ranges, specific according to their horse type.\n\nDonkey's health ranges from 15\u201330, but tends toward the average 22\u201323.\n\nDisplayed hearts are health, divided by two, rounded down.\n\nA donkey with an odd number of health points (15, 17, 19, etc.) does not display the last half-heart.\n\nIf the donkey has lost one fewer health point than the inflicted damage and did not regenerate, it has an odd number of health points, otherwise, it has an even number of health points.\n\nA spawned donkey's speed value is always 0.175, but it only moves at the slightly reduced 7.38 blocks/sec.\n\nFor reference, the player's normal walking speed is 0.1, equivalent to 4.3 blocks/sec.\n\nand the player's sprinting speed is equivalent to 5.6 blocks/sec.\n\nThe speed listed does not include any status effect that affects the speed of a horse or a player.\n\nA bred donkey's speed value has the same limits as other horses, between 0.1125 and 0.3375.\n\nSee Horse#Movement speed.\n\nSee transportation to compare the speeds of various transportation methods.\n\nA spawned donkey's jump strength is always 0.5, enough to clear 1 9 \u2044 16 blocks.\n\nA bred donkey's jump strength has the same limits as other horses, between 0.4 and 1.0.\n\nSee Tutorials/Horses#Speed.\n\nWhen breeding two donkeys, the foal's stats are determined by a variation of the average of both parents' stats, randomly determined the same way horses' stats are.\n\nJava Edition: Donkeys use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b c MC-98316 \u2014 Wrong subtitles caused by missing distinction Bedrock Edition: \u2191 a b These sound events are assigned to the donkey, but are not called by the game \u2191 Except for stems, Nether wood, cherry wood, and bamboo wood due to MCPE-165012 Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Donkeys have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Additional fields for mobs that can breed Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Tags common to all horses ChestedHorse: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the horse has chests.\n\nA chested horse that is not a donkey or a mule crashes the game.\n\nItems: List of items.\n\nOnly exists if ChestedHorse is true.\n\nAn item, including the Slot tag.\n\nSlots are numbered 2 to 16 for donkeys and mules, and none exist for all other horses.\n\nTags common to all items Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Donkey\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nIf a player picks up leather dropped by an adult donkey, they receive the \" Cow Tipper \" achievement.\n\nThis is due to the achievement being given when a player picks up any piece of leather instead of being given when killing a cow.\n\nA player riding a donkey is dragged along if the donkey is being pulled by a lead, and can even be lifted up in the air in the same way.\n\nUsing commands, it is possible to make a donkey with no armor slot, but also no way to equip a chest.\n\nIn the Bedrock Edition, the donkey can be transported in a boat by riding the donkey and jumping into the boat then dismounting (leaving the donkey behind in the boat) and activating the boat from underneath/underwater.\n\nAttempting to activate the boat to pilot it from above results in the player being mounted on the donkey again rather than being placed inside the boat to pilot it.\n\nThe first image of the donkey chest inventory.\n\n[5] A donkey and a mule.\n\nA herd of donkeys and horses spawned next to each other.\n\nLEGO Minecraft Donkey.\n\nHorse Zombie Horse Skeleton Horse Mule Llama \u2191 MCPE-118688 \u2191 MC-13738 \u2191 MC-72440 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 \" Also big thanks to @DrZhark, the creator of Mo' Creatures, that have assisted us to make it happen!\" \u2013 @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X, April 4, 2013 \u2191 \" Do not look at this image.\" \u2013 @Dinnerbone (Nathan Adams) on X, May 10, 2013 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

three of them generate in each one.\n\nThree elder guardians spawn naturally during the generation of each ocean monument: one in the top room of the monument and the other two in each wing section of the monument.\n\nThey do not respawn after their initial spawn, thus there are a limited number of them per world.\n\nHowever, they may be squished to death for some reasons, reducing the number available on the monument Elder guardians drop the following items: 0\u20132 prismarine shard s \u2013 always.\n\nAffected by Looting: 1 more drop per level, for a maximum of 5.\n\n1 wet sponge \u2013 when killed by the player.\n\nNot affected by Looting.\n\n20% chance to drop a tide armor trim smithing template, unaffected by Looting.\n\nOne of the following: 1 \u2044 2 chance: a raw cod (cooked cod if killed by fire [JE only ]).\n\nAffected by Looting: 0\u20131 more drops per level, for a maximum of 4.\n\n1 \u2044 3 chance: prismarine crystals.\n\nAffected by Looting: 0\u20131 more drops per level, for a maximum of 4.\n\n1 \u2044 6 chance: no drop.\n\n2.5% chance: a random fish.\n\nAffected by Looting: 1% more chance per level, for a maximum of 5.5% with Looting III.\n\nThis drop uses the same chances that fishing uses, resulting in a 60% chance for raw cod, a 25% chance for raw salmon, a 13% chance for pufferfish, and a 2% chance for tropical fish.\n\n10 \u2013 when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nThis section would benefit from the addition of more images.\n\nPlease remove this notice once you've added suitable images to the article.\n\nThe specific instructions are: Animated images of the elder guardian cursing effect, distinct ones for java and bedrock due to animation differences Elder guardians do not swim around as much as normal guardians.\n\nElder guardians do not swim away when approached by a player it is targeting, unlike regular guardians.\n\nLike normal guardians, elder guardians attempt to attack both the player and squid.\n\nThe elder guardian's eye follows and stares at any nearby players, and always looks directly at its target.\n\nThe eye still follows a player under the effects of Invisibility or in Spectator mode, but doesn't attack.\n\nElder guardian are considered aquatic mobs, and thus are affected by the Impaling enchantment.\n\n [Java Edition only ]  [until JE Combat Tests ] The elder guardian has three methods of attacking, including firing its laser, inflicting Mining Fatigue, and a defensive thorn-like attack.\n\nThe elder guardian pathfinds toward an ocean monument if it is not within one.\n\nAn elder guardian attacks axolotls that are not playing dead.\n\nOtherwise, an elder guardian does not attack mobs (such as iron golems) that attack it, although the attacking mob takes damage from the elder guardian's natural spikes defense.\n\nLaser The laser takes several seconds to charge, doing no damage and allowing the player to move away in the meantime.\n\nAs it charges it turns from purple to bright yellow (thus acting as a warning indicator).\n\nOnce charged, the beam flashes green, abruptly ends, and deals 12 \u00d7 6 damage on Hard difficulty.\n\nThe elder guardian swims around for a few seconds before firing again.\n\nThe beam cannot be dodged and has a maximum range of approximately 14 blocks.\n\nOnce the player is out of range, if the beam is obstructed by solid blocks, or if the player has a shield, the guardian's beam disengages from the player and deals no damage.\n\n[more information needed ] In Java Edition, immediately after spawning and once each minute thereafter, the elder guardian searches for any player within a spherical radius of 50 blocks to afflict with Mining Fatigue III.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition the elder guardian inflicts any unafflicted player within range immediately.\n\nWhen afflicted, the player sees a ghostly image of the elder guardian and hears a ghostly noise.\n\nThe effect decreases a player's attack speed by 30% and decreases mining speed even more for 5 minutes.\n\nThe attack targets players through blocks, even underground, and a potion of Invisibility offers no defense.\n\nThis is not considered an attack in regards to the Thorns enchantment.\n\nThe image of the elder guardian is a particle effect that can be recreated by issuing the command / particle minecraft:elder_guardian. [Java Edition only ] An elder guardian deals 2 (3 on Hard mode) of damage every time it is hit while its spikes are extended, similar to the Thorns enchantment on armor.\n\nIf cornered by a player or axolotl, the elder guardian usually extends its spikes and fires at point-blank range.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition.\n\nThe elder guardian ghost flying.\n\nThe elder guardian ghost is an unused mob added in beta 1.13.0.4.\n\nIts file isn't included in the behavior pack, and it can be spawned only by using the command / summon elder_guardian_ghost ~ ~ ~.\n\nThe elder guardian ghost has defensive spikes.\n\nThe elder guardian ghost has the same model and texture as the elder guardian, but uses the player hurt sound, has less health, and is missing the back tail model.\n\nWhen spawned outside of water, it floats upward until it despawns, similar to a mob tied to a balloon, or under a high level of levitation effect, but it passes through blocks.\n\nThe elder guardian ghost itself isn't immune to suffocation damage, and drops only experience.\n\nIt behaves similar to custom mobs added in behavior packs with broken AI; the mobs float upward and pass through blocks when hit.\n\nIf an elder guardian ghost is spawned underwater, it slowly sinks downward, passing through all blocks (including bedrock), until it eventually it falls into the void and dies.\n\nWhen underwater, the elder guardian ghost can rotate its body, look at players, and swim while slowly sinking downward.\n\nJava Edition: Elder guardians use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 Increases quadratically from minimum to maximum as the attack goes on \u2191 Increases linearly from minimum to maximum as the attack goes on Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Elder guardians have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Elder Guardian\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe elder guardian's eye is the \"head\" part of the mob 's model, giving the illusion of a dynamic eye.\n\nThe elder guardian texture has the name \"jeb\" on it.\n\nAccording to Jeb, elder guardians were introduced to encourage players to solve the temple maze rather than dig through it easily.\n\nHe acknowledges there are ways around it, but players still have to solve the challenge in a different way.\n\n[4] Also according to Jeb, the \"jump scare\" by an elder guardian is unintentional, instead, he added it to provide a visual cue as to why players get slowed down by Mining Fatigue.\n\n[4] In Java Edition 3D Shareware v1.34, elder guardians drop blue keys.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, elder guardians make their underwater death sounds if killed on land.\n\nThey also, like guardians, don't make flopping sounds on Bedrock Edition.\n\nThe elder guardian was once referred to as a \u201cboss\u201d by Mojang.\n\nThis means depending on how you see it, it could be the third boss as well as the two official bosses.\n\nA special effect of the elder guardian, which gives Mining Fatigue III for 5 minutes.\n\nThe elder guardian's Mining Fatigue effect.\n\nAn elder guardian spawned inside an ocean monument.\n\nAn elder guardian spreading its spikes.\n\nAn elder guardian's laser.\n\nAn elder guardian in full view.\n\nThe inside of an elder guardian (spikes retracted).\n\nSize comparison between an elder and a normal guardian.\n\nThe elder guardian curse ghastly image shows the elder guardian's full model.\n\nA group of axolotls attacking an elder guardian.\n\nA player avoiding an elder guardian by using the Invisibility effect.\n\nA player avoiding an elder guardian by using the Invisibility effect.\n\nAn elder guardian in promotional artwork for the Boss Update.\n\nMinecraft Mobestiary 's page about elder guardians.\n\nLego Minecraft elder guardian.\n\nNarrator and MARILLA attempting to battle an Elder Guardian.\n\n\u2191 MC-57057 \u2014 Guardian laser attack sound ignores distance \u2191 MC-92294 \u2191 http://www.mojang.com/2016/08/sneak-peek-boss-update-is-coming-to-pocket-and-windows-10/ [dead link ] \u2191 a b https://minecraft.net/en-us/article/block-week-prismarine Meet the Elder Guardian \u2013 Minecraft.net on November 6, 2017 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

frog is a passive mob found in swamps.\n\nFrogs eat small slimes and magma cubes.\n\nA frog can produce one of three kinds of froglights from eating magma cubes, depending on the type of frog.\n\nGroups of two to five frogs can spawn in swamp and mangrove swamp biomes.\n\nFrogs can also be spawned by growing from tadpoles.\n\nThere are three frog variants, determined by the biome in which the tadpole grew up: Notes \u2191 a b Frogs spawn naturally in this biome.\n\nFrogs drop 1\u20133 when killed by a player or tamed wolf, while 1\u20137 is dropped upon successful breeding.\n\nOn land, frogs will slowly wander, jumping at random.\n\nThey can jump 8 blocks high and take 5 less damage from falling than most other mobs.\n\nThey prefer jumping on lily pads and big dripleaves, and will usually jump to blocks that are higher up.\n\nIn water, frogs move much faster.\n\nThey will generally swim upwards and remain at the water's surface, but will swim downwards if lured by a player.\n\nFrogs cannot be hurt by drowning.\n\nOccasionally, they may croak and inflate their vocal sac.\n\nMain article: Tutorials/Frog farming Frogs will follow any player holding a slimeball within 6 blocks of them.\n\nFeeding two frogs a slimeball causes them to enter love mode, causing one of the frogs to become pregnant, similar to turtles.\n\nThe pregnant frog then searches for a water block with at least one adjacent water block (flowing or source) with air above to lay frogspawn.\n\nThis spawn later hatches into tadpoles, which subsequently grow into frogs.\n\nUnlike all other mobs with baby variants, the tadpole is treated by the game as a completely different mob from the frog.\n\nFrogs attack by using their tongue to pull certain mobs into their mouth, whereupon the mob instantly despawns without a death animation.\n\nFrogs attack small slimes, which drop slimeballs when killed.\n\nFrogs also attack small magma cubes, leaving a froglight block.\n\nWhen the

frogs.\n\nInstead, now they can eat small slimes and small magma cubes.\n\n[5] During the frog's early development, the developers didn't know what the frog was going to eat, so they made the mouth huge.\n\nSome early ideas for what the frog was going to eat included bees.\n\n[6] At one point in Bedrock Edition's development, in beta 1.18.10.26, frogs could eat goats.\n\nHowever, this was later removed as it was leftover prototype code.\n\n[7] This was later referenced in the trailer for Minecraft Live 2022, where a frog eats a goat.\n\nDespite frogs only spawning in mangrove swamps and

[Java Edition only ] Guardians and elder guardians attack glow squid in the same manner as they attack a player or regular squid.\n\nAxolotls also attack glow squid.\n\nBecause glow squid are aquatic mobs, they are affected by the Impaling enchantment. [Java Edition only ]  [until JE Combat Tests ] Glow squid constantly produce crystalline particles around them.\n\nWhen attacked, they emit a cloud of turquoise ink particles and swim away.\n\nThe particles and the ink remain remain visible when the glow squid has the Invisibility status effect.\n\nIf the player is in Spectator mode or is far away from glow squid (often when they are in unloaded chunks), they remain stationary.\n\nWhen attacked in this state, glow squid cannot flee.\n\nAlthough glow squid have a baby variant in Bedrock Edition, there is no way to breed adult glow squid.\n\nJava Edition: Glow squids use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Glow squid have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs DarkTicksRemaining: Countdown of ticks remaining until the glow squid starts glowing.\n\nNot glowing while positive, glowing when countdown reaches zero.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nGlow Squid during development in Java Edition.\n\nGlow Squid during development in Java Edition.\n\nGlow Squid in Bedrock Edition beta 1.16.210.59.\n\nIssues relating to \"Glow Squid\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe glow squid won the Minecraft Live 2020 mob vote, beating the iceologer (from Minecraft Dungeons) and the moobloom (also from Minecraft Earth).\n\nMultiple glow squid.\n\nThree axolotls attacking a glow squid underwater.\n\nA deep lukewarm ocean with several glow squid clearly visible.\n\nGlow squids underwater.\n\nA screenshot of the mob vote 2020 featuring the glow squid.\n\nGlow squid won the Mob Vote 2020.\n\nAnimation of glow squid winning in mob vote 2020.\n\nGlow squid from Minecraft Plus!.\n\nA glow squid in promotional artwork for the first Caves & Cliffs update (1.17 game version).\n\nA Glow Squid in promotional artwork for Mobile, Multiplayer & More.\n\nLego Minecraft Glow Squid.\n\nA T-Shirt featuring a glow squid design.\n\nA glow in the dark Glow Squid shirt.\n\n\"Survive, Explore, Create\" a sticker design plastered on a laptop.\n\nThe same design, now on a water bottle.\n\nSquid Glow Squid (Minecraft Earth) Glow Squid (Minecraft Dungeons) Glow Squid Armor \u2191 MC-136647 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

and 1 of 5 marking patterns: no markings, stockings and blaze, paint, snowflake appaloosa and sooty.\n\nIn total, there are 35 possible horse coat combinations.\n\nUnlike almost all other mobs, horses with equipped saddles don't render these when under the effect of Invisibility.\n\n[1] Horse colors and markings Upon death, horses drop: 0\u20132 Leather.\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-5 with Looting III.\n\n1\u20133 exp.\n\nwhen killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nHorse armor if the horse was already equipped Saddle if the horse was already equipped.\n\nUpon successful breeding, 1\u20137 is dropped.\n\nKilling a foal yields neither items nor experience.\n\nSee also: Transportation Tamed and saddled horses can be used as a means of transportation in the game.\n\nWhen ridden, they are able to move faster and jump higher than a normal player.\n\nHorses can be used to climb hills and jump fences, as some can jump high enough to clear up to five block heights, versus the player's maximum of about one (without jump boost).\n\nHorses cannot float on water when being controlled by a player.\n\nThey can be ridden in water up to 2 blocks deep.\n\nIn deeper water, the player is automatically dismounted.\n\n[2] Horses can be pulled along and tied up using a lead.\n\nThey can be towed in two ways: Horses can swim behind a boat by using a lead, or a boat can be attached to a lead [Bedrock Edition only ] (before putting the horse in the boat) and the player can swim to tow the boat containing the horse.\n\nHorse UI Tamed horses have the following two slots available: Horse Armor Slot: For equipping horse armor.\n\nExclusive to horses.\n\nSaddle Slot: For equipping a saddle.\n\nFoals cannot be equipped.\n\nEquipment can be placed on a horse by holding it and then using on the horse, or by accessing its inventory.\n\nA horse\u2019s inventory can be accessed by mounting the horse and using inventory control, or by sneaking and then using or pressing the \"open inventory\" button  [Bedrock Edition only ] on the horse.\n\nA normal horse\u2019s inventory has two slots, one for a saddle and one for horse armor.\n\nMain article: Riding Once a horse is tamed and saddled, the player can control it with standard directional controls, jump, and the mouse.\n\nThe player dismounts using the dismount control.\n\nLike riding other entities, it is impossible for a player to use a nether portal or end portal while on a horse.\n\nA ridden saddled horse automatically runs up any one block high slope.\n\nThe horse and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high.\n\nLower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block.\n\nThe horse itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks.\n\nHorses cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.\n\nThe maximum speed of horses varies between 4.74 blocks/second and 14.23 blocks/second (compared to the player's walking speed, which is about 4.317 blocks/second).\n\nAbout 82% of horses are able to go faster than a minecart.\n\nHorses move backward slowly, about as fast as the player when moving sideways.\n\nA horse\u2019s speed can also be affected by potions.\n\nSpeed has no relation to a horse\u2019s outward appearance.\n\nRidden saddled horses have the ability of \"jumping charging\".\n\nWhen the player rides them, the experience bar on HUD is replaced by jumping charging bar.\n\nA ridden saddled horse can be made to jump and holding the control charges for a higher leap.\n\nHorses are not affected by jump boost beacons or potions.\n\nA horse eating grass.\n\nA horse rearing.\n\nHorses wander aimlessly, occasionally stopping to rear, flick their tails, or lower their heads as though eating the grass.\n\nUnlike sheep, the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed.\n\nIf a player comes near, the horses may turn to look at them.\n\nAny horse, even a wild or undead horse, can be attached to a lead without protest, although an untamed horse rears and flails its forelegs if saddled.\n\nHorses remain passive, even when hit.\n\nHorses make neighing and whinnying sounds.\n\nHorses, like most mobs, can ride in a minecart or a boat.\n\nAdult horses cannot ride in boats. [Java Edition only ] Unlike other passive mobs, horses slowly regenerate health.\n\nTamed (and untamed [Java Edition only ]) horses can be led by a player holding a golden carrot, golden apple, or enchanted golden apple.\n\nBaby horses follow adult horses.\n\nTaming a horse is required to breed it, to give it equipment, or to control it while riding.\n\nA player mounts a horse by pressing use on it with an empty hand, or while holding an object that cannot be used on a horse.\n\nA player tames an adult horse by repeatedly mounting it until the horse stops bucking off the player.\n\nTaming depends on the horse's \"temper\".\n\nHorses begin with a temper of 0 out of 100.\n\nWhen a player first mounts the horse, a random taming threshold 0\u201399 is chosen.\n\nThe horse becomes tame if the temper exceeds this threshold.\n\nOtherwise, the player is bucked off and the temper is increased by 5, to be compared against the threshold the next time the player mounts the horse.\n\nTemper can also be increased by feeding the horse.\n\nAfter repeated mountings, hearts appear above the horse, indicating that it is tamed.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, like all tame animals, when a horse is killed, a death message is displayed to every player.\n\nFeeding two tamed horses golden apples or golden carrots activates love mode, causing them to mate and produce a foal.\n\nThe foal appears more spindly than adult horses and grows in stages to full size with time.\n\nThe foal can be fed to make it mature faster.\n\nDepending on the variations of the parent horses, the offspring can be one of several types.\n\nBred with a horse: Breeding two horses produces a horse foal.\n\nUsually, the new foal has the color and markings of one of its parents, although there is a 13 \u2044 45 chance of having a random color/markings (which may still end up being the same as one of the parents).\n\nBred with donkey: Cross-breeding a horse with a donkey creates a mule foal.\n\nMules cannot breed.\n\nThis unlocks the Artificial Selection achievement. [Bedrock Edition only ] This is a table representing the probabilities of the color and markings of the foal when breeding two horses A and B.\n\nFeeding a horse food can alter its behavior, cause it to grow (if it is not yet an adult; foals normally take 20 minutes to fully mature if not fed), and/or restore its health.\n\nThe table below lists the effects of the various foods horses can take.\n\nZombie and skeleton horses cannot be fed, even if tamed.\n\nTo feed a horse, hold a valid food item and press use on the horse.\n\nFeeding invalid food causes the player to mount the horse.\n\nHorses can be fed only when feeding would have an effect, similar to other animals.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Horses All horses have three \"equine stats\" that vary from horse to horse: health, (maximum) movement speed, and jump height.\n\nThese stats are created once the horse is born or spawned, and are not affected by food.\n\nWhen spawned in any way except breeding \u2013 for instance, using commands, spawning naturally, spawning as part of a skeleton trap, or using spawn eggs \u2013 horses are assigned their stats within certain ranges.\n\nHorse's hearts ranges from 15\u201330, with an average of 22.5 \u00d7 11.25.\n\nDisplayed hearts are health, divided by two, rounded down.\n\nA horse with an odd number of health points (15, 17, 19, etc.) does not show the last half-heart.\n\nOne may test this by hitting a horse: if the horse has lost one-half heart from one punch, it has an even number of health points.\n\nOtherwise, odd.\n\nHorse's movement speed ranges from 0.1125\u20130.3375 in internal units, with an average of 0.225.\n\nFor reference, the player's normal walking speed is 0.1.\n\nThe speed listed does not include any status effect that affects the speed of the horse or the player.\n\nThe conversion factor between internal units and blocks/sec is roughly 43.17.\n\nHowever, horses instead travel at just shy of 42.16 blocks/sec times their internal attribute, putting the best horse's maximum speed at 14.23 blocks/second, and the average horse's speed at about 9.49 blocks/sec.\n\nMinimum: 4.85 blocks/sec.\n\nPlayer speed (walking): 4.317 blocks/sec.\n\nPlayer speed (sprinting): 5.612 blocks/sec.\n\nSee also transportation methods to compare the speeds of various transportation methods.\n\nHorse's jump strength ranges from 0.4\u20131.0, with an average of 0.7.\n\nA jump strength of 0.5 is enough to clear 1 9 \u2044 16 blocks, while 1.0 is enough to clear 5 1 \u2044 4 blocks.\n\nWhen breeding two horses, or a horse and a donkey, the foal's stats are determined by averaging both parent's stats and adding a random variation to it.\n\nThe variant of the child has an 11% chance to be a random base color, and a 20% chance to have random markings.\n\nOtherwise, it chooses the values from one of its parents.\n\nJava Edition: Horses use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 Except for stems, Nether wood, cherry wood, and bamboo wood due to MC-257246 Bedrock Edition: \u2191 This sound event is assigned to the horse for adding a chest, but is not called by the game \u2191

Height: 1.6 Blocks Width: 1.4 Blocks Baby: Height: 0.8 Blocks Width: 0.7 Blocks Mules are infertile offspring of horses and donkeys that, when tamed, can be ridden and equipped with chests.\n\nMules do not spawn naturally, but they can spawn through cross-breeding a horse with a donkey.\n\nMules cannot breed with other mules.\n\n20% of mule spawn eggs produce foals.\n\nMules are the offspring of horses and donkeys and are closer to (but not quite) the size of a normal horse.\n\nTheir ears, coats, and manes are like those of a donkey, though mules' coats are darker and reddish-brown.\n\nLike donkeys, mules cannot be equipped with armor but can be equipped with chests.\n\nMules cannot have foals, much like mules in real life.\n\nUnlike almost all other mobs, mules with equipped saddles or chests do not render them when under the effect of Invisibility.\n\n[1] Upon death, mules drop: 0\u20132 Leather.\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-5 with Looting III.\n\n1\u20133, when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nIf equipped with a chest or saddle, they drop those items, as well as any contents of the chest.\n\nSee also: Transportation Tamed and saddled mules can be used as a means of transportation in the game.\n\nMules cannot float on water when being controlled by a player.\n\nThey can be ridden in water up to 2 blocks deep.\n\nIn deeper water, the player is automatically dismounted.\n\n[2] Mules can be equipped with chests and used as pack animals.\n\nThey can be pulled along and tied up using a lead.\n\nGUI of a mule.\n\nTamed mules have the following slot available: Saddle Slot: For equipping a saddle.\n\nAn additional 15 inventory slots, provided the mule has been equipped with a chest.\n\nEquipment can be placed on a mule by holding it and then using on the mule, or by accessing its inventory.\n\nA mule\u2019s inventory can be accessed by mounting the mule and using inventory control, or by sneaking and then using or pressing the \"open inventory\" button  [Bedrock Edition only ] on the mule.\n\nA mule starts out with just a saddle slot, but if it is given a chest, it acquires 15 more inventory slots that can hold anything the player wishes.\n\nChests can be given to a mule by using it with the chest in hand, and the chest cannot be removed except by killing the mule.\n\nUpon death, the mule drops the attached chest and its contents.\n\nFoals cannot be equipped with anything.\n\nMain article: Riding Once a mule is tamed and saddled, the player can control it with standard directional controls, jump, and the mouse.\n\nThe player dismounts using the dismount control.\n\nFor a long time, it was impossible for a player to use a nether portal or end portal while on a mule, until snapshot 24w21b, when minecraft added the new \"entitiesWithPassengersCanUsePortals\" gamerule, allowing minecarts, boats, and animals like pigs or horses to be ridden through a portal A ridden saddled mule automatically runs up any one block high slope.\n\nThe mule and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high.\n\nLower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block.\n\nThe mule itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks.\n\nMules cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.\n\nThe maximum speed of mules, when created by breeding a horse and a donkey, varies between 4.8375 blocks/second and 14.5125 blocks/second (compared to the player's walking speed, which is about 4.3 blocks/second).\n\nAbout 68% of mules are able to go faster than a minecart.\n\nAny mule spawned with its spawn egg always has a speed of 7.525 blocks/second, which is slower than a minecart at full speed.\n\nMules are slow-moving backward, and about as fast as the player when moving sideways.\n\nRidden saddled mules have the ability of \"jumping charging\".\n\nWhen the player rides them, the experience bar on HUD is replaced by jumping charging bar.\n\nA ridden saddled mule can be made to jump and holding the control charges for a higher leap.\n\nMules are not affected by jump boost beacons or potions.\n\nAll mules roam idly, occasionally stopping to rear, swish their tails, or lower their heads as though eating the grass.\n\nUnlike sheep, the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed.\n\nMules turn to look at any player that comes near.\n\nAny mule, even a wild one, allows itself to be attached to a lead without protest.\n\nHowever, if the player attempts to saddle an untamed mule, it rears and flails its front hooves.\n\nMules, like most mobs, can ride in a minecart and boat.\n\nUnlike other passive mobs, mules slowly regenerate health.\n\nAdult mules can be tamed: with an empty hand, mount the mule repeatedly; when it no longer bucks the player and shows hearts, it is tamed.\n\nIt is necessary to tame a mule in order to give it equipment or ride it for any length of time.\n\nTaming depends on the mule's \"temper\".\n\nMules begin with a temper of 0 out of 100.\n\nWhen a player is riding the mule, a random number between 0 and 99 is chosen.\n\nThe mule becomes tame if this number is less than the temper, otherwise, the temper is increased by 5 and the player is bucked off.\n\nTemper can also be increased by feeding the mule.\n\nWhile riding an untamed mule, a galloping sound is audible, more or less rapid to give a general idea of the mule's speed.\n\nIt is unknown whether there is any indication of jump height before taming.\n\nLike all tamed animals, a death message is displayed to their owner if they are killed. [Bedrock Edition only ] Like their real-life counterparts, mules in Minecraft cannot produce offspring.\n\nThe only way to produce a mule (other than using a spawn egg) is to cross-breed a horse with a donkey.\n\nFeeding a mule food can alter its behavior, cause it to grow (if it is not yet an adult; foals normally take 20 minutes to fully mature if not fed), and/or restore its health.\n\nThe table below lists the effects of the various foods mules eat.\n\nTo feed a mule, hold a valid food item and press use on the mule.\n\nIf the food is invalid, the player simply mounts the mule.\n\nMules can be fed only when feeding would have an effect, similar to other animals.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Horses Mules have three \"equine stats\" that vary from mule to mule: health, (maximum) movement speed, and jump strength.\n\nThese stats are created once the mule is born or spawned, and are not affected by food.\n\nWhen spawned in any way except breeding \u2013 for instance, using commands or using spawn eggs \u2013 mules are assigned their stats within certain ranges, specific according to their horse type.\n\nA mule's health ranges from 15\u201330, but tends toward the average of 22\u201323.\n\nDisplayed hearts are health, divided by two, rounded down.\n\nA mule with a non-even number of health points (15, 17, 19, etc.) does not show the last half-heart.\n\nIf the mule has lost one fewer health point than the inflicted damage and did not regenerate, it has an odd number of health points, otherwise, it has an even number of health points.\n\nSpawned mules' speed is always 0.175; the player's normal walking speed is 0.1.\n\nThe speed listed does not include any status effect that affects the speed of a horse or a player.\n\nBred mules have speed based on their parent's speeds, like all other horse breeding.\n\nSee transportation to compare the speeds of various transportation methods.\n\nSpawned mules' jump strength is usually 0.5, which is enough to clear 1 9 \u2044 16 blocks.\n\nOther jump strengths can be found in bred mules, depending on the statistics of the parents (as explained later).\n\nWhen breeding a horse and a donkey, the foal's stats are determined by a variation of the average of both parents' stats, randomly determined as horses' stats are.\n\nJava Edition: Mules use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b c MC-98316 \u2014 Wrong subtitles caused by missing distinction Bedrock Edition: \u2191 Except for stems, Nether wood, cherry wood, and bamboo wood due to MCPE-165012 Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Mules have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Additional fields for mobs that can breed Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Tags common to all horses ChestedHorse: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the horse has chests.\n\nA chested horse that is not a donkey or a mule crashes the game.\n\nItems: List of items.\n\nOnly exists if ChestedHorse is true.\n\nAn item, including the Slot tag.\n\nSlots are numbered 2 to 16 for donkeys and mules, and none exist for all other horses.\n\nTags common to all items Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Mule\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nA \"mule\" specifically refers to the offspring of a male donkey (jack) and a female horse (mare).\n\nThe offspring of a female donkey (jenny) and a male horse (stallion) is called a \"hinny\".\n\nBecause mules are way more common than hinnies however, \"mule\" can colloquially refer to any donkey-horse hybrid.\n\nA herd of various horses and a baby mule.\n\nA donkey and a mule.\n\nHorse Donkey Skeleton Horse Zombie Horse Llama \u2191 MC-13738 \u2191 MC-72440 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 \"Also big thanks to @DrZhark, the creator of Mo' Creatures, that have assisted us to make it happen!\" \u2013 @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X, April 4, 2013 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

[Bedrock Edition only ] Unlike other fish, pufferfish don't swim in schools.\n\nLike other fish, pufferfish cannot survive out of water.\n\nOutside of water, they flop around like guardians for a while until they start suffocating, and then die like squid.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition they rotate when flopping.\n\nFish cannot swim or breathe in cauldron water.\n\n[4] All fish are vulnerable to weapons that have the Impaling enchantment, which also affects squid, turtles, guardians, elder guardians, and dolphins.\n\nA pufferfish inflates when approached by a player in Survival or Adventure mode, a drowned, an axolotl, or any non-water mob within a 5\u00d75\u00d75 volume around the fish, going from unpuffed, then semi-puffed, to fully puffed.\n\nPufferfish are technically passive mobs but going near one when semi-puffed or fully puffed inflicts the player/mob with three or six seconds of Poison based on the inflation level, and touching one in its puffed or semi-puffed form deals damage separate from the Poison.\n\nPufferfish also instantly inflate to their fullest form after taking any kind of damage. [Bedrock Edition only ] After inflating, they slowly deflate to their normal shape as long as a threat is out of range.\n\nIf the player/mob leaves the radius while the pufferfish is in its semi-puffed stage, it deflates back to normal.\n\nUndead mobs are unaffected by the Poison effect, but still, take damage when they come into contact with pufferfish.\n\nA pufferfish inflicting damage to a mob other than creeper and ghast via touching provokes that mob to retaliate.\n\nIn Peaceful difficulty, pufferfish do not inflict damage or Poison to player.

each use reduces 10% of the remaining time to grow up.\n\nDespite their hostile nature, killer bunnies can breed with other rabbits and with each other, having the unusual chance of creating a baby killer bunny.\n\nA Toast rabbit does not produce a Toast rabbit baby, however.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, baby rabbits follow their parents; this behavior is absent in Java Edition.\n\n[2] The six natural types of rabbits.\n\nRabbits typically spawn using one of six different skins.\n\nSkins include regular brown fur, white fur with red eyes (albino), black mottled fur, black and white spotted fur, gold (cream) fur, and salt and pepper fur.\n\nThe biome determines the skin used: Rabbits in snowy biomes have 80% white fur and 20% black and white fur.\n\nRabbits in deserts have 100% gold fur.\n\nRabbits in other biomes have 50% brown fur, 40% salt & pepper fur, and 10% black fur.\n\nRabbits with specific skins can be spawned using / summon rabbit ~ ~ ~ {RabbitType: (Number from 0 - 5)}  [Java Edition only ] or / summon rabbit ~ ~ ~ in_desert (gold)/in_snow (white)  [Bedrock Edition only ].\n\nWhile it is possible to go above 5, this results in rabbits with skins identical to RabbitType: 0, with the exception of RabbitType: 99, the Killer Bunny.\n\nThere are two special variants of rabbits: This feature is exclusive to Java Edition.\n\nThe current killer bunny texture The killer bunny is an aggressive variant of the rabbit exclusive to Java Edition that is hostile toward players, foxes, and wolves.\n\nIts fur is pure white with blood-red eyes that are horizontal, compared to a normal rabbit's vertical eyes.\n\nIt can be spawned only by using the / summon rabbit ~ ~ ~ {RabbitType:99} command.\n\nIt appears with a nameplate over its head reading \"The Killer Bunny\".\n\nIf the killer bunny finds any player within a 16-block radius, it hops toward the player much faster than a normal rabbit.\n\nIt moves in a style similar to that of a spider.\n\nOnce it closes in, it jumps at the player, dealing 8 damage on Normal difficulty.\n\nIf the player strikes at the killer bunny, it runs away for a brief moment, then returns to lunging at the player.\n\nKiller bunnies are immune to the Thorns enchantment.\n\nIf it cannot find a player, the killer bunny actively seeks out and attacks any foxes or wolves, including tamed wolves.\n\nThese mobs, in return, attack the killer bunny, leading to a vicious fight.\n\nOn peaceful difficulty, the killer bunny does not despawn, despite its hostile nature.\n\nIt still attacks wolves and tamed wolves, but not the player.\n\nThe killer bunny can be bred and leashed and follows players holding carrots, despite its hostile nature.\n\n\"Toast\" redirects here.\n\nFor messages displayed on-screen, see Toasts, Advancements, Recipes, or Tutorial hints.\n\nFor Bread, see Bread.\n\nThe rabbit named \"Toast\" Naming a rabbit Toast (using either a name tag or a renamed spawn egg) re-textures it to have the appearance of a black Dutch, with a large black and white patch and more black fur around the face than the natural black and white spotted rabbit.\n\nOther than its name and skin, Toast behaves exactly like it would if it were unnamed.\n\nWhen Toast rabbits are bred, whether with each other or with regular rabbits, their offspring do not have the Toast pattern; they have a pattern consistent with the parents' original coloring prior to renaming.\n\nIf the player renames a killer bunny to Toast, it still attacks players and wolves.\n\nLike the killer bunny, Toast does not spawn naturally.\n\nThis rabbit is the skin of user xyzen420's girlfriend's missing rabbit, which Ryan Holtz implemented as a memorial.\n\n[3] Java Edition: Regular rabbits use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nKiller bunnies use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Rabbits have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Additional fields for mobs that can breed Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs MoreCarrotTicks: Set to 40 when a carrot crop is eaten, decreases by 0\u20132 every tick until it reaches 0.\n\nHas no effect in game.\n\nRabbitType: Determines the skin of the rabbit.\n\nAlso determines if rabbit should be hostile.\n\nMain article: Rabbit/DV [edit ] Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nNote: this video is outdated as rabbits can no longer be tamed, rabbits are smaller now, and the killer rabbit is now called the killer bunny.\n\nIssues relating to \"Rabbit\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe Killer Bunny is a reference to the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog from the British comedy film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which it was formerly named.\n\nThe Killer Bunny was suggested by X user @88bully.\n\n[7] The death sound for the rabbit is called bunnymurder.ogg.\n\nA brown rabbit running.\n\nRyan Holtz modeling the rabbit.\n\nThe first image of a rabbit tweeted by Ryan Holtz.\n\nThe second image of a rabbit tweeted by Ryan Holtz.\n\nThe third image of a rabbit tweeted by Ryan Holtz.\n\nThe fourth image of a rabbit tweeted by Ryan Holtz.\n\nThe fifth image of a rabbit tweeted by Ryan Holtz.\n\nBaby rabbits.\n\nFirst image of Toast.\n\nSecond image of Toast.\n\nThird image of Toast.\n\nFourth image of Toast.\n\nThe first image of the Killer Bunny.\n\nThe second image of the Killer Bunny.\n\nA pen of rabbits.\n\nThe second Killer Bunny texture, similar to a normal white rabbit.\n\nAll of the available rabbit skins.\n\nThe Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog as a baby.\n\nThe third Killer Bunny texture, with blood on its mouth and paws.\n\nKiller bunny.\n\nA rabbit eating a carrot.\n\nLego Minecraft Black Rabbit.\n\nLego Minecraft Baby Brown Rabbit.\n\nA rabbit in official artwork for The Wild Update.\n\nRabbit art.\n\nJumbo Rabbit from Minecraft Earth.\n\nA rabbit preparing to shoot Steve with a crossbow.\n\n[8] The White Rabbit texture in Bedrock Edition 1.9.\n\n\u2191 MC-207993 \u2191 MC-158608 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 \"@xyZenTV The skin only appears when you name the rabbit Toast using a name tag, it isn't in the random pool:\" \u2013 @TheMogMiner (Ryan Holtz) on X, July 1, 2014 \u2191 https://minecraft.net/article/who-framed-killer-rabbit \u2191 \"FYI, I asked Josh to remove this feature again.\n\nAlthough funny, being scared of rabbits doesn't fit with the Beast's lore.\" \u2013 @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X, October 30, 2018 \u2191 MC-96449 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 \"@88bully @xyZenTV You, I like you.\n\nI like the way you think.\n\nHowever, no promises.\n\nPromises are made to be broken.\" \u2013 @TheMogMiner (Ryan Holtz) on X, June 6, 2014 \u2191 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-85xXgFHlE Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

biomes.\n\n5% spawn as baby sheep.\n\nTwo sheep sometimes spawn in shepherd houses, butcher houses and animal pens in villages.\n\nAn adult sheep drops: 1 wool of the corresponding color.\n\nSheep that have not regrown their wool do not drop wool.\n\n1\u20132 raw mutton (cooked mutton if killed while on fire or when in water using a sword with fire aspect).\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 1\u20135 with Looting III.\n\n1\u20133 experience orbs if killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nWhen sheared, sheep give 1\u20133 wool and do not take any damage.\n\nThis is not affected by Fortune or Looting.\n\nUpon successful breeding, 1\u20137 is dropped.\n\nKilling a baby sheep yields no items nor experience.\n\nSheep wander aimlessly and individually or in small flocks of two to four.\n\nSheep avoid cliffs and hazardous areas if it warrants damage.\n\nSheep emit hoarse bleats in mostly random patterns and especially when attacked.\n\nIf harmed, sheep flee for a few seconds, but make no special attempt to avoid wolves.\n\nSheep are nonchalant to players or other mobs, but follow a player holding wheat within a six blocks radius.\n\nAdult sheep can't fit through a gap if the 90-degree intersection of two fences is removed whereas the player and most other mobs can get through easily.\n\nSheep graze grass (but not tall grass), making it disappear, and grass blocks, changing them into dirt blocks.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, they can also eat ferns.\n\nBaby sheep graze grass much more often than adults and mature 1 minute faster when grazing.\n\nSheep can eat grass through blocks that are less than a full block thick, including extremities such as honey blocks, as well as from inside minecarts.\n\nA sheared sheep regrows its wool after grazing.\n\nTherefore, if no grass is available, a sheep cannot regrow its wool after being sheared.\n\nIf an adult sheep has the opportunity, the chance of eating grass is 1 \u2044 1000 every other game tick (1 \u2044 50 for baby sheep).\n\nIf / gamerule mobGriefing is set to false, grass blocks remain, but the sheep still regrow their wool.\n\n[1] Sheep's wool can be dyed by pressing the use key or the interact button while holding any dye.\n\nSheared sheep cannot be dyed until their wool grows back after eating a grass block.\n\nDyeing changes the color of the sheep's wool permanently or until the sheep is dyed again.\n\nThe new wool colors will be inherited by baby sheep.\n\nIf a sheep is dyed and then sheared, it retains its new dyed wool color after the wool regrows.\n\nIn Java Edition, the wool patches that are seen on a sheared sheep always appear white regardless of their actual color.\n\n[2] The wool texture on the sheep's face also always appear white regardless of their actual color.\n\nSee also: Easter eggs \u00a7 Naming_mobs An evoker can also change a sheep's wool color if the evoker is unengaged in combat and / gamerule mobGriefing is set to true.\n\nThen it can change the wool color of any blue sheep within 16 blocks to red.\n\nIt signals the spell by producing orange color particles () and making a \"wololo\" sound.\n\nThis is a reference to the priest unit of the 1997 game Age of Empires.\n\nA sheep named \u201cjeb_\u201d.\n\nIf a sheep is named jeb_, its wool cycles through all dye colors in a similar manner to prismarine.\n\nThis is purely a visual effect.\n\nA sheep named jeb_ can still be dyed without changing the rainbow effect and any wool obtained from one of these sheep has the most recent color as if the sheep was unnamed.\n\nAn example of how a bred sheep inherits a mixture of its parents' colors when possible.\n\nSee also: Breeding Sheep can be bred using wheat, after which they spawn a baby sheep.\n\nThey cannot breed for five minutes after the baby sheep appears.\n\nIf the parents have compatible wool colors (meaning that the corresponding dye items could be combined into a third dye color), the resulting baby sheep inherits a mix of their colors (e.g., blue sheep + white sheep = light blue baby sheep).\n\nIf the dye colors cannot normally be mixed, the baby sheep spawns with the same color as one of the parents, chosen randomly, regardless of whether one or both parents have been sheared.\n\nThe 20-minute growth of baby sheep can be slightly accelerated using wheat.\n\nEach use takes 10% off the remaining time to grow up.\n\nIt can also accelerate its own growth by eating grass.\n\nJava Edition: Sheep use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Sheep have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity

Height: 1.75 Blocks Width: 1.9 Blocks Snifflet: Height: 0.7875 Blocks Width: 0.855 Blocks A sniffer is a passive mob that does not spawn naturally, and can only be hatched from sniffer eggs.\n\nIt sniffs out and digs out seeds for various unique decorative plants out of dirt, grass, and moss blocks.\n\nSniffers spawn by hatching from sniffer eggs found in suspicious sand from warm ocean ruins.\n\nBreeding sniffers with torchflower seeds would also result in a sniffer egg being laid as an item.\n\nWhen killed, adult sniffers drop 1\u20133 experience points if killed by a player or a tamed wolf; snifflets drop no experience just like other baby animals.\n\nUpon successful breeding, 1\u20137 is dropped.\n\nSniffers wander aimlessly, avoiding hazards and obstacles.\n\nThey occasionally smell their surroundings and track ancient seeds by pressing their nose to the ground.\n\nWhen they find a seed, they sploot [1] and use their noses to dig into the ground until they get torchflower seeds or a pitcher pod.\n\nFor a sniffer to be able to dig it needs to be doing nothing else, not in water, on the ground, not in a boat or minecart and the block underneath the head needs to be diggable and reachable for the sniffer.\n\nThe head location is defined as 2.25 blocks in front of the center of the body.\n\nThe sniffer also stores the last 20 locations it has dug up so it can't dig there anymore.\n\nAfter sniffing out seeds, an eight minute cooldown is activated before it can dig in again.\n\nThe following blocks are diggable by the sniffer: Dirt Grass Block Podzol Coarse Dirt Rooted Dirt Moss Block Mud Muddy Mangrove Roots Data packs from Java Edition can change this list by modifying the minecraft:sniffer_diggable_block block tag.\n\nSniffers cannot dig on mycelium.\n\n[2] The player can breed the sniffers using torchflower seeds.\n\nWhen two adult sniffers are bred, they drop a sniffer egg, after which the parents have a 5-minute cooldown before they can breed again.\n\nSniffers are healed by 2 health points each time they are fed a torchflower seed.\n\nA baby sniffer is called a snifflet [3] and they have a bigger head than the adult.\n\nSnifflets take 48000 game ticks to grow up into adult sniffers, which is equal to 40 minutes or two in-game days, twice as long as most other baby mobs in the game.\n\nUnlike most baby mobs, snifflets do not follow their adults.\n\n[4] Java Edition: Sniffers use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 MC-260219 \u2014 Sniffer eating sounds aren't

The sniffer was Nekofresa's first mob ever designed for Minecraft.\n\n[6] The plants that sniffers find are based off kniphofia genus of perennial flowering plants, which can be similarly called \"torch lilies\" as a common name for torchflowers and pitcher pods are loosely based off existing pitcher plants but with an orchid or ornamental vibe.\n\n[7] The sniffer's walking animation was inspired by the leg movement that centipedes do.\n\n[8] During the prototype phase for the sniffer's digging up of items the developers used beds as a placeholder.\n\n[9] Due to the size of the sniffer it was a big challenge for the developers to perfect its pathfinding especially on 1 block edges.\n\nA new team made up of new developers were tasked with developing the sniffer, and most of them had never made a mob before.\n\n[10] The sniffer's digging animation was inspired by the way corgis spread their legs while lying down.\n\n[11] To this day, the developers still don't know what the sniffer's front yellow part is.\n\nWhether it's a beak, a nose, or eyes, or whether it's used for breathing or finding seeds is unknown.\n\n[12] A baby sniffer is called a snifflet in an article on Minecraft.net [13] and in the achievement \"Little Sniffs\".\n\nOriginal ideas for what a baby sniffer would be called were Sniffling, Snort and Snifflet.\n\n[14] Mojang developer Cory Scheviak personally calls sniffers \"snuffleupaguses\".\n\nThe reason why sniffers don\u2019t spawn naturally and are at first only hatched from their preserved eggs is due to the sniffer being extinct prior

[Bedrock Edition only ] In-game squid have eight tentacles, but in real life they also have two long tentacles.\n\nThe in-game squid is thus closer to an octopus.\n\nIn-game squid have a gaping, tooth-lined mouth but as passive mobs they're completely harmless.\n\nReal-life squid, like all cephalopods, have a beak instead of teeth.\n\nSquid are not affected by the \"Dinnerbone\" and \"Grumm\" name tag easter egg.\n\n[6] A squid.\n\nDying squid mob.\n\nA squid under ice.\n\nThe underside of a squid.\n\nA squid riding a minecart.\n\nFlying squid.\n\nSquid that have spawned from the side of a hill.\n\nA squid beached on the land.\n\nAfter a few seconds, it dies.\n\nA squid that has spawned in a village farm.\n\nA squid compared to a baby squid in Bedrock Edition.\n\nA squid squirting ink to blind the attacking player.\n\nSquid and baby squid in Bedrock Edition, along with an 'ink cloud'.\n\nA squid taking suffocation damage from being out of the water.\n\nA squid, along with some fish and a turtle.\n\nA guardian attacking a squid.\n\nThe mouth of a squid A squid stranded out of water.\n\nA squid inside a cave.\n\nSquid in the Nether The squid in a cave A former bug that allowed squid to appear flying.\n\nA squid stranded inside a cave.\n\nA squid atop a tree.\n\nSeveral squid underwater.\n\nIn early game versions, it was possible to get water to the nether, in which squid could spawn.\n\nA baby squid.\n\nArtwork A squid in Minecraft: Story Mode.\n\nLego Minecraft Squid.\n\nSquid from Minecraft Plus.\n\nOfficial T-shirt artwork \"Rumor Has It\" made by JINX.\n\nOfficial T-shirt artwork \"Squid Pro Quo\" made by JINX.\n\nThe name of the art is a reference to the noun: quid pro quo.\n\nOfficial T-shirt artwork \"Flying Squid\" made by JINX.\n\nSquid plush made by JINX.\n\nA squid in official artwork for The Wild Update.\n\nSquid art.\n\nTutorials/Squid farming Ink Sac \u2191 MC-240990 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 MC-132473 \u2014 Squid and glow squid can swim one block above water \u2191 MC-212687 \u2014 Squids and glow squids stop moving if player is a little far from them \u2191 MC-136647 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 MC-237079 \u2191 MC-115092 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

[JE only ] [3] Striders wearing a saddle always drop the saddle upon death, regardless of whether they spawn wearing it or a player put it on them.\n\nThe only way to remove a saddle from a strider is to kill the strider.\n\nWhen an adult strider is killed by a player or tamed wolf, 1\u20132 [JE only ] / 1\u20133 [BE only ] experience is dropped.\n\nLava does not damage striders.\n\nUnlike most mobs, striders can walk on top of lava without sinking.\n\nUpon being harmed by another mob, striders attempt to flee for a few seconds while making \"retreat\" noises.\n\nStriders are damaged by water, rain, and splash water bottles, which deal damage by 1 per splash water bottle or half-second in water or rain, which can kill them.\n\nWhile in water, they slowly sink while taking damage.\n\nStriders still take damage from rain even if they are in lava.\n\nHowever, they are not harmed when standing in a filled cauldron.\n\nThey are not harmed by snowfall or snowballs.\n\nThey take extra damage from freezing in powder snow.\n\nUnlike piglins and hoglins, striders can exist safely in the Overworld, as long as they are kept away from water and rain.\n\nUnlike some other mobs, striders do not zombify when leaving the Nether.\n\nStriders outside of lava change to a dull purple color, change their expression to more of a frown, shiver, and their legs become slightly shorter.\n\nThey also move slower when outside of lava.\n\n[4] If a strider has the Speed effect applied to it, the strider moves faster on both land and lava (though its land speed is still considerably slow).\n\nIf a zombified piglin is riding a strider, the strider pursues the player if the zombified piglin is angered.\n\nDue to a bug, [5] striders that fall from a height take fall damage when landing in lava source blocks.\n\nThis does not occur for striders that fall into flowing lava.\n\nA baby strider on an adult strider still grows into an adult.\n\nApart from this, adult striders riding other adult striders do not spawn naturally.\n\nBaby striders not riding on an adult follow the closest adult strider.\n\nA strider walking.\n\nA strider shivering and slowed down on land.\n\nMain article: Riding A player riding a strider (click to see animation).\n\nThe player can ride on an adult strider using a saddle.\n\nSimilar to how pigs are controlled using a carrot on a stick, striders move forward automatically while their direction is influenced using a warped fungus on a stick, at a speed of 4.14 m/s if on a flat lava surface (such as the Nether lava sea) or 1.74 m/s if on land.\n\nThey walk especially slowly against the lava flow direction.\n\nWarped fungus on a stick can be used, causing the strider to boost and walk at a greater speed [more information needed ] and taking 1 point of durability from the warped fungus on a stick.\n\nThey also follow players holding a warped fungus or a warped fungus on a stick.\n\nUnlike underwater boats, players riding striders into lava (for example, getting into flowing-only from heights or horizons, static lava from horizons) do not dismount if the strider submerges into the lava, and striders slowly rise back up to the surface if this happens.\n\nHowever, players risk getting burned by the lava while submerged.\n\nHowever, in Java Edition, players cannot start riding a strider that is fully submerged within the lava.\n\nWhen ridden over land, striders automatically walk up any one block high slope.\n\nThey also cross any 1-wide block gap or air space that is only one block higher - diagonally up - when ridden directly upward and not completely sideways to the slope.\n\nTo safely dismount from a strider, a player who does not have Fire Resistance may face a solid block within reach before dismounting to dismount onto that block, [6] instead of at the strider's location (which is usually in lava [7]).\n\nStriders can still be equipped with a saddle while another mob is riding it.\n\nMain article: Breeding If striders are given warped fungus, they breed to create baby striders, granting the player 1\u20137 experience orbs.\n\nThe parent striders have a cooldown of about 5 minutes before they can breed again.\n\nAll babies obtained through breeding take 20 minutes to grow up.\n\nThe growth of baby striders can be slowly accelerated using warped fungus; each use takes 10% off of the remaining time to grow up.\n\nJava Edition: Striders use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b MC-184399 Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Striders have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Additional fields for mobs that can breed Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Saddle: 1 or 0 (true/false) -

instead, they reference real-life fish species.\n\nIn Java Edition, these unique fish are limited to the 22 common varieties.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, there are 21 uniquely-named tropical fish, though they are not all the same as in Java Edition.\n\nThese uniquely-named tropical fish aren't different from regular tropical fish in terms of design or behavior.\n\nBedrock edition does not have the Yellowtail Parrotfish.\n\nThese varieties are: \u2191 Sunstreak in Java Edition, SunStreak in Bedrock Edition.\n\nJava Edition: Tropical fish use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 The fish's momentum, with the horizontal axes' velocities multiplied by 0.2 (capped at 1.0) \u2191 a b MC-200508 Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Tropical fish have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs FromBucket: 1 or 0 (true/false) - Whether the fish had ever been released from a bucket.\n\nVariant: A 4-byte integer.\n\nThe least significant byte has a value of either 0 for a small fish, or 1 for a large fish.\n\nValues above 1 result in an invisible fish.\n\nThe next byte has a value from 0\u20135, representing the pattern on the fish.\n\nValues above 5 result in a fish with no pattern.\n\nThe next byte has a value from 0\u201315, representing the color of the fish's body.\n\nThe most significant byte has a value from 0\u201315, representing the color of the fish's pattern.\n\nMain article: Tropical Fish/DV [edit ] The fish sizes and patterns are depicted in the following table, with white body color and dark-gray pattern color.\n\nThe 22 varieties of tropical fish most commonly found throughout the world have Variant tag values from the following table, which also lists what color/shape/patterns come from that value.\n\nThe variant number is the sum of the most significant byte \u00d7 2 24 + second most significant byte \u00d7 2 16 + second least significant byte \u00d7 2 8 + least significant byte.\n\nIssues relating to \"Tropical fish\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nAn ocean with some fish visible.\n\nCod and tropical fish, along with a turtle and squid.\n\nA screenshot of tropical fish up close.\n\nSome tropical fish jumping on land.\n\nTropical Fish as shown in the Update Aquatic artwork.\n\nTropical Fish from Update Aquatic artwork.\n\nTropical Fish in promotional artwork for the first Caves & Cliffs update.\n\nTropical fish in official artwork for The Wild Update.\n\nTropical fish art.\n\nTropical fish art.\n\nTropical fish art.\n\nTropical fish art.\n\nTropical fish art.\n\nIn the texture files of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, there is a hidden texture of a clownfish mob.\n\nClownfish were food items that existed before Update Aquatic, which were replaced by Tropical Fish food items.\n\nIt is likely that clownfish were intended to become a mob before being expanded into over 2700 variants of tropical fish.\n\nCod Salmon Pufferfish \u2191 MC-212795 \u2014 Salmon & Fish mobs are not affected by Looting \u2191 MC-126819 \u2013 \"fish bouncing and suffocating on top of the cauldron which fills with water\" resolved as \"Won't Fix\" \u2191 MC-169763 Resolved as \"Works as Intended\" \u2191 MC-221656 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

items Seagrass Details Size In Java Edition: Adult: Height: 0.4 Blocks Width: 1.2 Blocks Baby: Height: 0.12 Blocks Width: 0.36 Blocks In Bedrock Edition: Adult: Height: 0.4 Blocks Width: 1.2 Blocks Baby: Height: 0.032 Blocks Width: 0.096 Blocks A turtle (in Java Edition), also known as a sea turtle (in Bedrock Edition), is a common passive mob found in beach biomes.\n\nThey are the only source of scutes, which drop from baby turtles when they mature into adults.\n\nTurtles spawn on the sand in the Overworld on beaches with daylight, but not in its snowy variant or stony shores, occasionally in small groups of up to 5 individuals.\n\n10% of turtles spawned are babies.\n\nIn Java Edition, turtles spawn at light levels greater than 8, on sand blocks less than 4 blocks above sea level.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, turtles spawn in groups of 2\u20136, at light level 7 or higher, at Y=60\u201367.\n\nWhen turtles die, they drop: 0\u20132 seagrass.\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0\u20135 with Looting III.\n\n1\u20133, if killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\n1 bowl, if killed by lightning.\n\n[1] Baby turtles do not drop anything when they die.\n\nWhen a baby turtle grows up to an adult it drops: 1 scute Upon successful breeding, 1\u20137 is dropped.\n\nTurtles can both move around on land and swim in water.\n\nThey move slowly on land, but they can swim at a fast speed in the water.\n\nLike other passive mobs, they move around aimlessly and flee when attacked.\n\nWhen on land, they generally attempt to move to the nearest water source with direct sky access.\n\n[verify ] When in an enclosed area, such as a player-made enclosure, they generally swim in circles if the water is in the area, and rarely go on land to explore, if there is any.\n\nTurtles cannot be attached to leads, [2] but they can be led by a player holding seagrass within 10 blocks of the turtle.\n\nTurtles can be picked up by boats  [Java Edition only ] and minecarts.\n\nTurtles are killed instantly when struck by lightning.\n\nAs with other aquatic mobs, turtles suffer extra damage when hit by a trident with the Impaling enchantment, [Java Edition only ]  [until JE Edition Combat Tests ] and cannot drown, despite the fact that real-life turtles breathe air.\n\nTurtles and turtle eggs are attacked by the following mobs: Zombies and their variants deliberately trample on turtle eggs, causing them to break.\n\n\u2191 a b Unlike zombies, zombified piglins, and their variants, withers and ravagers do not intentionally break turtle eggs but are able to break turtle eggs if they are in its way.\n\nTurtles remember the block on which they hatch as their home beach.\n\nNo matter how far away the turtle is, it always attempts to return to its home beach to lay its eggs after breeding.\n\nIf the player uses a tool enchanted with Silk Touch to obtain and move turtle eggs to a new location before hatching, the baby turtles remember the new hatching location as their home beach.\n\nIf a turtle is spawned from a spawn egg, summoned with the / summon command, or spawned by mob spawners, it remembers the spawn location as its home beach.\n\nA turtle digs sand around the block on which it lays its eggs.\n\nA turtle lays eggs after digging.\n\nFeeding two turtles seagrass causes them to enter love mode, causing one of the turtles to have eggs in its inventory and appear a bit bigger (about 0.2 of a block) than normal turtles.\n\nThe pregnant turtle then travels back to its home beach, which is where it first spawned.\n\nUpon arrival, it seeks a nearby sand block on which to lay its eggs.\n\nA turtle always lays eggs within 9 blocks from where it was born.\n\nThe turtle digs vigorously while turning 360 degrees for several seconds a few times, and then lays 1\u20134 turtle eggs.\n\nTurtles have a 90-second cooldown after breeding in Bedrock Edition, and a five-minute cooldown in Java Edition.\n\nTurtle eggs can be placed on any block in clusters of up to 4, however, they hatch only on sand, red sand, or suspicious sand, above or below water.\n\nEggs can be broken without tools and can also be trampled by living entities falling or walking on them.\n\nWhen a multi-egg block is trampled, eggs are broken one at a time.\n\nA turtle can walk on the eggs without breaking them.\n\nHarvesting eggs with Silk Touch drops an egg, which the player can collect.\n\nMining an egg with Silk Touch resets the egg's growth.\n\nTurtle eggs progress toward hatching by cracking.\n\nCracking occurs during random ticks, and an egg hatches once it has cracked 3 times.\n\nWhen a multi-egg block hatches, all eggs within the block hatch simultaneously.\n\nEggs grow fastest during the night and typically take 4 to 5 in-game days to hatch.\n\nSee Turtle egg#Hatching for more details.\n\nWith a height of 0.12 blocks, baby turtles are among the smallest mobs in the game.\n\nBaby turtles are small enough that when they walk on soul sand, they are entirely within the space at the top of the block.\n\nUpon hatching, baby turtles search for the nearest water block within a 47\u00d71\u00d747 region two blocks below the turtle and attempt to approach it.\n\nBaby turtles take one Minecraft day to grow up (20 minutes).\n\nThe growth can be accelerated using seagrass.\n\nEach use reduces the remaining growth duration by 10%.\n\nUpon becoming an adult, the turtle drops a scute.\n\nJava Edition: Turtles use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b c d e f MC-98316 \u2014

blocks In Bedrock Edition: Adult: Height: 1.9 blocks Width: 0.6 blocks Baby: Height: 0.95 blocks Width: 0.3 blocks Villagers are passive mobs that inhabit villages, work at their professions, breed, and interact with each other.\n\nAdult villagers' outfits vary according to their occupation and biome.\n\nA player can trade with them using emeralds as currency.\n\nThey are also the most complex mob in the game, expressing a vast array of behaviors.\n\nVillagers can be found in every type of village, which can spawn in several biomes such as plains, snowy plains, savannas, deserts, taigas, and snowy taigas  [Bedrock Edition only ] and can cut into other biomes such as swamps and jungles.\n\nWhen the village is generated, unemployed villagers spawn in them, the number of which depends on the buildings in that village, as some buildings generate villagers inside and some do not.\n\nA cleric villager and cleric zombie villager spawn locked up in the basements of igloos (if the basement generates) under the carpet of the floor.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the villager and zombie villager inside igloo basements have random professions instead of always being clerics.\n\nThe cleric villager can also turn into a leatherworker villager since the cauldron in the basement is closer to the villager.\n\nSee also: Zombie Villager \u00a7 Curing Giving a zombie villager the Weakness effect and then feeding it a golden apple starts the curing process.\n\nAfter five minutes, it transforms into a villager, displaying purple Nausea status effect particles for 10 seconds after being cured.\n\nThe villager retains the profession it had as a zombie, if it had one before turning into a zombie villager.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, if the zombie villager is player spawned, it adopts a randomly chosen profession.\n\nThe villager can also be a nitwit, as the game counts it as a \"profession\" but the nitwit villager still can't work.\n\nIf employed, the cured villager offers discounts on most of its trades.\n\nA villager, either adult or baby, does not ordinarily drop any items or experience when killed.\n\nHowever, when a player holds an emerald or other item a villager is willing to trade for, the item it offers in trade appears in its hands, alternating between items if there are multiple items the villager wants to trade.\n\nUpon successful trading, a villager drops 3\u20136.\n\nUpon successful trading, while willing to breed, 8\u201311 is dropped.\n\nNitwit and unemployed villagers leave their homes at day and begin to explore the village.\n\nGenerally, they wander inside the village during the day.\n\nThey may go indoors or outdoors, periodically making mumbling sounds.\n\nOccasionally, two villagers may stop and turn to look at each other, in a behavior called socializing, during which they stare at another villager for 4\u20135 seconds at a time.\n\nThey continuously stare at a nearby player unless the villager is trying to get into a house at night, farm food, work, or flee from a zombie or illager.\n\nBaby villagers may jump on beds and play tag with each other, similarly to how baby piglins and baby hoglins play tag.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, baby villagers do not stop continuously in front of players, though they still do stare as they move.\n\nVillagers tend to not travel far from their beds in a large village unless the job site or the nearest gossip site (bell) is far from their beds.\n\nVillagers, like other mobs, can find paths around obstructions, avoid walking off cliffs of heights greater than 3 blocks, and avoid some blocks that cause harm.\n\nHowever, in crowded situations, one villager can push another off a cliff or into harm's way.\n\nVillagers emit green particles if they join a village, set a bed, or acquire a job site/profession.\n\nVillagers run inside at night or during rain, closing doors behind them.\n\nThey attempt to sleep at night, but if they cannot claim a bed, they stay indoors near a bed until morning.\n\nIn the morning, they head outside and resume normal behavior.\n\nHowever, some villagers, such as nitwits, stay outside later than others unless being chased by an illager or zombie.\n\nIf a villager finds itself outside the village boundary, or a villager without a village detects a village boundary within 32 blocks, it moves quickly back within the boundary.\n\nA villager taken more than 32 blocks away from its village boundary forgets the village within about 6 seconds.\n\nWhether in a village or not, a villager is never prone to despawning.\n\nVillagers can open all wooden doors and find paths or blocks of interest behind the doors.\n\nHowever, they cannot open any trapdoors, fence gates, or iron doors.\n\nVillagers can climb ladders, but do not recognize them as paths and do not deliberately use them.\n\nAny climbing of ladders seems to be a side effect of them being pushed into the block by another mob, (likely, and most often, other villagers).\n\nUnfortunately, this behavior can leave them stranded on the second floors and roofs of some village structures, as they lack the necessary AI to intentionally descend ladders.\n\n[verify ] A simple fix for these situations is for the player to manually push the villager back toward the ladder hole and then install a wooden trapdoor at the top, after the villager is returned to the ground level.\n\nOne way to prevent a villager from climbing ladders is to break the first ladder touching the ground thus requiring a player to jump to the ladder to climb.\n\nVillagers flee from zombies, zombie villagers, husks, drowned, zombified piglins  [Bedrock Edition only ], zoglins, vindicators, pillagers (even if their crossbow has been broken), ravagers, and vexes within 8 blocks, and evokers and illusioners within 12 blocks in Java Edition /16 blocks in Bedrock Edition.\n\nLike other passive mobs, villagers sprint away when attacked.\n\nVillagers do not run away from skeletons (and their variants), spiders, or cave spiders since these hostile mobs are passive towards villagers, although a skeleton arrow might hit a villager by accident.\n\nVillagers favor pathways to reach a selected destination and try to stay in low-cost blocks, like the dirt path or cobblestone blocks.\n\nThey also avoid jumping.\n\nFor a list of job site blocks and the professions they are required for, see \u00a7 Professions.\n\nUnemployed villagers (other than babies and nitwits) seek employment at job site blocks (also referred to as workstations), and employed villagers use job site blocks to refresh their trades (see \u00a7 Working).\n\nVillagers who have made their first trade can only claim a site block that corresponds with their profession, whereas tradeless villagers may change their profession to match a site block.\n\nIn Java Edition, unemployed villagers claim job site blocks by searching for the nearest unclaimed site in a 48-block sphere.\n\nWhen a suitable site block is detected, the villager starts pathfinding to it, staking a provisional claim.\n\nThis can only occur while the villager is awake.\n\nA provisional claim is released if the villager cannot reach the block within 60 seconds, however the villager may try again immediately.\n\n[1] To fully claim the site and change profession, the villager must approach within a 2-block radius of the job site's center.\n\nWhen a job site block is fully claimed, its owner emits green particles, and no other villager can claim the block unless the owner relinquishes it.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, all villagers search for unclaimed job sites in a 16 block radius and 4 block height.\n\nIf a site block is found, it is added to a shared list of valid job site blocks for the whole village.\n\nAn unemployed villager with a bed claims the first site block on that list and immediately change profession to match, regardless of distance or accessibility to the site block.\n\n[2] A villager may make a claim while sleeping.\n\nIf a villager cannot pathfind to their claimed site, both the block and the villager emit anger particles; the job site block may need to be broken before the villager relinquishes it.\n\n[verify ] When a job site block is claimed, both the block and the villager making the claim emit green particles and the site block is removed from the list.\n\nA desert villager and a plains villager gossiping.\n\nVillagers can store certain memories about players in the form of gossip.\n\nThese get spread to other villagers whenever they talk with each other.\n\nEach piece of gossip is one of five types, and it stores a value as well as a target.\n\nGossips generate and increase in value as a result of various player actions.\n\nThe target is the player who caused the gossip.\n\nTogether the gossip values determine a player's reputation with the villager, which influence trading prices and the hostility of naturally spawned iron golems.\n\nTrading with or curing a villager increase the value of the corresponding gossips for the targeted villager only.\n\nWhen a villager is attacked or killed, however, it instead generates the major negative gossip in every other villager it could see (eye-to-eye line of sight) inside a box extending 16 blocks from the villager in all coordinate directions.\n\nWhen a piece of gossip is shared, it is received at a lower value than the sharer has it.\n\nGossips also decay a certain amount (see Decay column) every 20 minutes.\n\nSince major positive gossip have a share penalty equal to its max value and a decay of 0, it cannot be shared and never decays.\n\nA player's total reputation with a villager is determined by multiplying each gossip's value by their respective multiplier and adding the results together.\n\nFor example, if a player has recently cured a villager for the first time but also attacked the villager twice, their reputation with that villager would be 5 \u00d7 20 + 25 - 50 = 75.\n\nAfter 40 minutes the gossips have decayed twice, making the player's reputation 5 \u00d7 20 + 23 - 10 = 113.\n\nThe prices of a villager's trades all get reduced by reputation times the price multiplier rounded down, meaning that a positive reputation lowers prices but a negative reputation increase them.\n\nThe price multiplier is either 0.05 or 0.2 depending on the item, see trading.\n\nPrices can not get lower than 1 or higher than the item's stack size.\n\nThe exact function to calculate the price affected by the gossips is y = x - floor((5a + b + c - d - 5e) \u00d7 p), Where y is the final price, x is the base price, a is the value of major_positive, b is the value of minor_positive, c is the value of trading, d is the value of minor_negative, e is the value of major_negative, and p is the value of PriceMultiplier.\n\nIron golems that were not built by a player become hostile towards players whose reputation with any nearby villager is -100 or lower.\n\nThe golem checks all villagers inside a box centered on the golem and extending 10 blocks in every horizontal direction and 8 blocks in both vertical directions.\n\nPlayers can set villagers on fire using flint and steel or lava without affecting gossips.\n\nThe same is true for TNT activated by redstone or a dispenser.\n\nHowever, TNT ignited directly by a player (using flint and steel, fire charges or flaming arrows) does generate gossip for damaged or killed villagers, because the TNT's damage is attributed to the player.\n\nVillagers have eight hidden inventory slots, which start empty whenever the villager is spawned.\n\nVillagers do not intentionally seek out items to pick up, but they do collect any bread, carrots, potatoes, wheat, wheat seeds, beetroot, beetroot seeds, torchflower seeds, pitcher pods, and bone meal within range (bone meal can be picked up only by farmer villagers).\n\nThese are the only items they can pick up, although the player may use the / item replace command to put a random item into a villager's inventory.\n\nVillagers can fill all 8 inventory slots with the same item.\n\nIf a player and a villager are in the pickup range of an item at the same time, the player always picks it up first.\n\nIf several villagers are next to an item, the same one picks up the item every time.\n\nConsequently, in constrained space, the same villager picks up any item dropped.\n\nThis behavior prevents villagers from sharing food in a one-block space.\n\nWhen killed or converted to a zombie villager, any inventory item of the villager is lost, even when / gamerule keepInventory is set to true.\n\nIf / gamerule mobGriefing is false, villagers cannot pick up items, and farmer villagers cannot plant or harvest crops.\n\nLike other mobs, villagers have four slots for worn armor, separate from their inventory.\n\nAn adjacent dispenser can equip armor, elytra, mob heads, or carved pumpkins to a villager, but the armor is not rendered (except for carved pumpkins and mob heads).\n\nThe equipment functions as normal; for example, a villager wearing an armor piece enchanted with Thorns can inflict Thorns damage to attackers, and a villager wearing Frost Walker boots is able to create frosted ice.\n\nIf a villager is converted into a zombie villager, the armor it was wearing is dropped, though it may be able to pick it up and equip it again.\n\nVillagers sharing carrots.\n\nIn Java Edition, villagers collect bread, carrots, potatoes, beetroots, wheat seeds, beetroot seeds, and wheat.\n\nIf a villager has at least 24 of these items, it gives the extra amount to a villager with 4 or less of each these food items.\n\nThat other villager can also do this until all villagers have shared all items they could (for example, on a group of three villagers one receives 60 bread, then it shares 36 to another villager to keep 24 [3], and that same villager then shares 12 to the third villager).\n\nIn the case of wheat, villagers have a rather distinct behavior.\n\nThey do the same as other crops, but if a villager has at least 32 wheat, it tries to give half of it to another villager, making both have 16 wheat.\n\nIf a villager has 8 full stacks of any kind of food or seeds and then tries to share with another, for example a bait villager in a farm where a hopper picks it all up, it leaves 24 in each stack in its inventory instead of calculating the total amount it has, and it always tries to maintain this minimum amount, thus it can never really empty its inventory down to 0 and clear a slot to pick up other stuff, unless it uses the items when trying to breed or when farming if they are a farmer.\n\n[4] [5] In Bedrock Edition, if a villager has enough food in one inventory stack (6 bread or 24 carrots, potatoes, beetroots, or 18 wheat for farmers only) and sees a villager without enough food in one inventory stack (3 bread, 12 carrots, 12 potatoes, or 12 beetroots for non-farmers; 15 bread, 60 carrots, potatoes, or beetroot, or 45 wheat for farmers), the villager may decide to share food with that villager.\n\nTo share, a villager finds its first inventory stack with at least 4 bread, carrots, potatoes, or beetroot or with at least 6 wheat, and then throws half the stack (rounded down) in the direction of the target villager.\n\nWhen wheat is shared, it is first crafted to bread, which may result in 1 or 2 less than half the stack being shared.\n\nVillager farming.\n\nIn Java Edition, during the \"work\" portion of their schedule farmers tend nearby crops.\n\nFarmers sometimes move to random farmland blocks they detect within \u00b14 on the X and Z axes and \u00b12 on the Y axis, rather than going to their jobsite.\n\nIf there are fully-grown crop blocks or air above farmland within \u00b11 of the villager on each axis, the farmer spends 10 seconds tending them (not counting time spend walking to the next block), one per second.\n\nThe block is harvested if necessary and (re-)planted if the farmer has any seeds.\n\nIf / gamerule mobGriefing is false, villagers cannot farm.\n\nHarvesting is done regardless of the villager's current inventory, even if they lack space to pick up the results.\n\nPlanting is done as from the first eligible inventory slot.\n\nIf there is at least one non-fully-grown crop block within \u00b11 of the farmer on each axis, the farmer has bone meal, and it has been at least 8 seconds since the farmer last did some fertilization, then the farmer fertilizes up to four crop blocks (one every two seconds).\n\nWhen the farmer works at their composter, it composts excess wheat and beetroot seeds, and extracts bone meal if it is full.\n\nUp to 20 seeds are composted in one work session, but at least 10 of each type of seed are first kept.\n\nInventory slots are checked in reverse order.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, farmers tend crops within the village boundary.\n\nVillagers far enough outside the boundary of any village also tend nearby crops.\n\nFarmland to be tended is found by seeking for certain blocks up to 9 blocks away from the villager in the X and Z coordinates and up to 1 away in the Y coordinate (a 19\u00d719\u00d73 volume total).\n\nIf a farmer villager does not have enough food in one stack in its inventory (15 bread, 60 carrots, 60 potatoes, 60 beetroots, or 45 wheat) and finds fully-grown wheat, carrots, potatoes, or beetroot, the villager moves to the crop block and harvests it.\n\nIf a farmer villager has any seeds, carrots, potatoes, or beetroot seeds in his inventory and finds an air block above farmland, the villager moves to it and plants a crop.\n\nThey always plant from the first eligible slot in their inventory.\n\nFarmer villagers use and pick up bone meal.\n\nThey also fill their composter with seeds.\n\nFarmer villagers only start farming if a crop is planted on farmland previously.\n\nFarmer villagers continue to plant on the farmland even if all crops are destroyed.\n\nFor both editions, Farmer villagers cannot turn dirt, grass blocks, or dirt paths into farmland.\n\nNor they pick up any hoes to till the blocks.\n\nIf a hoe is placed into a farmer villager's mainhand or offhand via commands, they still cannot till any blocks.\n\nFarmer villagers often share their crops and food with other villagers if they have any extras.\n\nFor tutorials on breeding mechanics, see Tutorials/Village mechanics \u00a7 Breeding and population cap and Tutorials/Legacy Console village mechanics.\n\nIn Java Edition, villagers can only attempt to breed while wandering (see \u00a7 Schedules below).\n\nNote however, villagers may not always follow their schedule; they may for example start \u00a7 Panicking instead of wandering if frightened, or wander instead of \u00a7 Gathering if there is no meeting place set in the village.\n\nNote however during the night villagers will always search for their beds rather than wandering, thus they cannot breed during the night.\n\nIn Java Edition, wandering villagers may try to breed although there is no guarantee they will as villagers have multiple tasks to choose from while wandering.\n\nDuring a breeding attempt two willing (see \u00a7 Willingness below) villagers will look at each other and heart particles will appear around each of them.\n\nAn attempt succeeds if an unclaimed bed can be reached via pathfinding within a 48 block radius of the breeding villagers.\n\nIf successful, a baby villager will be created, 12 \u00a7 Food Units from each of the breeding villager's inventories will be consumed, and they must wait a 6000 tick / 5 minute cooldown before attempting to breed again.\n\nThe appearance of the child is randomly determined by either the biome type of the parents or by the biome where the breeding occurred.\n\nWhen the attempt fails anger particles are displayed, no baby villager is produced, and there is no cooldown before breeding may be attempted again.\n\nHowever, 12 food units are still consumed by each villager.\n\nSince villagers can't breed during the night they may produce up to two children a day maximum.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition a census is periodically taken to determine the current population of the village.\n\nAll villagers within the horizontal boundary of the village are counted as part of the population to determine if continued villager mating is allowed.\n\nHowever, any villager within the horizontal boundary of the village and the spherical boundary of the village attempts to enter mating mode as long as there is at least one villager within the boundary.\n\nIf two villagers simultaneously enter mating mode while they are close to one another, they breed and produce a child.\n\nThe appearance is determined by the biome where the breeding occurs in Bedrock Edition.\n\n[6] Two villagers breeding.\n\nDuring breeding, food is required and consumed from the villager's inventories.\n\nDifferent foods supply different amounts of \"food units\" to the villager.\n\nCarrots, potatoes, and beetroots count for 1 food unit each while bread counts as 4.\n\nVillagers must be willing to breed.\n\nIf a villager has 12 units of food in their inventory, they become willing.\n\nBreeding consumes the villager's food stock, therefore, after mating, villagers may cease to be willing until they regather a sufficient stock of food items.\n\nAny villager with an excess of food (usually farmers) throws food to other villagers, allowing them to pick it up and obtain enough food to become willing.\n\nThe player can also throw bread, carrots, beetroots, or potatoes at the villagers themselves to encourage breeding.\n\nVillagers consume the required food upon becoming willing.\n\nIf / gamerule mobGriefing is false, villagers don't pick up food or break crops.\n\nBreeding depends on the number of valid beds.\n\nIf a villager is \"willing\" (see \u00a7 Willingness above), villagers may breed as long as there are unclaimed beds available within the limits of the village.\n\n\u00a7 Baby villagers require beds with at least 2 empty blocks above the head (note that mobs view slabs as full blocks for pathfinding, so putting upper half slabs above a bed invalidates the bed).\n\nJob sites, jobs, doors, windows, or roofs are not required for villagers to breed.\n\nAll baby villagers are initially unemployed.\n\nSome baby villagers in Java Edition.\n\nTheir heads are smaller than Bedrock Edition or Minecraft Education baby villagers.\n\nBaby villagers sprint around, entering and leaving houses at will.\n\nThey sometimes stop sprinting to stare at other villagers, [Java Edition only ] the player, or an iron golem.\n\nIf the iron golem is holding out a poppy, the children may cautiously take the flower from its hands.\n\nBaby villagers tend to group and chase one another around the village as if playing tag.\n\nThey also jump on beds.\n\nIllagers ignore baby villagers until they reach adulthood.\n\nAn iron golem holding a poppy to a villager child.\n\nBaby villagers give gifts of poppies or wheat seeds to players who have the Hero of the Village effect in Java Edition.\n\nBaby villagers in Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education have a slightly bigger head than in Java Edition; this also can be seen in other baby mobs in the game as well.\n\nJava Edition baby villagers don't have too big of a head, so they look like a tiny normal villager.\n\nBaby villagers can fit through 1\u00d71 block gaps.\n\nA baby villager becomes an adult 20 minutes after birth, even when in a boat or a minecart.\n\nBaby villagers with no AI do not grow up.\n\nA villager gets struck by lightning.\n\nWhen lightning strikes within 3\u20134 blocks of a villager, the villager is replaced by a witch that can't despawn.\n\nEven a baby villager that is struck by lightning is turned into a two-block-tall witch.\n\nIron golems also attack any villagers that turned into witches.\n\nMain article: Iron Golem \u00a7 Villages Villagers can summon iron golems to protect themselves from hostile mobs.\n\nVillagers can summon an iron golem regardless of their profession (including nitwits) or latest working time.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a golem can spawn if there are at least 20 beds and 10 villagers.\n\nAll villagers in the village must have a bed, and a profession with access to the profession block.\n\nIt spawns in a 16\u00d76\u00d716 area around the village center and attempts to spawn once every 700 game ticks, or about every 35 seconds.\n\nOne golem spawns per 10 villagers.\n\nThe golem must be killed near the village as villagers have a long cooldown time for golems that wander away.\n\nA villager panicking.\n\nVillagers sometimes panic during a raid or a zombie siege by emitting water particles and shaking.\n\nDuring this time, Villagers refuse to sleep until the raid is over.\n\nIn Java Edition, villagers panic if they see a mob that is hostile toward villagers, like a zombie, zombie villager, husk, drowned, zoglin, illager, vex, wither, or ravager and flee frantically from them, sometimes hiding in houses.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, villagers panic by running around in circles around a bed in a village house, such as when a raid happens or when the player rings the village bell.\n\nJava Edition villagers in panic are more likely to summon iron golems.\n\nTo see these mobs, the villager must have an unobstructed line of sight to it (eye-level to eye-level), and be within a certain range (spherical distance between feet center bottom-most point of the villager and hostile mob): Main articles: Siege and Zombie Zombies, zombie villagers, husks, and drowned seek out and attack villagers within a 35\u2013 to 52.5\u2013block radius (depending on regional difficulty) [Java Edition only ] or a 16-block radius [Bedrock Edition only ] (even when the villager is invisible).\n\nZombies attempt to break down doors, but only a fraction of zombies can do so and can succeed only when difficulty is set to hard.\n\nZombies who cannot break doors tend to crowd around a door that separates them from a villager.\n\nIf a zombie or a drowned comes across a set of doors with one open, it usually tries to go through the closed door.\n\nBoth zombies and drowned either kill villagers or convert them to zombie villagers.\n\nThe chance of the villager becoming a zombie villager upon death is 0% on Easy, 50% on Normal, and 100% on Hard.\n\nBaby villagers can be infected by zombies as well.\n\nDrowned are able to convert villagers to zombie villagers, even when attacking with a trident from a distance.\n\nMain article: Raid During a raid, villagers flee from illagers and run to the nearest house, similar to a zombie siege.\n\nFor a villager to hide, the house must have a door and at least one bed.\n\nBefore the first raid wave in Java Edition, at least one villager rushes to ring the bell in the center of the village (if they are close enough) to warn the other villagers of an incoming raid before going into their house.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the bell rings automatically regardless of whether a villager is nearby.\n\nIn Java Edition, when a bell is rung, all illagers within 48 blocks get the glowing effect for 3 seconds.\n\nA villager often stays in the house it first entered, but may exit the house occasionally.\n\nThe player can still trade with villagers during a raid.\n\nOn random occasions, the villager displays water particles as if sweating.\n\nIn Java Edition, once the player gains the Hero of the Village status after defeating a raid, villagers give them a discount for their trades and throw them gifts related to their profession.\n\nFor a list of items that they can gift, see Hero of the Village \u00a7 Gifts.\n\nA lot of villagers staring at the player.\n\nVillagers stare at any player that stares at them, or goes near them.\n\nThis also applies for some mobs, especially wolves.\n\nA villager first turns its head towards the player, then the body.\n\nVillagers can keep staring at the player unless a raid happens or a zombie comes and chases them off.\n\nA villager staring at the player.\n\nVillagers have set schedules depending on their age and employment status.\n\nSchedules define the villager's goals, which mostly determine how they behave throughout the day.\n\nHowever, their goals can be interrupted by higher priority behaviors most villagers have, such as fleeing from an attack, trading, and getting out of the rain.\n\nEmployed villagers spend most of their day standing next to their job site blocks.\n\nFrom time to time, they \"gather supplies\" by wandering a short distance away, then returning.\n\nSome professions have additional job-specific goals that are part of their work schedule: Farmers harvest and sow crops.\n\nLibrarians inspect bookshelves. [Bedrock Edition only ] When a villager reaches its job site block, it commences \"work\".\n\nTwo times a day, this action of working resupplies any locked trades.\n\nVillagers can resupply twice per day, even without having a bed or while sitting in a minecart.\n\nA villager can \"reach\" its job site block if the block is in any of the 8 directly adjacent or diagonal block spaces horizontally around it at the height of their feet, or at the 9 blocks below that.\n\nVillagers can still \"reach\" them diagonally, even if they can't see or touch the face of the block.\n\nEmployed villagers do not breed with each other during their work schedule.\n\nNitwits and the unemployed do not follow this rule as they would breed with each other and the employed villagers.\n\nLeatherworker villagers work at any cauldron; the cauldron does not have to be filled with water in order for the villager to work at it.\n\nAll villagers wander from time to time, but for the unemployed and nitwits, they wander for the majority of their day.\n\nA wandering villager chooses a random block and walks toward it, then stands there for a variable amount of time before wandering again.\n\nIf at any time it detects a job site block it can claim, it does so, assumes the skin for the associated profession, and immediately begins following the appropriate schedule.\n\nA villager attempts to claim a job site block by finding a path to a block next to one, showing angry particles when unable to reach it.\n\nAfter a villager fails to reach the job site block several times, it becomes unclaimed, indicated by showing angry particles on it.\n\nThe villager loses its job site block and eventually becomes unemployed if the villager is at novice-level and no nearby job site block is available.\n\nAny other nearby unemployed villager has a chance to become the block's new owner.\n\nIf there are no unemployed villagers nearby, then the villager who lost the job site block seeks for another unclaimed one or tries to reclaim the same unreachable one in an endless loop (this also happens for claiming beds).\n\nThe wander schedule includes a job-specific goal called \"exploring the outskirts\" that causes villagers to wander near the edges of the village.\n\nThis enables them to detect new beds, job site blocks, bells, and houses that players have used to extend the village.\n\nDuring this time of the day, they may also share items.\n\nIn Java Edition this is the only time of day villagers are able to breed.\n\nAs there are multiple tasks villagers may choose to do, there is no guarantee they will breed.\n\nLate in the day, adult villagers gather at a meeting place (the area around a bell).\n\nWhen two villagers encounter one another, they mingle (look at each other and \"converse\" by humming at other villagers).\n\nIf a villager isn't close enough to detect a bell, it wanders randomly, searching for one.\n\n5 villager children chasing one another.\n\nBaby villagers wander randomly around the village.\n\nWhen they encounter another baby villager, the two of them follow each other for a while and sometimes run as if racing or chasing each other.\n\nIn Java Edition, they sometimes stop to jump and bounce on a bed or to stare at an iron golem they encounter.\n\nIf the iron golem offers them a poppy, the baby villager cautiously accepts it.\n\nAll villagers head home a short time before sunset.\n\nThey roam around until they get near their beds, then target a block beside the bed.\n\nOnce they reach their beds, they do not go through a door again before sleeping.\n\nA villager who has no bed simply waits inside a house until morning.\n\nThis includes players stealing a villager's bed to sleep in, mostly the villager stays in the house and doesn't move until sunrise.\n\nBut sometimes, if they detect a unclaimed bed nearby they walk out of the house and towards the bed.\n\nA villager pushed on a bed in Java Edition.\n\nThe villager falls off the bed if it is pushed again.\n\nDropping an anvil on a villager that is sleeping in Java Edition does not hurt the villager nor causes the villager to wake up.\n\nA villager sleeping in a bed at night (from the top view).\n\nAt sunset, villagers lie down in their beds and remain there until morning.\n\nVillagers wake early if food is thrown at them  [Java Edition only ], they are pushed out of bed, or if their bed is destroyed.\n\nThey also wake up when their bed is used, if they are attacked, or when a bell is rung.\n\nIf possible, they return to sleeping in a bed after the interruption.\n\n# Jumping on a bed with a villager sleeping in it doesn't cause the villager to get up.\n\nIn Java Edition, villagers can be pushed on beds and sometimes turn their heads.\n\nA villager can be pushed off a bed, [7] but most likely to go back to sleeping after staring at the player who pushed the villager for a few seconds.\n\nWhen sleeping in Bedrock Edition, a villager's hitbox reduces to a cube restricted to the pillow part of the bed.\n\nIf an anvil is dropped on the hitbox, the villager takes damage and wakes up.\n\nIn Java Edition, dropping any anvil on a villager that is sleeping causes the anvil to bounce and drop as an item, and the villager remains sleeping and does not take damage.\n\nA villager who has no bed continues wandering in search of a bed to claim.\n\nVillagers follow their Overworld schedules regardless of which dimension they are in.\n\nThey can sleep in the Nether or the End, without causing the usual consequences of the bed exploding (See Bed), if the Overworld's time is correct.\n\n[8] This is because the daylight cycle continues in these dimensions, even though it is not normally apparent to the player.\n\nSometimes when a villager gets in a bed from another direction they turn their body until their head is on the pillow of the bed.\n\nVillagers also sleep with their eyes open, just like players.\n\nVillagers get a brief regeneration effect once leveling up in their profession.\n\nPink regeneration particles appear when the villager is healing.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, when villagers successfully sleep, they immediately heal themselves when waking up at dawn if they are damaged.\n\nJob site blocks next to each other.\n\nAll plains biome variant professions (except unemployed) corresponding to their different job site blocks.\n\nEach villager can have a profession except for the nitwit, indicated by their clothing as well as by the title at the top of the trading interface.\n\nA villager can choose their profession by claiming a job site block.\n\nWhen they go to work, they use their daily schedule to get to their claimed job site block.\n\nSome professions, like farmers and librarians, do other things.\n\nFarmers plant crops, and librarians can inspect bookshelves.\n\nIf an adult villager does not have a profession (either they are unemployed or a nitwit), they wander instead.\n\nA job site block can be claimed only if it is unclaimed and within a village boundary with at least 1 bed.\n\nRemoval of a claimed job site block causes the owner to switch to another profession or become unemployed, provided that the villager has no prior trades with the player.\n\nIf the villager has prior trades, it keeps its profession and claims a new job site block that matches its profession if one is available.\n\nSo, once a player trades with a villager, the villager keeps its profession forever.\n\nNitwits and baby villagers cannot change their profession.\n\nIn Java Edition, villagers summoned by a spawn egg or via command / summon are always unemployed until they have claimed a job site block.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, however, villagers summoned in similar ways have a random profession [9]; their profession can be changed by a job site block, though.\n\nNovice-level villagers who have not yet traded can lose their profession and change into unemployed villagers.\n\nUnemployed adults actively seek for an unclaimed job site block and change into the corresponding profession.\n\nBelow is a table listing the various professions, along with the specific job site block that each profession requires: A nitwit bobbling its head Nitwit villagers wear robes that are green on top.\n\nThey cannot acquire a profession, trade, or gather around bells, but are still able to breed.\n\nThey are not equipped with a level stone since they cannot trade.\n\nPressing use on a nitwit in Java Edition causes it to grunt and bobble its head at the player.\n\nA nitwit must be born or spawned; no villagers change to nitwit from unemployed or a profession, and vice versa.\n\nNitwits can be found naturally or by curing naturally spawned zombie villagers.\n\nZombie villagers can also be spawned as babies, so this is the only way to encounter baby nitwits in survival mode.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, every baby villager has a 10% chance to become a nitwit when they become an adult, as well as having a different sleep schedule where they wander around the village for about 2000 ticks after other villagers go to sleep, before seeking a bed.\n\nIf they can claim a bed, they arise in the morning 2000 ticks (1 minute 40 seconds) after the rest of the village wakes up.\n\nVillagers and zombie villagers have seven skin types corresponding to the biome they spawn in.\n\nTheir appearance also varies based on their profession and their five tiers.\n\nThey show which trade tier they have unlocked by a badge of a varying material on their belt.\n\nA new tier is obtained every time a player trades with a villager and the badge appears as stone, iron, gold, emerald, and finally diamond.\n\nVillagers have different outfits depending on their biome.\n\nNaturally generated villagers take on the outfit from the biome they were spawned in.\n\nWhen breeding occurs, the outfit of the child is determined by the biome where the breeding occurs, but in Java Edition, there is a 50% chance it's inherited from the biome type of the parents (equal chance for both parents).\n\nIn case the villager's outfit is determined by biome but the biome has no specific villager type, it always becomes a plains villager.\n\nThe outfits available are: Variants Biomes \u3164\u3164 Variants Biomes Desert Badlands Eroded Badlands Wooded Badlands Desert [n 1] Plains River Beach Stony Shore Stony Peaks Birch

hat) Trades campfires and fishing items.\n\nShepherd (brown hat with white apron) Trades shears, wool, dyes, paintings, and beds.\n\nFletcher (hat with feather and quiver on the back) Trades bows, crossbows, all types of arrows (except luck), and archery ingredients.\n\nCleric (purple apron and creeper cloak) Trades magic items like ender pearls, redstone dust, glowstone dust, and other enchanting or potion ingredients.\n\nWeaponsmith (eyepatch and black apron) Trades minerals, bells, and enchanted melee weapons.\n\nThe axe enchantments are weapon related, such as sharpness or smite.\n\nArmorer (welding mask) Trades foundry items and sells chain, iron, and enchanted diamond armor tiers.\n\nToolsmith (black apron) Trades minerals, bells, and harvest tools.\n\nThe axe enchantments are tool related.\n\nLibrarian (eyeglasses and a book as a hat) Trades enchanted books, clocks, compasses, name tags, glass, ink sacs, lanterns, and book and quills.\n\nCartographer (golden monocle) Trades banners, compasses, banner patterns, papers, and various maps, including explorer maps.\n\nLeatherworker (brown apron and brown gloves) Trades scutes, rabbit hide, and leather-related items.\n\nButcher (red headband and white apron) Trades meats, sweet berries, rabbit stew, and dried kelp blocks.\n\nMason  [JE only ] / Stone Mason  [BE only ] (black apron and black gloves) Trades polished stones, terracotta, clay, glazed terracotta, and quartz.\n\nNitwit (green coated, no badge) No trades, no badge Unemployed (no overlay, base clothing of biome without any extra features) No trades until employed.\n\nNo badge until employed.\n\nMain article: Trading The Java Edition trading interface, displaying basic novice-level trading options.\n\nTrading options of a max-level weaponsmith.\n\nVillager badge changes color depending on the level of the villager.\n\nFrom left to right: stone (novice), iron (apprentice), gold (journeyman), emerald (expert), and diamond (master).\n\nThe trading system is a gameplay mechanic that allows players to buy and sell various items to and from villagers, using emeralds as a currency.\n\nTheir trades can be valuable or somewhat meaningless, depending on the cost, the items the player might get, and how the player treats the villagers.\n\nOnly adult villagers with professions can trade; the player cannot trade with nitwits, unemployed villagers, or baby villagers.\n\nAttempting to do so causes the villager to display a head-bobbling animation and play the villager's declined trade sound [Java Edition only ].\n\nUsing an employed villager allows a player to trade, making offers based on the villager's profession and profession level.\n\nAll offers involve emeralds as a currency, and items related to the villager's profession.\n\nTrading can allow the acquisition of items that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to obtain, such as enchanted books with \"treasure\" enchantments (e.g.\n\nMending), bottles o' enchanting, or chainmail armor.\n\nWhen a villager gets a new trade, they receive 10 seconds of Regeneration I (totaling to 4 of restoration), which emits pink particles.\n\nThe villager also emits green particles suggesting contentment.\n\nCompleting a trade with a villager increases its professional level.\n\nSome trades grant higher levels to the villager than others.\n\nAs it advances through its profession, the villager offers additional trades.\n\nWhen a villager unlocks a new trade at a higher level, it almost always grants more experience than lower-level trades.\n\nVillagers have a maximum supply of items and after the player has traded for an item that many times, the villager's supply of the item is exhausted.\n\nThis results in the trade being temporarily locked.\n\nA player can continue to trade for the villager's other available items if any.\n\nExhausted items are restocked when the villager works at a job site, up to twice per day.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, librarian villagers have a 50% chance to sell enchanted books as part of their trades at novice, apprentice, and journeyman-level, and have 1 \u2044 3 chance to sell enchanted books at expert-level as part of their trades, meaning each librarian villager can sell up to four books.\n\nThe price ranges between 5-64 emeralds per book.\n\nBased on the level of the enchantment and whether it is classified as a \" treasure enchantment \" (meaning they are not obtainable by enchanting, e.g.\n\nMending), which doubles the cost, or not a price is determined.\n\nIn Java Edition, librarian villagers have a 2 \u2044 3 chance to sell an enchanted book as part of their trades at the novice, apprentice, and journeyman level, and have a 50% chance to sell an enchanted book at the expert level, meaning each librarian can sell up to four books.\n\nThe price ranges from 5-64 emeralds per book, depending on the enchantment's level as well as whether or not it is a treasure enchantment.\n\nCost of Enchanted Books based on their level Level Lowest Price Highest Price I (1) 5 19 II (2) 8 32 III (3) 11 45 IV (4) 14 58 V (5) 17 71 (capped at 64) They may contain any available enchantment (except Soul Speed and Swift Sneak) at any available level.\n\nSee trading notes for more information on enchantments and prices.\n\nClicking use on an unemployed or nitwit villager in Java Edition causes it to grunt and bobble their head; doing so in Bedrock Edition does nothing.\n\nUsing a name tag on a villager always names the villager instead of opening the trading interface.\n\nFor detailed information on Villager economics, see Trading \u00a7 Economics.\n\nThe price of an item can rise and fall with changes in demand.\n\nThe price of a traded item can rise when next resupplied, or fall from a risen price if not traded.\n\nDemand is stored per item, not per villager.\n\nSeveral villagers offering trade items to a player.\n\nWhen a player holds an item near a villager who wants that item, the villager holds up an item it offers in exchange.\n\nFor example, a farmer villager who buys 20 wheat for one emerald holds up an emerald, offering it to a player holding wheat.\n\nVillagers do not offer trades that are currently out of stock.\n\nIf the villager has more than one trade for an item, it cycles through the trades, offering a different item every few seconds.\n\nThis kind of trading interaction makes it easier to find villagers who offer a particular trade, but the player must still open the trading interface to complete the trade.\n\nNote that villagers do not hold items to offer trades during their gather or sleep phases, even though it is still possible to trade with them.\n\nVillagers have levels and require experience to unlock the next tiers of trade: level 1 is a novice, level 2 is apprentice, level 3 is journeyman, level 4 is expert, and level 5 is master.\n\nVillagers can resupply trades by themselves by working more at their job site block.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, villagers increase their prices of trades if a player's popularity is low, (e.g.\n\nfrom damaging villagers), and decrease it if their popularity is high (e.g.\n\nfrom trading with multiple villagers).\n\nCuring a zombie villager also increases the player's popularity by 10.\n\nIn Java Edition, a villager's prices are affected by the player's reputation with that villager rather than by village popularity.\n\nMain article: Hero of the Village When a player receives Hero of the Village, players receive discounted prices on all the items traded by villagers in both editions.\n\nThe Hero of the Village also gets gifts. [Java Edition only ] Each villager throws gifts related to its profession, and nitwits and unemployed villagers throw wheat seeds instead.\n\nThese gifts range in value from common (like seeds) to rare items (like chainmail armor).\n\nA player's popularity increases by 10 in Java Edition and doesn't increase in Bedrock Edition.\n\nVillagers also shoot off fireworks, with different colored fireworks with no pattern.\n\nAn example of a zombie villager.\n\nMain article: Zombie Villager When a zombie kills a villager, it can turn the villager into a zombie villager, depending on the difficulty: 0% chance on Easy, 50% chance on Normal, and 100% chance on Hard.\n\nZombie villagers also spawn naturally in the Overworld in the same conditions as a normal zombie, although much less commonly, with a 5% chance.\n\nZombie villagers also spawn in abandoned villages (zombie villages) and igloos.\n\nThey do not spawn from the zombie monster spawner.\n\nA wandering trader.\n\nMain article: Wandering Trader Wandering traders are passive mobs that spawn randomly close to the player in both editions, or periodically in village gathering sites in Bedrock Edition.\n\nWandering traders also spawn near bells.\n\nTwo trader llamas spawn leashed to the wandering trader when a wandering trader is naturally spawned, and in Bedrock Edition when summoned or spawned using a spawn

never unlock the trade, nor can they work at any job site blocks.\n\nLike villagers, wandering traders are attacked by most zombie variants (though they do not have a zombified form, they die if a zombie kills it, even on hard difficulty), illagers, ravagers  [Java Edition only ], and vexes.\n\nWandering traders also drink a Potion of Invisibility at night (or when they see a hostile mob such as an illager or zombie).\n\nThey also drink a milk bucket in the morning to remove the Invisibility.\n\nThey despawn after 40 minutes (even with a name tag or in a minecart or boat) with their llamas.\n\nJava Edition: Villagers use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: \u2191 Can be multiplied by 1.0 or 0.92 for each sound

Pillage, see Villager (old) \u00a7 History.\n\nIssues relating to \"Villager\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe villagers were inspired by the shopkeepers in Dungeon Master II.\n\n[15] Originally, the mobs populating villages were to be pigmen.\n\n[16] When a villager is in love mode, it walks slowly.\n\nHowever, when a villager runs indoors as the night falls, it runs faster than the player's sprinting speed.\n\nBaby villagers taking poppies out of Iron Golem's hands is a reference to the 1986 Japanese animated movie Castle in the Sky, in which a giant robot covered in vines (inspiration for the iron golem) gives the main characters flowers to put on a memorial.\n\n[17] The villager skins added in the Village and Pillage update were inspired by 2018 fashion shows, such as Gucci's.\n\n[18] Villagers are genderless, meaning they are neither male nor female.\n\n[19] Villagers occasionally sleep in odd ways during the night inside their beds, sometimes hanging halfway off the side of the bed or even glitching into walls.\n\nAlthough the villages in snowy taiga biomes spawn the snowy villager variant in Bedrock Edition, they use the taiga village variant.\n\nIn Java Edition, when the Programmer Art resource pack is enabled, all villagers wear a green hood on their heads.\n\n[20] This is because the Programmer Art nitwit texture (which is directly copied from the pre-1.14 vanilla resource pack and had the hood in the texture since its addition) is called the same as the Village & Pillage base villager texture (...\\entity\\villager\\villager.png).\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, when the Classic Textures pack from the Marketplace is enabled, the villagers still use their default texture instead of the old texture.\n\n[21] This is because the old textures of villager are located in...\\entity\\villager, while the textures for new villagers are in...\\entity\\villager2.\n\nIn Java Edition, baby villagers are the only mobs that do not have a disproportionately large head compared to their adult counterparts.\n\nRather, they are smaller versions of the adult villager.\n\nGiving a villager any item (with commands) causes it to hold the item as if offering it, but it cannot be traded.\n\nFisherman villagers have been intentionally textured by Jasper Boerstra to display the long-since-removed raw fish texture.\n\n[22] Villagers display their held items differently than most creatures do, using the \"ground\" parameter instead of the usual hand parameter in model display settings.\n\nVillagers (and baby villagers) on boats that have claimed a bed can still sleep when the bed is near to them resulting in them sleeping in the boat instead. [Bedrock Edition only ] Ancient villagers have been shown in Minecraft Legends, although they were hinted at in Minecraft Dungeons.\n\nIn Java Edition, the death messages of villagers are recorded in the game's logs.\n\n[23] The Old Librarian villager was used by DanTDM For the character Dr Trayaurus and the Old Librarian villager became synonymous with that character Main article: Easter eggs \u00a7 2014 This feature is exclusive to Java Edition.\n\nOn April 1, 2014, Mojang announced that villagers have taken over the skin servers and content delivery networks (CDN) as an April Fools joke.\n\nThis caused the player's current skin to turn into villager skins, and caused users to be unable to change their skins unless modifying the launcher.json file.\n\nDifferent career villager skins were used, including the then-unused nitwit villager (green robe).\n\nMany of the sounds were also changed, supposedly by the villagers.\n\nThey seem to be similar to a villager talking (with words, rather than their normal sounds).\n\nThe in-game music has also been altered to include villager like noises, and also features a villager version of the \"Game of Thrones\" theme on the title screen.\n\nThe sounds originate from the sound resource pack created by Element Animation, titled The Element Animation Villager Sound Resource Pack (T.E.A.V.S.R.P.), which is based on the villagers appearing in their fan videos.\n\nThe villagers were voiced by Dan Lloyd, Director of Element Animation.\n\nThe skins and the sounds were reverted to the way they were before on April 2, 2014.\n\nHowever, this update cannot be activated by setting the computer's date to April 1, 2014.\n\nTwo villagers from a rare multi-biome village (in this case plains and desert) meeting.\n\nA

    "content": "This page describes content that exists only in outdated versions of Minecraft.\n\nThis feature used to be in the game, but has ever since been removed.It may or may not return in a future update.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to New Nintendo 3DS Edition and Legacy Console Edition.\n\nGeneric villager Farmer Librarian Priest Blacksmith Butcher Nitwit Baby Farmer Baby Librarian Baby Priest Baby Blacksmith Baby Butcher Baby Nitwit Health 20 \u00d7 10 Behavior Passive Spawn see \u00a7Spawning Details Size Adult: Height: 1.95 Blocks Width: 0.6 Blocks Baby: Height: 0.975 Blocks Width: 0.3 Blocks Generic villagers were passive mobs that inhabit villages, with different professions, breed, and interact.\n\nTheir clothing varied according to their occupation.\n\nA player could trade with villagers, using emeralds as currency.\n\nThey were replaced with a revamped version of themselves in the Village & Pillage update.\n\nIn Java Edition, old villagers can only spawn in versions of Minecraft prior to 1.14.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, old villagers can only spawn if they existed from a template world prior to 1.11.0, and any old villager spawned after 1.11.0 outside a template world will be converted into villager_v2.\n\nVillagers will breed autonomously, but need doors and need to be willing in order to spawn baby villagers.\n\nAfter exactly 20 minutes during which the baby villager is within render distance, the baby villager will grow up to an adult.\n\nSee this section for more information.\n\nVillagers will spawn if a player uses a splash potion of weakness on a v1 zombie villager in template world and then feeds it a regular golden apple.\n\nIt will then shake and turn into a villager within 0-5 minutes.\n\nDuring the change, the zombie villager can still burn in the sun.\n\nVillagers drop nothing upon death.\n\nTrade: 3\u20136 xp Trade while willing: 8\u201311 xp Upon spawning, villagers will leave their homes and begin to explore the village.\n\nGenerally, they wander aimlessly inside the village during the day.\n\nThey may go indoors or outdoors, and they periodically make mumbling sounds.\n\nOccasionally, two villagers may stop and turn to look at each other, in a behavior called socializing, in which they will stare at another villager for 4-5 seconds at a time.\n\nIn the case of players, they will continuously stare at them as long as the player is close enough, unless the villager tries to get into a house at night, farm food, or flee from a zombie.\n\nIn Legacy Console Edition, when a player attacks a villager, the villager will not run away, but anger particles will fly out from the villager if it is in a village.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, villagers do not stop continuously in front of players.\n\nThey will also sprint away if the player attacks them.\n\nVillagers, like other mobs, will find paths around obstructions, avoiding walking off cliffs and some blocks that cause harm.\n\nHowever, in crowded situations it is possible for one villager to push another off a cliff or into harm.\n\nVillagers also occasionally walk off of ledges high enough to cause fall damage.\n\nAt night or during rain, villagers will run inside, closing doors behind them, and staying indoors until morning.\n\nIn the morning they will head outside and resume normal behavior.\n\nVillagers will run away from zombies, illagers and vexes within 8 blocks.\n\nIf a villager finds itself outside the village boundary, or a villager without a village detects a village boundary within 32 blocks, it will move quickly back within the boundary.\n\nA villager taken more than 32 blocks away from its village boundary will forget the village within about 6 seconds.\n\nWhether in a village or not, a villager is never prone to despawning.\n\nVillagers cannot open trapdoors, fence gates, or iron doors.\n\nThere is evidence that villagers are prone to overcrowding certain areas of a village while leaving other areas completely empty.\n\nWhen moving inside, the AI prefers doors within 16 blocks (Euclidean distance).\n\nIt also tends to prefer doors with fewer villagers nearby, however \"nearby\" in this case is only 1.5 blocks and, when moving inside, villagers prefer to move 2.5 blocks inside when the inside is to the south or east and therefore will be out of range of this check.\n\nDuring the day, it has been observed that villagers will tend to cluster near a trapped villager or any existing large cluster of villagers, likely due to the \"socialize\" AI routine overriding their inclination to wander.\n\nVillagers have eight hidden inventory slots, which start empty whenever the villager is spawned.\n\nVillagers will not intentionally seek out items to pick up, but they will collect any bread, carrots, potatoes, wheat, seeds, beetroot and beetroot seeds they happen to come within range of.\n\nThese are the only items they are able to pick up, though the player may use the / replaceitem command to put an arbitrary item into a villager's inventory.\n\nIf a player and a villager are in the pickup range of an item at the same time, the player will always pick it up first.\n\nEven when gamerule keepInventory is set to false, villagers that are killed with any of the available items above will not drop them once they are killed.\n\nAny items in these slots are lost if a villager becomes a zombie villager; a zombie villager has no inventory slots.\n\nIf / gamerule mobGriefing is false, villagers will not pick up items.\n\nA dispenser can be used, if adjacent to a villager, to place armor on it.\n\nWhile not visible in most cases (other than pumpkins and mob heads) the equipment will be fully functional; for example, the Thorns enchantment will hurt zombies that attack a villager with a piece of armor enchanted with the Thorns enchantment equipped.\n\nIf a villager has enough food in one inventory stack (6 bread or 24 carrots, potatoes, beetroots, or 18 wheat for farmers only) and sees a villager without enough food in one inventory stack (3 bread or 12 carrots, potatoes or beetroot for non-farmers; 15 bread, 60 carrots, potatoes, or beetroot, or 45 wheat for Farmers), the villager may decide to share food with that villager.\n\nTo share, a villager finds his first inventory stack with at least 4 bread, carrots, potatoes, or beetroot or with at least 6 wheat, and then throws half the stack (rounded down) in the direction of the target villager.\n\nWhen wheat is shared, it is first crafted to bread which may result in 1 or 2 less than half the stack being shared.\n\nAdult and baby brown-robed villagers, both farmers and other careers, will tend crops within the village boundary.\n\nVillagers far enough outside the boundary of any village will also tend nearby crops.\n\nFarmland to be tended is found by seeking for certain blocks up to 15 blocks away from the villager in X and Z and up to 1 away in Y (a 31\u00d731\u00d73 area total).\n\nIf a brown-robed villager does not have enough food in one stack in its inventory (15 bread, 60 carrots, potatoes, or beetroot, or 45 wheat) and finds fully-grown wheat, carrots, potatoes or beetroot, it will move to the crop block and break it.\n\nIf a brown-robed villager has any seeds, carrots, potatoes, or beetroot seeds in its inventory and finds an air block above farmland, it will move to it and plant a crop.\n\nThey will always plant from the first eligible slot in their inventory.\n\nIf / gamerule mobGriefing is false, villagers will not be able to farm.\n\nA group of baby villagers playing a game of tag.\n\nBaby villagers will sprint around, entering and leaving houses at will.\n\nThey will sometimes stop sprinting to stare at an iron golem.\n\nIf the iron golem is holding a poppy, it might attract any baby villagers near it.\n\nBaby villagers in Bedrock / Legacy Console Editions have a slightly bigger head than in the Java Edition, this also can be seen in different baby mobs in the game as well.\n\nUnlike other breed-able mobs, the parents and child have no personal interactions other than socializing.\n\nMain articles: Siege and Zombie Zombies will try to find and attack villagers within a 42 block radius (even when the villager is invisible), and will attempt to break down doors.\n\nZombies will only successfully break doors if the difficulty is set to hard, though only a fraction of zombies spawned in hard mode have the capacity to break doors.\n\nThis also applies to zombie pigmen if they path find through a door.\n\nVillagers will run away from zombies, sometimes hiding in houses.\n\nThe villager's only \"natural\" defense are the iron golems, which attack nearby hostile mobs.\n\nZombies will try to kill villagers, or convert them to v1 zombie villagers.\n\nThe chance that the villager will become a zombie villager on death is 0% on Easy, 50% on Normal, and 100% on Hard.\n\nBaby villagers can be infected by zombies as well.\n\nVillagers will also run from zombie pigmen, though the latter will not attack them.\n\nDrowned will chase and attack villagers in the same way zombies will, and villagers will run from drowned in the same way they run from zombies.\n\nDrowned can also convert villagers to zombie villagers, even when attacking from a distance with a trident.\n\nWhen lightning strikes within 3\u20134 blocks of a villager, it will turn into a witch.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Legacy Console village mechanics Two villagers mating.\n\nVillagers will mate depending on the number of valid doors.\n\nIf \"willing\" (see below), villagers will mate as long as the population is less than 35% (Bedrock Edition: 100%) of valid doors, rounded down.\n\nThe type of villager that spawns is independent of the villager's parents.\n\nA valid door is any door within the village radius where the number of \"outside\" spaces within 5 blocks in a straight line on one side of the door is not the same as the number of \"outside\" spaces within 5 blocks on the other side of the door.\n\nA space is considered to be \"outside\" if it has nothing but transparent blocks above it all the way to the sky.\n\nA census is periodically taken to determine the current population of the village.\n\nAll villagers within the horizontal boundary of the village and within 5 vertical blocks (Bedrock Edition: no apparent height limit) of the center will be counted as part of the population to determine if continued villager mating is allowed.\n\nHowever, any villager within the horizontal boundary of the village and within the spherical boundary of the village will attempt to enter mating mode as long as there is at least one villager within the boundary.\n\nIf two villagers simultaneously enter mating mode while they are close to one another, they will mate with each other and produce a child.\n\nAdditionally, villagers must be \"willing\" in order to breed.\n\nAfter mating, they will no longer be willing, and must be made willing again.\n\nVillagers can become willing by having either 3 bread, 12 carrots, 12 potatoes, or 12 beetroots in one stack in their inventory.\n\nAny villager with an excess of food (usually farmers) will throw food to other villagers, allowing them to pick it up and obtain enough food to become willing.\n\nThe player can also throw bread, carrots, beetroots, or potatoes at the villagers themselves to encourage breeding.\n\nVillagers will consume the required food upon becoming willing.\n\nVillagers may also become willing when the player trades with them.\n\nWillingness is granted the first time a new offer is traded, or at a one-in-five chance on subsequent trades.\n\nMost of the time, villagers becomes willing after the second or third trade.\n\nGreen particles will appear if the villager becomes willing by trading.\n\nThis will not cause them to immediately seek out a mate, however.\n\nBefore Java Edition 1.8, willingness was not implemented.\n\nThe only factor needed is enough valid doors.\n\nEach villager has a profession, which can be identified by their clothing.\n\nVillagers also have careers specific to their profession.\n\nThe player can identify a villager's career by reading the title at the top of the trading interface.\n\nBelow is a table listing the various villagers, with their careers in relation to their professions, as well as the IDs specifying these.\n\nWhile each profession has a 1 in 6 chance (16.67%) of occurring, the probabilities for individual careers to occur are more diversified.\n\nThey are listed in the table as well.\n\nWhen a villager is transformed into a zombie villager, the profession of the zombie villager will remain unchanged.\n\nHowever, the career will be reset and randomly picked again if the zombie villager is cured, allowing for the player to get a villager with a new career and new trade offers.\n\nOld trade offers will disappear, even if the same career is chosen again.\n\n\u201c It started because players could summon villagers without a career by using commands: it was the only way to get villagers with green robes.\n\nWhenever we discover we have a bug which is used by the community we just see it as 'undefined behaviour' - and 'fix' it by making it a feature.\n\nIn this case we just needed a profession for the green-robed villager.\n\nI don't remember what name we came up with first - I think it was 'unemployed' or something, but it doesn't really fit in the world, because I don't really think the other villagers are employed by anyone either.\n\nSo I think the next suggestion was 'village idiot' but I thought 'nitwit' was a more fun name.\n\n\u201e \u2014 Jeb about the Nitwit [1] The nitwit villager is a villager that wears a green robe and cannot be traded with.\n\nMain article: Trading/Before Village and Pillage The pre-1.14 trading interface displaying a trade of 35 paper for 1 emerald.\n\n\u201c Right click on a villager and you can trade with them, offering them emeralds in exchange for better equipment, maps to notable treasures or food.\n\nUnless you are trying to trade with a nitwit, of course, in which case you're going to get squat.\n\nWho's the nitwit now?\n\n\u201e \u2014 Marsh Davies [2] The trading system is a gameplay mechanic that allows players to trade emeralds for items and vice-versa with villagers.\n\nTheir trades can be good or bad, depending on what the cost is and what items you might get.\n\nTrading is only available for adult villagers; the player cannot trade with baby villagers or the nitwit villager.\n\nRight-clicking a villager will allow a player to trade with them, and display their career.\n\nVillagers will make offers based on their profession and career, and will only make trades based on whatever offers they are making.\n\nDifferent offers may be viewed by pressing the left and right buttons next to the currently displayed offer.\n\nAll offers involve emerald as a currency, and some item pertinent to the villager's profession and career.\n\nTrading allows the acquisition of rare items that would otherwise be fairly difficult to obtain, such as chain armor.\n\nThe trading mechanic allows players to get bottle o' enchanting in survival mode.\n\nWhen villagers get a new trade, pink particles and green cross particles appear.\n\nAfter trading a new offer once, the villager will allow a new tier of offers.\n\nAfter 2-12 times an offer is repeated, the villager will lock the trade offer.\n\nThat is, the villager will no longer offer this trade.\n\nWhen this happens, the player will have to use another new trade offer in the villager's window once (or several times if it is already used once), and then wait for a short time.\n\nIf green particles appear, all trades unlock.\n\nThat is, the villager will start offering all trades.\n\nThere is a maximum number of tiers each villager can possess, varying by career.\n\nOnce the villager has unlocked all tiers, it will not open any new ones.\n\nHowever, players will still be able to renew all offers by trading.\n\nWhen a villager gives off particles from a new trade, they get 10 seconds of Regeneration I, which gives them 4.\n\nCommands or external editors can help villagers get new trades.\n\nIf a villager unintentionally picks up certain seeds or crops, it will throw it to another villager to simulate trading between the villagers.\n\nJava Edition: Villagers used the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: \u2191 MCPE-113788 Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: See also: Chunk format Villagers have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nEntity data

and content delivery networks (CDN) as an April Fools joke.\n\nThis caused players' current skin to turn into villager skins.\n\nThis also caused users to be unable to change their skins.\n\nDifferent career villager skins were used, including the then-unused nitwit villager (green robe).\n\nMany of the sounds were also changed, supposedly by the villagers.\n\nThey seem to be similar to a villager talking (with words, rather than their normal sounds).\n\nThe in-game music has also been altered to include villager like noises, and also features a villager version of the \"Game of Thrones\" theme

[BE only ] When attacked by a player, a wandering trader flees from the player as a villager would do.\n\nThe llamas, however, attack the player by spitting if their master gets hit, except in Peaceful.\n\nThe llamas stop attacking if the player is killed and respawns, if the llamas are leashed after the wandering trader is killed, or if the player gets far enough away from them for a short period of time.\n\nDespite their similarities to villagers, attacking or killing wandering traders does not anger iron golems.\n\n[3] Unlike most other villager-like mobs, wandering traders do not visually sit down when riding objects such as boats and minecarts.\n\n[4] The trading UI of a wandering trader in Java Edition.\n\nFor the available trades for the wandering trader, see Trading \u00a7 Wandering trader.\n\nThe trading system is a gameplay mechanic that allows players to buy items with emeralds, but from a wandering trader this time.\n\nA player can click on the wandering trader to view the items offered for sale, similar to a villager.\n\nDifferent offers are visible in a list, and clicking on one of the offers moves the corresponding items to the slots above the player's inventory.\n\nAll offers involve emeralds as a currency.\n\nWandering traders typically sell items generated in the world or otherwise related to nature, such as plants, dyes, and buckets of fish.\n\nThey can also trade less common items, such as coral blocks, blue ice, or nautilus shells.\n\nOverall, trades offered by wandering traders offer a way to obtain biome-specific materials, without having to travel to the specific biomes.\n\nAfter the player purchases the same item several times, the wandering trader locks the trade, but unlike villagers, never unlocks the trade.\n\nThe wandering trader can appear again around the player with new trades after a while.\n\nWandering traders do not have the novice-master trading system like villagers.\n\nInstead, the player can buy anything from the wandering trader without the need of unlocking the previous trades.\n\nWandering traders do not increase or decrease the prices of its items being sold if attacked by the player, or if the player has the Hero of the Village effect.\n\nUnlike villagers, wandering traders only sell items, they do not buy items.\n\nWandering traders do not have an experience bar and do not modify their offers or prices based on changing demand.\n\nThis (the trade items or prices) can be changed by the player by editing the corresponding NBT data flag through the use of the / data  [JE only ] command.\n\nWandering traders are the only renewable source of sand, red sand, coral blocks, and small dripleaves.\n\nThe wandering trader cannot work at a job site block and restock, even summoned with a villager profession or other villager data.\n\nA milk bucket (8.5% chance, increased 1% per level of Looting) if killed while holding or before finishing drinking.\n\nA potion of invisibility (8.5% chance, increased 1% per level of Looting) if killed while holding or before finishing drinking.\n\nA wandering trader is also a source of leads, as it typically spawns with two leashed trader llamas.\n\nThese leads break and drop (at the location of the llama) if either trader or llama dies or if they are separated.\n\nWandering traders do not drop any loot when they despawn.\n\nWandering traders do not reward any experience when killed or when the player successfully trades with the wandering trader.\n\nJava Edition: Wandering traders use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 The first listed sound is 0.35;

    "content": "This article documents an April Fools' joke.\n\nThere is no actual Java Edition 2.0 version of Minecraft in development.\n\nMinecraft 2.0 Edition Java Edition Release date April 1, 2013 Downloads Blue [note 1] Client (.json) Server Red [note 2] Client (.json) Server Purple [note 3] Client (.json) Server Protocol version Blue: 90 Red: 91 Purple: 92 15w14a \u25ba \u25ba Super Hostile Mode.\n\nOn April 1, 2013, Mojang released a hoax announcement for Minecraft 2.0, a new game they had supposedly been working on for two years, describing how it would \"bring blocky simulation games to the next level.\" The post also contained a changelog comprised mostly of nonsensical changes, such as a new slab of TNT called the Etho slab, and the addition of coal blocks (which did not exist at the time).\n\nAlthough lacking most of the promised additions, Minecraft 2.0 was produced and distributed to select celebrity individuals [1] to showcase to the public as part of the joke.\n\nMinecraft 2.0 is a fork of 1.5.1, and is the only joke release not available through the Minecraft launcher.\n\nDespite being a joke, some features added in this version were implemented in subsequent updates.\n\nThis section needs cleanup to comply with the style guide.\n\n[discuss ] Please help improve this page.\n\nThe talk page may contain suggestions.\n\nEtho Slab The data value is 160, although a variant with ID 159 (double Etho slab) also exists.\n\nCan be crafted with 3 TNT: Much like other slabs, it can be placed on the lower or upper half of a block.\n\nIt has the same functions as a normal TNT; however, when it explodes, it spawns an anvil over entities in the explosion's range, including Players.\n\nThis and the block's name are references to EthosLab, a Minecraft YouTuber who often tries to kill players with falling anvils.\n\nTorch (Burnt-out) The data value is 161.\n\nTorches now burn out after a random amount of ticks.\n\nThey can be relit with flint and steel.\n\nBurnt-out torches were originally supposed to be added in the Halloween Update, where lanterns were supposed to be the new light source.\n\nHowever, this feature wasn't added to the Halloween Update before release and was later officially rejected.\n\nBlock of Coal The data value is 162.\n\nJust like the other mineral blocks, it is crafted with 3\u00d73 coal: However, when it is put into the crafting table to get back the coal, the coal obtained is not stackable with other coal, because it has a different item data value: 32767 instead of 0.\n\nThis is likely an intentional bug.\n\nThis block was later added into Minecraft in Java Edition 1.6.1 with the same texture as from the April Fools version, but it was later retextured.\n\nTinted Glass Has a data value of 163.\n\nIs opaque.\n\nGlass can be dyed any color that the dye exists for, and yields 8 tinted glass of the corresponding color: Contains block data values ranging from 0\u201315 that specify the color of the glass.\n\nWool's block data values produce the same colors when used on tinted glass.\n\nIn Java Edition 1.7.2, tinted glass was added to the game under the name stained glass.\n\nAt its first introduction, 13w41a, it used the 2.0 textures, but it was changed in the next snapshot, 13w42a.\n\nIn Java Edition 1.17, tinted glass was added.\n\nIt is unlikely that the identical naming of these blocks was intentional.\n\nEtho slab Torch (Burnt-out) Block of Coal Tinted Glasses The pink wither compared to the regular wither.\n\nA large swarm of redstone bugs.\n\n\"Horses\", \"Ponies\" Textures are called pig_horse, and cow_horse.\n\nThese \"horses\" and \"ponies\" can sometimes be obtained when cows or pigs are spawned with spawn eggs.\n\nThey follow a player holding an apple or sugar, but they breed like normal horses.\n\nPink wither Main article: Pink Wither Attracted to sugar, restores health to all surrounding mobs, and applies bone meal to all eligible neighboring blocks.\n\nIt also has the ability to grow roses, dandelions, grass and ferns on grass blocks, due to the bone meal.\n\nStarts off with one head.\n\nFeeding it sugar grows another head (up to three) and increase the range of these effects.\n\nPink withers are spawned by placing pink wool, with a flower pot containing a rose on top.\n\nJust like their evil counterpart, they drop nether

April Fools snapshot.\n\nDiamond chickens Main article: Diamond Chicken Rarely spawns instead of a normal chicken.\n\nLays diamonds or lapis lazuli, or explodes instead of laying eggs.\n\nRedstone bug

only heavily armed and armored zombies and skeletons, and multiple charged creepers, but even the occasional blaze and other monsters that don't usually spawn in the Overworld.\n\nThis is a reference to Vechs' Super Hostile series of maps.\n\nAll of these are apparently triggered by \"punching wood\" or crafting anything.\n\nNaturally, these are some of the first things a Survival player needs to

    "content": "This article documents an April Fools' joke.\n\nThere is no actual Java Edition 2.0 version of Minecraft in development.\n\nMinecraft 2.0 Edition Java Edition Release date April 1, 2013 Downloads Blue [note 1] Client (.json) Server Red [note 2] Client (.json) Server Purple [note 3] Client (.json) Server Protocol version Blue: 90 Red: 91 Purple: 92 15w14a \u25ba \u25ba Super Hostile Mode.\n\nOn April 1, 2013, Mojang released a hoax announcement for Minecraft 2.0, a new game they had supposedly been working on for two years, describing how it would \"bring blocky simulation games to the next level.\" The post also contained a changelog comprised mostly of nonsensical changes, such as a new slab of TNT called the Etho slab, and the addition of coal blocks (which did not exist at the time).\n\nAlthough lacking most of the promised additions, Minecraft 2.0 was produced and distributed to select celebrity individuals [1] to showcase to the public as part of the joke.\n\nMinecraft 2.0 is a fork of 1.5.1, and is the only joke release not available through the Minecraft launcher.\n\nDespite being a joke, some features added in this version were implemented in subsequent updates.\n\nThis section needs cleanup to comply with the style guide.\n\n[discuss ] Please help improve this page.\n\nThe talk page may contain suggestions.\n\nEtho Slab The data value is 160, although a variant with ID 159 (double Etho slab) also exists.\n\nCan be crafted with 3 TNT: Much like other slabs, it can be placed on the lower or upper half of a block.\n\nIt has the same functions as a normal TNT; however, when it explodes, it spawns an anvil over entities in the explosion's range, including Players.\n\nThis and the block's name are references to EthosLab, a Minecraft YouTuber who often tries to kill players with falling anvils.\n\nTorch (Burnt-out) The data value is 161.\n\nTorches now burn out after a random amount of ticks.\n\nThey can be relit with flint and steel.\n\nBurnt-out torches were originally supposed to be added in the Halloween Update, where lanterns were supposed to be the new light source.\n\nHowever, this feature wasn't added to the Halloween Update before release and was later officially rejected.\n\nBlock of Coal The data value is 162.\n\nJust like the other mineral blocks, it is crafted with 3\u00d73 coal: However, when it is put into the crafting table to get back the coal, the coal obtained is not stackable with other coal, because it has a different item data value: 32767 instead of 0.\n\nThis is likely an intentional bug.\n\nThis block was later added into Minecraft in Java Edition 1.6.1 with the same texture as from the April Fools version, but it was later retextured.\n\nTinted Glass Has a data value of 163.\n\nIs opaque.\n\nGlass can be dyed any color that the dye exists for, and yields 8 tinted glass of the corresponding color: Contains block data values ranging from 0\u201315 that specify the color of the glass.\n\nWool's block data values produce the same colors when used on tinted glass.\n\nIn Java Edition 1.7.2, tinted glass was added to the game under the name stained glass.\n\nAt its first introduction, 13w41a, it used the 2.0 textures, but it was changed in the next snapshot, 13w42a.\n\nIn Java Edition 1.17, tinted glass was added.\n\nIt is unlikely that the identical naming of these blocks was intentional.\n\nEtho slab Torch (Burnt-out) Block of Coal Tinted Glasses The pink wither compared to the regular wither.\n\nA large swarm of redstone bugs.\n\n\"Horses\", \"Ponies\" Textures are called pig_horse, and cow_horse.\n\nThese \"horses\" and \"ponies\" can sometimes be obtained when cows or pigs are spawned with spawn eggs.\n\nThey follow a player holding an apple or sugar, but they breed like normal horses.\n\nPink wither Main article: Pink Wither Attracted to sugar, restores health to all surrounding mobs, and applies bone meal to all eligible neighboring blocks.\n\nIt also has the ability to grow roses, dandelions, grass and ferns on grass blocks, due to the bone meal.\n\nStarts off with one head.\n\nFeeding it sugar grows another head (up to three) and increase the range of these effects.\n\nPink withers are spawned by placing pink wool, with a flower pot containing a rose on top.\n\nJust like their evil counterpart, they drop nether stars.\n\nIt is still classified as a hostile mob, though its behavior is not hostile.\n\nThe pink wither is also considered undead, and is hurt by potions of Healing and healed by potions of Harming.\n\nUnlike the normal wither the pink wither can't fly and has no health bar.\n\nIn the version.jar file the texture is named wither_pink.\n\nPink withers were also seen in 15w14a, another April Fools snapshot.\n\nDiamond chickens Main article: Diamond Chicken Rarely spawns instead of a normal chicken.\n\nLays diamonds or lapis lazuli, or explodes instead of laying eggs.\n\nRedstone bug Main article: Redstone Bug Has the appearance of a silverfish, but with a shade of red that is the same as the redstone they spawned over.\n\nSame behavior as silverfish.\n\nSpawns when a redstone error is activated, on the spot of the error.\n\nDiamond Chicken Redstone Bug (silverfish) Horse (cow) Pony (pig) Pink Wither Dropper Has been renamed to floppers.\n\nChange anything they drop to a raw fish.\n\nFurnace Has a new NBT tag Heat that can reach from 0 to 700.\n\nThe tag increases every tick the furnace is lit with a 50% probability.\n\nIt decreases with a 25% probability every tick it is not lit.\n\nThe furnace has a higher chance of spawning a large smoke particle the higher the Heat tag is.\n\nWhen Heat reaches 700 the furnace has a 25% chance of exploding every tick.\n\nThe explosion has a power of 5 and creates fire.\n\nTorches Burn out over time, turning into burnt-out torches.\n\nThey can be relighted with flint and steel.\n\nChicken Are now a neutral mob, and spawn reinforcements with a 25% probability when killed.\n\nThey also attack when the player looks at them.\n\nThis can be prevented by wearing a pumpkin.\n\nThey have an attack strength of 4.\n\nPigs, Mooshrooms, Cows, Sheeps and Chickens.\n\nNew NBT tag Fatness with a default value of 0.\n\nIncreases every time they are fed with the item to breed them.\n\nThe size of body increases except for chickens.\n\nWhen the Fatness reaches 10 or higher the animal explodes without destroying any blocks.\n\nThey drop up to two times their Fatness items.\n\nSheep Using a golden apple makes them fly.\n\nZombie Pigmen Now carry \"Battle signs \".\n\nMobs \"Super Hostile Mode\" is an occasional event (every 2\u20135 minutes on Purple version).\n\nConsisting of a shower of lightning bolts around the player (and usually striking the player at least once), while spawning a large number of powerful monsters in the area and applying the Blindness status to the player.\n\nThese spawns include not only heavily armed and armored zombies and skeletons, and multiple charged creepers, but even the occasional blaze and other monsters that don't usually spawn in the Overworld.\n\nThis is a reference to Vechs' Super Hostile series of maps.\n\nAll of these are apparently triggered by \"punching wood\" or crafting anything.\n\nNaturally, these are some of the first things a Survival player needs to do.\n\nOptions There is a new option for Super HD Graphics.\n\nWhen this option is turned on, it makes all textures monochrome except for recolored/secondary layer textures, such as grass side overlay or the colored glass.\n\nSuper HD Graphics mode does not, however, make the game more laggy or glitchy.\n\nSpeech bubbles Blocks and mobs can have speech bubbles containing text above their heads, simulating talking.\n\nAll quotes: \"That hurts:(\", \"My eye!\", \"..zzZZZ\", \"Why!?\", \"I'll be back!\", \"You didn't....\", \"Oof\", \"(&%!@*#&%!@$#\", \"Ouch\", \"Hi there!\", \"That tickles\",

Width: 1.7 blocks Adult (sitting): Height: 0.945 blocks Width: 1.7 blocks Baby: Height: 1.1875 blocks Width: 0.85 blocks Baby (sitting): Height: 0.4725 blocks Width: 0.85 blocks A camel is a passive mob found in desert villages that can be saddled and ridden by up to two players at once.\n\nA camel is tall enough that its riders cannot be reached from the ground by a few melee-attacking harmful mobs, who do not attack the camel.\n\nA camel spawns in the center of each desert village during world generation.\n\nThey do not respawn if they are killed.\n\n1\u20133 experience orbs drop when camels are killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nA saddle is dropped if the camel was already equipped with one.\n\nUpon successful breeding, 1\u20137 is dropped.\n\nKilling a baby camel yields neither items nor experience.\n\nA camel wanders aimlessly, avoiding hazards and obstacles or it sits for two to seven seconds, before eventually getting up.\n\nCamels immediately get up and flee after being harmed.\n\nA seated camel cannot be pushed by players or mobs.\n\n[1] Sitting camels do not stand up if there are solid blocks above them, as doing so would cause them to take suffocation damage immediately after.\n\nCamels are healed by 2 health points each time they are fed a cactus.\n\nCamels also heal on their own over time slowly.\n\nDespite the fact they are bred with cacti, touching a cactus block still harms camels like any other mob.\n\nA camel sitting in a desert village.\n\nCamels have the unique ability to step up 1.5 block-high walls, unlike other mounts such as horses, which can automatically step up one block without jumping.\n\nThis allows camels to step onto fences and walls, among other things.\n\nMain article: Riding Camels can be ridden by players.\n\nUp to two players can ride one camel.\n\nWhile riding, the player in the back seat cannot hurt the player driving or the camel itself.\n\nCamels have one slot in their inventory, to put a Saddle on it.\n\nA saddle can be placed on a camel by holding it and then using it on the camel, or by accessing its inventory.\n\nA camel's inventory can be accessed by mounting the camel and using inventory control, or by sneaking and then using or pressing the \"open inventory\" button [Bedrock Edition only ] on the camel.\n\nOnce a camel is saddled, the player can control it with standard directional controls, jump, and the mouse.\n\nThe player dismounts using the dismount control.\n\nLike riding other entities, it is impossible for a player to use a nether portal or end portal while on a camel.\n\nCamels cannot float on water when being controlled by a player.\n\nThey can be ridden in water up to 3 blocks deep.\n\nIn deeper water, the player is automatically dismounted.\n\n[2] Several husks trying to attack Efe.\n\nCamels walk slowly and can sprint.\n\nSaddled camels also have the ability of \"dashing charging\".\n\nWhen the player rides them, the experience bar on HUD is replaced by a dash charging bar.\n\nDashing is done using the jump control, and holding the control charges for a longer dashing.\n\nCamels can dash every 2.75 seconds.\n\nWhen dashing, the camel launches up to 12 blocks forward and one block upward.\n\nFor a short time after dashing, the camel cannot sprint.\n\nCamels are tall enough that most melee hostile mobs such as zombies, vindicators, hoglins, silverfish, endermites and golden sword -wielding piglins cannot reach players to attack them.\n\nSpiders, wolves, slimes and magma cubes can attack because they jump or climb while attacking.\n\nMost mobs never deliberately attack camels under any circumstance, even to reach players riding one; the only exceptions are mobs that attack all other mobs, these being zoglins and vindicators named \"Johnny\".\n\nMain article: Breeding A camel follows the player who holds a cactus but stops following the player if it is separated from the player by at least 10 blocks [Java Edition only ] / 16 blocks [Bedrock Edition only ].\n\nSitting camels do not follow the player.\n\nAdult camels enter love mode and breed to create baby camels after they are each given a cactus.\n\nThe parents have a cooldown of five minutes before they can breed again.\n\nThe growth time that baby camels take to be an adult camel can be reduced by giving the baby camel cactus.\n\nJava Edition: Camels use the

camels are specifically based on the one-humped dromedary camel, though the first model was based on the two-humped Bactrian camel.\n\n[11] The camel is the tallest passive mob in Minecraft, being 2.375 blocks tall, and is the only passive mob with a height greater than 2 blocks.\n\nIt is also the largest passive mob in terms of hitbox size, with a volume of 6.86375 m 3.\n\nIn comparison, the

One untamed black cat generates alongside a witch inside swamp huts upon world generation.\n\nThis cat never despawns.\n\nAdditional cats can spawn within the hut similarly to witches; for this to happen, there must be grass blocks present inside the bounding box of the swamp hut.\n\nIn Java Edition, any other cats to spawn within the swamp hut (from spawn eggs and commands without cat type set) always spawn as black.\n\nA new cat does not spawn in a hut if there is already a cat within a 16\u00d78\u00d716 block volume. [Java Edition only ] [verify ] 25% of cats spawn as kittens.\n\nDuring a full moon, 50% of cats that spawn are black.\n\nAdult cats drop: 0\u20132 string.\n\nThis drop is not affected by Looting.\n\n[1] 1\u20133 when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nUpon successful breeding, 1\u20137 is dropped.\n\nLike other baby animals, killing a kitten yields no item or experience.\n\nThis page would benefit from the addition of more images.\n\nPlease remove this notice once you've added suitable images to the article.\n\nThe specific instructions are: Baby Siamese during 21w11a.\n\n11 cat variants (from left to right): Tabby, Black, White, Persian, Ragdoll, Calico, Siamese, Red, Tuxedo, Jellie and British shorthair.\n\nThe unused tamed gray tabby texture in Bedrock Edition.\n\n[2] Baby version.\n\nDespite sharing the same model, cats are smaller than ocelots.\n\nThere are currently 11 skins that cats can have.\n\nOne of the cat skins was designed after Jellie, the late cat of YouTuber GoodTimesWithScar, and was chosen by the community in a Twitter vote.\n\n[3] The current skins are: Black (black with orange eyes) British Shorthair (silver with yellow eyes) Calico (orange, white and dark brown with yellow and blue eyes) Jellie (gray and white with gray-green eyes) Persian (creamy with blue eyes and flat faces) Ragdoll (white and soft amber with blue eyes) Red (orange and white with green eyes) Siamese (white and pale brown with blue eyes) Tabby (brown and white with yellow eyes) Tuxedo (black and white with green eyes) White (white with light blue and yellow eyes) In the default resource pack, a texture file for a tamed gray tabby exists. [BE only ] [2] It is however completely unused and cannot be spawned in-game.\n\nLike tamed wolves, tamed cats also have a collar on their necks.\n\nThe color of the cat's collar is red when tamed and can be changed by using dyes.\n\nCats are immune to fall damage, but they still avoid falling off cliffs high enough to normally cause fall damage.\n\nCats can see players even if they have the Invisibility status effect.\n\nWith the exception of a faster movement rate, kittens have the same behavior as adults.\n\nThey hiss at phantoms that are currently pursuing a player. [JE only ] Creepers and phantoms avoid cats, even while pursuing a player, keeping a distance of 6 and 16 blocks away respectively from any cats.\n\nHowever, a creeper that has begun its detonation does not flee unless the player leaves its blast radius.\n\nA stray cat is an untamed cat.\n\nNaturally spawned cats always spawn as stray cats.\n\nUnlike untamed wolves, stray cats may despawn naturally.\n\nThey pursue and attack rabbits and baby turtles up to a distance of 15 blocks.\n\nEven though they spawn in villages, they don't necessarily remain there; instead, they explore.\n\nThey sprint away from any player within 7 blocks (unless the player is sneaking [BE only ] or difficulty is set to peaceful [JE only ]), and avoid players within 16 blocks.\n\nHowever, they slowly approach a player holding raw cod or salmon within 10 blocks, allowing the player to feed and tame it (see \u00a7 Taming below).\n\nIf the player turns too quickly or stops holding the fish within 6 blocks, the cat flees and does not attempt to approach the player for a few seconds.\n\nStray cats can be leashed.\n\nCats sitting on a lime bed.\n\nUnless commanded to sit (see Taming below), tamed cats do not remain still for long and explore around the player.\n\nA cat not already sitting attempts to get on top of chests, the foot part of beds, or active furnaces at the cat's current Y-level within a 4-block-radius square horizontally, and once on top often assumes a sitting position without a command from the player.\n\nA cat also occasionally attempts to sit on these blocks if the blocks are at ground level.\n\nA chest with a cat sitting on top of it becomes unusable unless the cat is commanded to stand.\n\nCats that sit on their own can be ordered to stand, or they may get up if the player holds a raw fish nearby.\n\nThe cat can also be brought down by removing the block or pushing it off.\n\nA cat can also be forcibly moved by attacking it.\n\nA cat does not sit on a block that is obstructed by another block above it.\n\nLike other mobs, cats enter nearby boats, trapping themselves.\n\nIf a player is harmed by a hostile mob or a harming potion, but not by environmental damage, a cat sitting in proximity to the player stands, moves a few blocks from its sitting location and then resumes sitting.\n\nWhen the player sleeps, tamed cats move toward their owner and sleep near them.\n\nWhen the player wakes, their tamed cats also wake.\n\nThere is a 70% chance for a tamed cat to give the player a gift after they wake up, but only if the player sleeps at night (if the player sleeps during a thunderstorm during the daytime, or if the tamed cat has been ordered to sit, the player receives no gift).\n\nThe gift is a dropped item from the cat_morning_gift.json loot table: After a cat gives a gift, both the cat and the gift are located in the general area of the bed the player slept on, including on the other side of walls or floors.\n\nIf a player has multiple standing tamed cats in the area, only the tamed cat that sleeps on the player may provide a gift.\n\nIf all standing tamed cats in the area are prevented from reaching the player (i.e.\n\ntrapped in minecarts or boats), then in Java Edition each cat has a 70% chance of providing a gift while in Bedrock Edition only one cat may give a gift.\n\nTamed cats teleport to the player if they are more than 12 blocks from the player, except where listed below.\n\nIt is possible for a tamed cat to teleport to an inaccessible location (e.g.\n\nunder ice) and be injured or suffocate of various causes as a result.\n\nA cat does not teleport: If the cat has been ordered to sit.\n\nException: The cat is likely to teleport if it is injured while sitting (it does not sit after it teleports).\n\nA dramatic example is if a cat sitting outside is struck by lightning, in which case the cat materializes on fire.\n\nThis kills the cat.\n\nException: If a kitten is told to sit, and grows up while the chunk it is sitting in is still loaded, it teleports to the player and materializes still sitting.\n\nIf the cat is attempting to sit on a chest, bed, or furnace.\n\n [Bedrock Edition only ] If the cat is attempting to lay or is laying on a bed.\n\nIf the cat is in a minecart or boat.\n\nIf the cat has been attached to a fence post with a lead.\n\nIf the cat is in an unloaded chunk.\n\nIf none of the blocks on the edge of a 5\u00d75\u00d71 region centered on the player are transparent blocks with an opaque block below and another transparent block above.\n\nIf the player is in another dimension.\n\nIf the player is in water: The cat teleports to the player when the player leaves the water.\n\nIf the cat is in water: teleportation is unreliable.\n\nIt may or may not occur.\n\nCat teleportation is completely silent.\n\n[4] A sitting tamed black cat.\n\nStray cats can be tamed using raw cod or raw salmon (see #Behavior for how to approach a cat).\n\nOnce tamed, cats follow the player who tamed them.\n\nThey do not despawn, no longer fear the player and purr or meow frequently.\n\nLike wolves, and with the same limits, they can teleport to a player who moves 12 blocks away.\n\nThe player can order a cat to sit/stand by pressing use on it.\n\nIf the player is holding a raw cod or salmon when commanding a cat to sit or stand, the fish is given to the cat instead, causing it to enter love mode.\n\nOnce in love mode, the player can command a cat to sit or stand while holding a fish.\n\nCats also sit on certain things of their own accord (see #Tamed cat).\n\nMain article: Breeding Two cats with a newly bred kitten.\n\nWhen tamed cats are fed a raw cod or salmon, they enter love mode.\n\nBreeding creates a kitten, and the parents cannot breed again for 5 minutes.\n\nThe kitten has the coloring of and belongs to the owner of one of the parents.\n\nTwo sitting cats are unable to breed, but a mobile cat can breed with a sitting cat, in which case the mobile cat's owner also owns the kitten.\n\nThe 20 minute growth of kittens can be reduced using raw cod or salmon.\n\nEach fish reduces the growth time remaining by 10%.\n\nFeeding an injured tamed cat an uncooked cod or salmon restores its health by 2.\n\nUnlike tamed wolves, a tamed cat's tail is not an indicator of its health.\n\nJava Edition: Cats use the Friendly Creatures sound category

2014.\n\n[11] The Jellie cat was based on GoodTimesWithScar's pet cat, Jellie, who passed away on January 4th, 2024.\n\n[12] In MINECON Earth 2018, Jeb announced that the community could vote for a 9th cat skin to be added with the rest of the other 8 cat skins.\n\nAs a result, YouTuber GoodTimesWithScar\u2019s cat Jellie won the contest and was added in Village and Pillage, making the second mob variation that was suggested by the community, the first being \"Toast\", a rabbit skin added as a tribute to a user's deceased pet rabbit.\n\nBoth calico and white cats appear to have heterochromia, which is an uncommon feature in cats making both their eyes different colours.\n\nThe calico cat skin's fur pattern resembles that of Winslow, from Minecraft: Story Mode, with the only differences being the eye color and the mirrored fur pattern.\n\nThe episode in which the cat appears was released two years before calico cats were added to the game.\n\nIn real life, cats have been known for their ability to flip upright during a fall, particularly larger ones; though they still might be injured by landing.\n\nThis fact is reflected in Minecraft because they aren't damaged by falls.\n\nThe current Siamese cat texture is unused in Bedrock Edition.\n\nIn real life, calico cats are almost always female and the few male calicos that do occur are generally sterile.\n\nHowever, since animals in Minecraft are genderless, it isn't odd to breed two calico cats with each other.\n\nPersian cats in-game is the only cat variant that don't have snouts, based on their real-life variant.\n\nThe white cat in-game could be percieved as being a Khao Manee breed, due to their fur is all-white, and all white cats have heterochromia, as with most Khao Manee cats do.\n\nTabby Cat

when tamed, can be ridden and equipped with chests.\n\n1-3 donkeys spawn in plains and only 1 in savannas.\n\nDonkeys also spawn in meadows.\n\n20% of the individual donkeys spawn as foals.\n\n2-6 donkeys spawn only in plains at light level 7 or above.\n\n[1] Adult donkeys are 1.4 blocks wide and long, and 1.6 blocks high.\n\nFoals start at half the size of adults and in Bedrock Edition, get progressively bigger as they age.\n\nUnlike wolves and cats, the appearances of donkeys do not change once they have been tamed, though tamed donkeys may be differentiated by giving them equipment.\n\nDonkeys are smaller all around than the normal horses and sport long, erect ears.\n\nTheir manes do not protrude, but rather are drawn directly on the back of their heads and necks.\n\nAll donkeys have gray-brown coats with darker ankles, ears, manes, and tails.\n\nDonkeys can be equipped with a simple saddle, not the full covered armor and they can also be equipped with chests to store up to 15 stacks of items.\n\nUnlike almost all other mobs, donkeys with equipped saddles or chests do not render these when under the effect of Invisibility.\n\n[2] Upon death, donkeys drop: 0\u20132 Leather.\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-5 with Looting III.\n\n1\u20133, when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nIf equipped with a chest or saddle, they drop those items.\n\nThey also drop the contents of the chest.\n\nUpon successful breeding, 1\u20137 is dropped.\n\nKilling a baby donkey yields no items nor experience.\n\nSee also: Transportation Tamed and saddled donkeys are some of the fastest means of transportation or hauling in the game, although they are unable to fit through single block-wide openings.\n\nThey can also be used to climb hills and jump fences, which the player can't generally.\n\nDonkeys cannot float on water when being controlled by a player.\n\nThey can be ridden in water up to 2 blocks deep.\n\nIn deeper water, the player is automatically dismounted.\n\n[3] Donkeys can be equipped with chests and used as pack animals.\n\nThey can also be pulled along and tied up using a lead.\n\nGUI of a donkey, when equipped with a chest.\n\nTamed donkeys can have the following slot available: Saddle Slot: For equipping a saddle.\n\nAn additional 15 inventory slots, provided the donkey has been equipped with a chest.\n\nEquipment can be placed on a donkey by holding left shift and then using on the donkey, or by accessing its inventory.\n\nA donkey\u2019s inventory can be accessed by mounting the donkey and using inventory control, or by sneaking and then using or pressing the \"open inventory\" button [Bedrock Edition only ] on the donkey.\n\nA donkey can be equipped with a chest by using a chest on a donkey.\n\nThe chest cannot be removed except by killing the donkey, which causes the chest and its contents to drop.\n\nFoals cannot be equipped with anything.\n\nMain article: Riding Once a donkey is tamed and saddled, the player can control it with the standard directional controls, jump, and the mouse.\n\nThe player dismounts using the dismount control.\n\nLike riding other entities, it is impossible for a player to use a nether portal or end portal while on a donkey.\n\nA ridden saddled donkey automatically runs up any one block high slope.\n\nThe donkey and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high.\n\nLower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block.\n\nThe donkey itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks.\n\nThey cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.\n\nUnlike horses, all spawned donkeys have the same movement speed and jump strength, although speed potions can be used on the donkey and travel via the Nether can make the donkey easily the pack animal with the fastest practical way to travel in Minecraft.\n\nDonkeys are slow-moving backward, and about as fast as the player when moving sideways.\n\nRidden saddled donkeys have the ability of \"jumping charging\".\n\nWhen the player rides them, the experience bar on HUD is replaced by jumping charging bar.\n\nA ridden saddled donkey can be made to jump and holding the control charges for a higher leap.\n\nDonkeys are not affected by jump boost beacons or potions.\n\nDonkeys roam around idly, occasionally stopping to rear, swish their tails, or lower their heads as though eating the grass.\n\nUnlike sheep, the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed.\n\nA donkey may turn to look at a player who comes near.\n\nAny donkey, even a wild one, allows itself to be attached to a lead without protest.\n\nHowever, if the player attempts to saddle an untamed donkey, it rears and flails its front hooves.\n\nDonkeys remain passive, even when hit.\n\nDonkeys occasionally emit an audible braying sound.\n\nAdult Donkeys, unlike most mobs, cannot ride in a minecart and boat.\n\nFoals, however, can.\n\nUnlike other passive mobs, donkeys slowly regenerate health.\n\nAdult donkeys can be tamed.\n\nWith an empty hand, mount it repeatedly; when it shows hearts and no longer bucks the player, it is tamed.\n\nIt is necessary to tame a donkey in order to breed it, give it equipment, or ride it for any length of time.\n\nTaming depends on the donkey's \"temper\".\n\nThey begin with a temper of 0 out of 100.\n\nWhen a player is riding the donkey, a random number between 0 and 99 is chosen.\n\nThe donkey becomes tame if this number is less than the temper, otherwise, the temper is increased by 5 and the player is bucked off.\n\nTemper can also be increased by feeding the donkey.\n\nWhile riding an untamed donkey, a galloping sound is audible, more or less rapid.\n\nThis gives a general idea of the donkey's speed.\n\nIt is unknown whether there is any indication of jump height before taming.\n\nLike all tamed animals, a death message is displayed to their owner if they are killed.

and 1 of 5 marking patterns: no markings, stockings and blaze, paint, snowflake appaloosa and sooty.\n\nIn total, there are 35 possible horse coat combinations.\n\nUnlike almost all other mobs, horses with equipped saddles don't render these when under the effect of Invisibility.\n\n[1] Horse colors and markings Upon death, horses drop: 0\u20132 Leather.\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-5 with Looting III.\n\n1\u20133 exp.\n\nwhen killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nHorse armor if the horse was already equipped Saddle if the horse was already equipped.\n\nUpon successful breeding, 1\u20137 is dropped.\n\nKilling a foal yields neither items nor experience.\n\nSee also: Transportation Tamed and saddled horses can be used as a means of transportation in the game.\n\nWhen ridden, they are able to move faster and jump higher than a normal player.\n\nHorses can be used to climb hills and jump fences, as some can jump high enough to clear up to five block heights, versus the player's maximum of about one (without jump boost).\n\nHorses cannot float on water when being controlled by a player.\n\nThey can be ridden in water up to 2 blocks deep.\n\nIn deeper water, the player is automatically dismounted.\n\n[2] Horses can be pulled along and tied up using a lead.\n\nThey can be towed in two ways: Horses can swim behind a boat by using a lead, or a boat can be attached to a lead [Bedrock Edition only ] (before putting the horse in the boat) and the player can swim to tow the boat containing the horse.\n\nHorse UI Tamed horses have the following two slots available: Horse Armor Slot: For equipping horse armor.\n\nExclusive to horses.\n\nSaddle Slot: For equipping a saddle.\n\nFoals cannot be equipped.\n\nEquipment can be placed on a horse by holding it and then using on the horse, or by accessing its inventory.\n\nA horse\u2019s inventory can be accessed by mounting the horse and using inventory control, or by sneaking and then using or pressing the \"open inventory\" button  [Bedrock Edition only ] on the horse.\n\nA normal horse\u2019s inventory has two slots, one for a saddle and one for horse armor.\n\nMain article: Riding Once a horse is tamed and saddled, the player can control it with standard directional controls, jump, and the mouse.\n\nThe player dismounts using the dismount control.\n\nLike riding other entities, it is impossible for a player to use a nether portal or end portal while on a horse.\n\nA ridden saddled horse automatically runs up any one block high slope.\n\nThe horse and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high.\n\nLower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block.\n\nThe horse itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks.\n\nHorses cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.\n\nThe maximum speed of horses varies between 4.74 blocks/second and 14.23 blocks/second (compared to the player's walking speed, which is about 4.317 blocks/second).\n\nAbout 82% of horses are able to go faster than a minecart.\n\nHorses move backward slowly, about as fast as the player when moving sideways.\n\nA horse\u2019s speed can also be affected by potions.\n\nSpeed has no relation to a horse\u2019s outward appearance.\n\nRidden saddled horses have the ability of \"jumping charging\".\n\nWhen the player rides them, the experience bar on HUD is replaced by jumping charging bar.\n\nA ridden saddled horse can be made to jump and holding the control charges for a higher leap.\n\nHorses are not affected by jump boost beacons or potions.\n\nA horse eating grass.\n\nA horse rearing.\n\nHorses wander aimlessly, occasionally stopping to rear, flick their tails, or lower their heads as though eating the grass.\n\nUnlike sheep, the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed.\n\nIf a player comes near, the horses may turn to look at them.\n\nAny horse, even a wild or undead horse, can be attached to a lead without protest, although an untamed horse rears and flails its forelegs if saddled.\n\nHorses remain passive, even when hit.\n\nHorses make neighing and whinnying sounds.\n\nHorses, like most mobs, can ride in a minecart or a boat.\n\nAdult horses cannot ride in boats. [Java Edition only ] Unlike other passive mobs, horses slowly regenerate health.\n\nTamed (and untamed [Java Edition only ]) horses can be led by a player holding a golden carrot, golden apple, or enchanted golden apple.\n\nBaby horses follow adult horses.\n\nTaming a horse is required to breed it, to give it equipment, or to control it while riding.\n\nA player mounts a horse by pressing use on it with an empty hand, or while holding an object that cannot be used on a horse.\n\nA player tames an adult horse by repeatedly mounting it until the horse stops bucking off the player.\n\nTaming depends on the horse's \"temper\".\n\nHorses begin with a temper of 0 out of 100.\n\nWhen a player first mounts the horse, a random taming threshold 0\u201399 is chosen.\n\nThe horse becomes tame if the temper exceeds this threshold.\n\nOtherwise, the player is bucked off and the temper is increased by 5, to be compared against the threshold the next time the player mounts the horse.\n\nTemper can also be increased by feeding the horse.\n\nAfter repeated mountings, hearts appear above the horse, indicating that it is tamed.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, like all tame animals, when a horse is killed, a death message is displayed to every player.\n\nFeeding two tamed horses golden apples or golden carrots activates love mode, causing them to mate and produce a foal.\n\nThe foal appears more spindly than adult horses and grows in stages to full size with time.\n\nThe foal can be fed to make it mature faster.\n\nDepending on the variations of the parent horses, the offspring can be one of several types.\n\nBred with a horse: Breeding two horses produces a horse foal.\n\nUsually, the new foal has the color and markings of one of its parents, although there is a 13 \u2044 45 chance of having a random color/markings (which may still end up being the same as one of the parents).\n\nBred with donkey: Cross-breeding a horse with a donkey creates a mule foal.\n\nMules cannot breed.\n\nThis unlocks the Artificial Selection achievement. [Bedrock Edition only ] This is a table representing the probabilities of the color and markings of the foal when breeding two horses A and B.\n\nFeeding a horse food can alter its behavior, cause it to grow (if it is not yet an adult; foals normally take 20 minutes to fully mature if not fed), and/or restore its health.\n\nThe table below lists the effects of the various foods horses can take.\n\nZombie and skeleton horses cannot be fed, even if tamed.\n\nTo feed a horse, hold a valid food item and press use on the horse.\n\nFeeding invalid food causes the player to mount the horse.\n\nHorses can be fed only when feeding would have an effect, similar to other animals.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Horses All horses have three \"equine stats\" that vary from horse to horse: health, (maximum) movement speed, and jump height.\n\nThese stats are created once the horse is born or spawned, and are not affected by food.\n\nWhen spawned in any way except breeding \u2013 for instance, using commands, spawning naturally, spawning as part of a skeleton trap, or using spawn eggs \u2013 horses are assigned their stats within certain ranges.\n\nHorse's hearts ranges from 15\u201330, with an average of 22.5 \u00d7 11.25.\n\nDisplayed hearts are health, divided by two, rounded down.\n\nA horse with an odd number of health points (15, 17, 19, etc.) does not show the last half-heart.\n\nOne may test this by hitting a horse: if the horse has lost one-half heart from one punch, it has an even number of health points.\n\nOtherwise, odd.\n\nHorse's movement speed ranges from 0.1125\u20130.3375 in internal units, with an average of 0.225.\n\nFor reference, the player's normal walking speed is 0.1.\n\nThe speed listed does not include any status effect that affects the speed of the horse or the player.\n\nThe conversion factor between internal units and blocks/sec is roughly 43.17.\n\nHowever, horses instead travel at just shy of 42.16 blocks/sec times their internal attribute, putting the best horse's maximum speed at 14.23 blocks/second, and the average horse's speed at about 9.49 blocks/sec.\n\nMinimum: 4.85 blocks/sec.\n\nPlayer speed (walking): 4.317 blocks/sec.\n\nPlayer speed (sprinting): 5.612 blocks/sec.\n\nSee also transportation methods to compare the speeds of various transportation methods.\n\nHorse's jump strength ranges from 0.4\u20131.0, with an average of 0.7.\n\nA jump strength of 0.5 is enough to clear 1 9 \u2044 16 blocks, while 1.0 is enough to clear 5 1 \u2044 4 blocks.\n\nWhen breeding two horses, or a horse and a donkey, the foal's stats are determined by averaging both parent's stats and adding a random variation to it.\n\nThe variant of the child has an 11% chance to be a random base color, and a 20% chance to have random markings.\n\nOtherwise, it chooses the values from one of its parents.\n\nJava Edition: Horses use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191

Height: 1.6 Blocks Width: 1.4 Blocks Baby: Height: 0.8 Blocks Width: 0.7 Blocks Mules are infertile offspring of horses and donkeys that, when tamed, can be ridden and equipped with chests.\n\nMules do not spawn naturally, but they can spawn through cross-breeding a horse with a donkey.\n\nMules cannot breed with other mules.\n\n20% of mule spawn eggs produce foals.\n\nMules are the offspring of horses and donkeys and are closer to (but not quite) the size of a normal horse.\n\nTheir ears, coats, and manes are like those of a donkey, though mules' coats are darker and reddish-brown.\n\nLike donkeys, mules cannot be equipped with armor but can be equipped with chests.\n\nMules cannot have foals, much like mules in real life.\n\nUnlike almost all other mobs, mules with equipped saddles or chests do not render them when under the effect of Invisibility.\n\n[1] Upon death, mules drop: 0\u20132 Leather.\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-5 with Looting III.\n\n1\u20133, when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nIf equipped with a chest or saddle, they drop those items, as well as any contents of the chest.\n\nSee also: Transportation Tamed and saddled mules can be used as a means of transportation in the game.\n\nMules cannot float on water when being controlled by a player.\n\nThey can be ridden in water up to 2 blocks deep.\n\nIn deeper water, the player is automatically dismounted.\n\n[2] Mules can be equipped with chests and used as pack animals.\n\nThey can be pulled along and tied up using a lead.\n\nGUI of a mule.\n\nTamed mules have the following slot available: Saddle Slot: For equipping a saddle.\n\nAn additional 15 inventory slots, provided the mule has been equipped with a chest.\n\nEquipment can be placed on a mule by holding it and then using on the mule, or by accessing its inventory.\n\nA mule\u2019s inventory can be accessed by mounting the mule and using inventory control, or by sneaking and then using or pressing the \"open inventory\" button  [Bedrock Edition only ] on the mule.\n\nA mule starts out with just a saddle slot, but if it is given a chest, it acquires 15 more inventory slots that can hold anything the player wishes.\n\nChests can be given to a mule by using it with the chest in hand, and the chest cannot be removed except by killing the mule.\n\nUpon death, the mule drops the attached chest and its contents.\n\nFoals cannot be equipped with anything.\n\nMain article: Riding Once a mule is tamed and saddled, the player can control it with standard directional controls, jump, and the mouse.\n\nThe player dismounts using the dismount control.\n\nFor a long time, it was impossible for a player to use a nether portal or end portal while on a mule, until snapshot 24w21b, when minecraft added the new \"entitiesWithPassengersCanUsePortals\" gamerule, allowing minecarts, boats, and animals like pigs or horses to be ridden through a portal A ridden saddled mule automatically runs up any one block high slope.\n\nThe mule and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high.\n\nLower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block.\n\nThe mule itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks.\n\nMules cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.\n\nThe maximum speed of mules, when created by breeding a horse and a donkey, varies between 4.8375 blocks/second and 14.5125 blocks/second (compared to the player's walking speed, which is about 4.3 blocks/second).\n\nAbout 68% of mules are able to go faster than a minecart.\n\nAny mule spawned with its spawn egg always has a speed of 7.525 blocks/second, which is slower than a minecart at full speed.\n\nMules are slow-moving backward, and about as fast as the player when moving sideways.\n\nRidden saddled mules have the ability of \"jumping charging\".\n\nWhen the player rides them, the experience bar on HUD is replaced by jumping charging bar.\n\nA ridden saddled mule can be made to jump and holding the control charges for a higher leap.\n\nMules are not affected by jump boost beacons or potions.\n\nAll mules roam idly, occasionally stopping to rear, swish their tails, or lower their heads as though eating the grass.\n\nUnlike sheep, the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed.\n\nMules turn to look at any player that comes near.\n\nAny mule, even a wild one, allows itself to be attached to a lead without protest.\n\nHowever, if the player attempts to saddle an untamed mule, it rears and flails its front hooves.\n\nMules, like most mobs, can ride in a minecart and boat.\n\nUnlike other passive mobs, mules slowly regenerate health.\n\nAdult mules can be tamed: with an empty hand, mount the mule repeatedly; when it no longer bucks the player and shows hearts, it is tamed.\n\nIt is necessary to tame a mule in order to give it equipment or ride it for any length of time.\n\nTaming depends on the mule's \"temper\".\n\nMules begin with a temper of 0 out of 100.\n\nWhen a player is riding the mule, a random number between 0 and 99 is chosen.\n\nThe mule becomes tame if this number is less than the temper, otherwise, the temper is increased by 5 and the player is bucked off.\n\nTemper can also be increased by feeding the mule.\n\nWhile riding an untamed mule, a galloping sound is audible, more or less rapid to give a general idea of the mule's speed.\n\nIt is unknown whether there is any indication of jump height before taming.\n\nLike all tamed animals, a death message is displayed to their owner if they are killed. [Bedrock Edition only ] Like their real-life counterparts, mules in Minecraft cannot produce offspring.\n\nThe only way to produce a mule (other than using a spawn egg) is to cross-breed a horse with a donkey.\n\nFeeding a mule food can alter its behavior, cause it to grow (if it is not yet an adult; foals normally take 20 minutes to fully mature if not fed), and/or restore its health.\n\nThe table below lists the effects of the various foods mules eat.\n\nTo feed a mule, hold a valid food item and press use on the mule.\n\nIf the food is invalid, the player simply mounts the mule.\n\nMules can be fed only when feeding would have an effect, similar to other animals.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Horses Mules have three \"equine stats\" that vary from mule to mule: health, (maximum) movement speed, and jump strength.\n\nThese stats are created once the mule is born or spawned, and are not affected by food.\n\nWhen spawned in any way except breeding \u2013 for instance, using commands or using spawn eggs \u2013 mules are assigned their stats within certain ranges, specific according to their horse type.\n\nA mule's health ranges from 15\u201330, but tends toward the average of 22\u201323.\n\nDisplayed hearts are health, divided by two, rounded down.\n\nA mule with a non-even number of health points (15, 17, 19, etc.) does not show the last half-heart.\n\nIf the mule has lost one fewer health point than the inflicted damage and did not regenerate, it has an odd number of health points, otherwise, it has an even number of health points.\n\nSpawned mules' speed is always 0.175; the player's normal walking speed is 0.1.\n\nThe speed listed does not include any status effect that affects the speed of a horse or a player.\n\nBred mules have speed based on their parent's speeds, like all other horse breeding.\n\nSee transportation to compare the speeds of various transportation methods.\n\nSpawned mules' jump strength is usually 0.5, which is enough to clear 1 9 \u2044 16 blocks.\n\nOther jump strengths can be found in bred mules, depending on the statistics of the parents (as explained later).\n\nWhen breeding a horse and a donkey, the foal's stats are determined by a variation of the average of both parents' stats, randomly determined as horses' stats are.\n\nJava Edition: Mules use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b c MC-98316 \u2014 Wrong subtitles caused by missing distinction Bedrock Edition: \u2191 Except for stems, Nether wood, cherry wood, and bamboo wood due to MCPE-165012 Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Mules have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Additional fields for mobs that can breed Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Tags common to all horses ChestedHorse: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the horse has chests.\n\nA chested horse that is not a donkey or a mule crashes the game.\n\nItems: List of items.\n\nOnly exists if ChestedHorse is true.\n\nAn item, including the Slot tag.\n\nSlots are numbered 2 to 16 for donkeys and mules, and none exist for all other horses.\n\nTags common to all items Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Mule\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nA \"mule\" specifically refers to the offspring of a male donkey (jack) and a female horse (mare).\n\nThe offspring of a female donkey (jenny) and a male horse (stallion) is called a \"hinny\".\n\nBecause mules are way more common than hinnies however, \"mule\" can colloquially refer to any donkey-horse hybrid.\n\nA herd of various horses and a baby mule.\n\nA donkey and a mule.\n\nHorse Donkey Skeleton Horse Zombie Horse Llama \u2191 MC-13738 \u2191 MC-72440 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 \"Also big thanks to @DrZhark, the creator of Mo' Creatures, that have assisted us to make it happen!\" \u2013 @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X, April 4, 2013 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

[Java Edition only ] Killing a baby skeleton horse yields no items or experience.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, killing a trap skeleton horse also yields no items or experience.\n\nSee also: Transportation Skeleton horses can be used as one of the fastest means of transportation in the game, though they are unable to fit through single block-wide openings.\n\nWhen ridden, they can also be used to climb hills and jump fences because the skeleton horses can jump up to five block heights, versus the player's maximum of one (without jump boost).\n\nThey can be ridden in water in any depth, and do so faster than non-skeleton horses.\n\nSkeleton horses sink in the water and can be ridden along the ocean or river floor.\n\nSkeleton horses can be pulled using a lead.\n\nGUI of a skeleton horse. [JE only ] Java Edition Skeleton horses have the following slot available: Saddle Slot: For equipping a saddle.\n\nSaddles can be placed on a tamed skeleton horse by holding it and then using on the skeleton horse, or by accessing its inventory.\n\nA skeleton horse's inventory can be accessed by mounting the skeleton horse and using inventory control, or by sneaking and then using on the skeleton horse.\n\nBaby skeleton horses cannot be equipped.\n\nBedrock Edition A skeleton horse does not have an inventory and cannot be equipped with a saddle or armor.\n\nDespite this, the default texture file, like those of normal horses, donkeys and mules, includes a chest.\n\nMain article: Riding In Bedrock Edition, skeleton horses can be controlled by the player without a saddle.\n\nHowever, in Java Edition, skeleton horses can be equipped with a saddle and then controlled.\n\nLike riding other entities, it is impossible for a player to use a nether portal or end portal while on a skeleton horse.\n\nThe player can control a tamed (and saddled Java Edition) skeleton horse with standard directional controls, jump, and the mouse.\n\nThe player dismounts using the dismount control.\n\nA player controlled skeleton horse automatically runs up any one block high slope.\n\nThe skeleton horse and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high.\n\nLower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block.\n\nThe horse itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks.\n\nSkeleton horses cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.\n\nPlayer controlled skeleton horses have the ability of \"jumping charging\".\n\nWhen the player rides them, the experience bar on HUD is replaced by jumping charging bar.\n\nA controlled skeleton horses can be made to jump and holding the control charges for a higher leap.\n\nSkeleton horses are not affected by jump boost beacons or potions.\n\nUnlike normal horses, a skeleton horse does not force the player to dismount when it is under water; rather, it can be ridden underwater without drowning.\n\nThe player can still drown underwater without the proper potions or enchantments, even when mounted on the skeleton horse.\n\nWhen underwater, its running speed and jump remain the same although it has a slower rate of descent.\n\nThe skeleton horse is an undead mob that is initially neutral, but become passive after their rider is killed.\n\nSkeleton horses behave like normal horses, roaming idly and occasionally stopping to rear or lower their heads as though eating the grass.\n\nUnlike sheep, the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed.\n\nSkeleton horses can breathe in water.\n\nUnlike other animal mobs, skeleton horses slowly regenerate health evident by their health bar while the player rides it.\n\nThis is the same case for normal horses.\n\nSkeleton horses cannot be bred or fed.\n\nSkeleton horses, in common with other undead mobs, take damage when affected by a Potion of Healing and are healed by a Potion of Harming.\n\nThey are also affected by the Smite enchantment.\n\nOther notes: In Java Edition, skeleton horses spawned by skeleton horse traps spawn tamed.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, skeleton horses are always tamed regardless of spawning conditions.\n\nThe skeleton horses are passive if the player kills the skeleton rider.\n\nThe skeleton wears an iron helmet, unless it randomly spawned with some other headgear.\n\nThe skeleton's bow and helmet are enchanted as if on an enchantment table at level 5\u201322.\n\nThe exact level depends on regional difficulty; on Easy it is always a level-5 enchantment.\n\nThe skeleton trap horse and the skeleton horse in a jockey are always adult.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the skeleton trap horse is not an adult nor a baby, though it looks like an adult.\n\nBaby skeleton horses can be spawned with a spawn egg.\n\nBaby skeleton horses cannot grow up normally In Bedrock Edition.\n\nThe skeleton in a naturally spawned skeleton horseman jockey does not despawn.\n\nA trap horse may spawn in areas that a regular horse may not, such as the middle of an ocean.\n\nA trap horse can trigger normally in clear weather (and often a player encounters a trap horse after the thunderstorm has cleared).\n\nThe skeleton drops more experience orbs.\n\nIf the difficulty is set to Peaceful, the skeleton riders disappear but the horses remain.\n\nThe skeleton does not shoot any mob that attacks the skeleton horse.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, skeleton horses will be killed by the Conduit like any regular hostile mob, despite being tamed.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Horses All horses have three \"equine stats\" that vary from horse to horse: health, maximum movement speed, and jump strength.\n\nThese stats are created once the horse is born or spawned, and are not affected by food.\n\nWhen spawned in any way except breeding \u2013 for instance, using commands, spawning naturally, spawning as part of a skeleton trap, or using spawn eggs \u2013 horses are assigned their stats within certain ranges, specific according to their horse type.\n\nA skeleton horse's health is always 15.\n\nDisplayed hearts are health, divided by two, rounded down.\n\nA horse with an odd number of health points (15, 17, 19, etc.) does not show the last half-heart.\n\nIf the horse has lost one health point lower than the inflicted damage and did not regenerate, it has an odd number of health points, otherwise, it has an even number of health points.\n\nSkeleton horse's speed is always 0.2; the player's normal walking speed is 0.1.\n\nThe speed listed does not include any status effect that affects the speed of a horse or a player.\n\nSee transportation to compare the speeds of various transportation methods.\n\nJump strength ranges from 0.4 to 1.0, averaging 0.7.\n\nA jump strength of 0.5 is enough to clear 1 19 \u2044 32 blocks, while 1.0 is enough to clear 5 9 \u2044 32 blocks.\n\nThe jump strengths required to clear several block heights are: Skeleton horse sounds are the sounds of the regular horse but lower pitched and slowed with reverb.\n\nJava Edition: Skeleton horses use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b MC-177091 \u2191 The precise equation is as follows: velocity = sqrt  (speed.x 2 \u00d7 0.2 + speed.y 2 + speed.z 2 \u00d7 0.2) {\\displaystyle \\text{velocity}=\\operatorname{sqrt}(\\text{speed.x}^2\\times0.2+\\text{speed.y}^2+\\text{speed.z}^2\\times0.2)} volume = {\\displaystyle \\text{volume}=} (whichever is smaller) 0.1 or (velocity \u00d7 10 {\\displaystyle \\text{velocity}\\times10} if being ridden and velocity \u00d7 8.75 {\\displaystyle \\text{velocity}\\times8.75} if not) \u2191 a b MC-177090 Bedrock Edition: \u2191 This sound event would occur if skeleton horses could have armor equipped.\n\n\u2191 This sound event would occur if skeleton horses could have a chest equipped.\n\n\u2191 Except for stems, Nether wood, cherry wood, and bamboo wood due to MCPE-165012 Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Skeleton horses have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Additional fields for mobs that can breed Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Tags common to all horses SkeletonTrap: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the horse is a trapped skeleton horse.\n\nDoes not affect horse type.\n\nSkeletonTrapTime: Incremented each tick when SkeletonTrap is set to 1.\n\nThe horse automatically despawns when it reaches 18000 (15 minutes).\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Skeleton horse\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nDr.\n\nZhark appears in the credits after the End Poem as the creator of the horses, including skeleton horses.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, skeleton horses can be transported in a boat by riding the skeleton horse and jumping into the boat then dismounting (leaving the horse behind in the boat) and activating the boat from underneath/underwater.\n\nAttempting to activate the boat in order to pilot it from above results in the player being mounted on the horse again rather than being placed inside the boat to pilot it.\n\nA skeleton horse spawned in.\n\nThe four variations of skeleton traps using \"Grumm\" or \"Dinnerbone\" name tags.\n\nSkeleton horses spawned from a trapped skeleton horse.\n\nA player riding a skeleton horse, having killed the skeleton rider.\n\nA player riding a skeleton horse underwater.\n\nIt can run and jump.\n\nSkeleton horse with saddle [Java Edition only ] in survival after defeating the skeleton horse trap.\n\nA skeleton horse in Minecraft Education.\n\nLego Minecraft Skeleton Horse.\n\nHorse Donkey Mule Skeleton \u2191 \"Also big thanks to @DrZhark, the creator of Mo' Creatures, that have assisted us to make it happen!\" \u2013 @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X, April 4, 2013 \u2191 MC-129262 \u2191 MC-121832 \u2191 MC-166246 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\nEntities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

can be tamed and used to assist in combat with most hostile mobs.\n\nWolves spawn naturally above grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, snow blocks, or podzol.\n\nThere are 9 variants of wolf with each has different texture.\n\nThe variant is determined by the biome they spawn in with a default pack size of 4.\n\nThe variants are: Pale wolf: The wolf variant that most players are familiar with.\n\nThis variant spawns in the taiga biome.\n\nWoods wolf: This variant spawns in the forest biome.\n\nThis is the most likely wolf variant that the player can find in the Overworld since forest biome is very common.\n\nAshen wolf: This variant spawns in the snowy taiga biome.\n\nBlack wolf: This variant spawns in the old growth pine taiga biome, in smaller packs of 2-4.\n\nChestnut wolf: This variant spawns in the old growth spruce taiga biome, in smaller packs of 2-4.\n\nRusty wolf: This variant spawns in the sparse jungle biome, in smaller packs of 2-4.\n\nSpotted wolf: This variant spawns in the savanna plateau biome, in larger packs of 4-8.\n\nStriped wolf: This variant spawns in the wooded badlands biome, in larger packs of 4-8.\n\nSnowy wolf: This variant spawns in the grove biome.\n\nThis wolf is a rare type as it doesn't spawn in a pack with other wolves.\n\nNaturally-spawned wolves are untamed and become hostile if attacked by the player.\n\nWhen summoned in other ways (e.g.\n\nusing the spawn egg or using the / summon command), the variant selection follows the natural spawning biome rules with the extensions of the fact that rusty wolf, spotted wolf, and striped wolf are selected in all jungle biomes, savanna biomes, and badlands biomes respectively.\n\nAdult wolves drop 1\u20133 experience orbs when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nA tamed wolf that is killed by its owner still drops experience.\n\nUpon successful breeding, 1\u20137 are dropped.\n\nLike other baby animals, killing a pup yields no experience.\n\nA tamed wolf \"begging\" the player for food.\n\nThree tamed wolves following the player around.\n\nWolves exhibit three different states depending on how the user interacts with them: Untamed wolves have gray fur, a drooping tail, and their eyes consist of a white pixel and a black pixel for the pupil (on each side).\n\nThey are neutral toward the player and hostile toward sheep, rabbits, foxes, baby turtles, and skeletons.\n\nThey avoid llamas, although wolves may attack a llama that spits on them.\n\nThey do not despawn, even if they are in an unloaded chunk, or 32 blocks away from the player.\n\nAngry wolves are characterized by their constant growling and fearsome appearance.\n\nWild wolves become hostile when they are either attacked by a player or mob, if not killed in one hit [1]  [JE only ], or when they see a mob they want to eat.\n\nTheir tail is held out straight, their eyes become red, their mouth is raised in a slight snarl, and they have angry eyebrows.\n\nAngry wolves are hostile only to mobs that attack them, or to the mobs they are hunting.\n\nThey can see attackers even if they are under the invisibility effect, but they cannot track the attacker down, if they get out of their render distance, or the attacker was able to unload the chunk where the wolves were.\n\nAngry wolves cannot be leashed, but a wild wolf may become angry while it is still leashed without dropping the lead.\n\nTamed wolves have friendlier-looking eyes.\n\nThey have a default red collar around their neck, which can be dyed using any color of dye on the wolf.\n\nThis also includes other wolves owned by other player, where any player can dye that wolf's collar.\n\nPressing use on the wolf makes it sit and remain in place and not follow the player around.\n\nTamed wolves that are not sitting attack players or mobs that their owner attacks, or those that injure their owner unless the target has the same owner or is on the same team.\n\nThey do not attack creepers, ghasts, tamed horses or tamed cats, regardless of owner.\n\nStanding tamed wolves attack only skeletons and their variants without provocation.\n\nTamed wolves are always passive to the player, even if the player hits them or kills a tamed wolf on the same team.\n\nA wolf becomes hostile to a player or other mob that attacks it unless the attacker is the wolf's owner, or is otherwise on the same team, or if killed in one hit [JE only ].\n\nIt also causes wild wolves and standing tamed wolves in a 33\u00d733\u00d721 cuboid centered on the attacked wolf to become hostile to the attacker, allowing coordination for attacks and team hunts (only in wild wolves).\n\nIn Java Edition, any tamed wolf attacked by a player/mob causes all standing wolves on that team to attack that player/mob who attacked the tamed wolf.\n\nIf damaged by a mob or entity other than a player or arrow, wolves of any type only take roughly half of the original damage ((damage + 1) / 2).\n\nSkeletons and their variants, foxes, baby turtles and passive rabbits actively avoid both tamed and wild wolves.\n\nKiller rabbits  [JE only ] attack wolves actively.\n\nSheep ignore wolves, but flee when attacked by one.\n\nSheep ignore tamed wolves but also do not flee from them.\n\nWhen a player within 8 blocks holds meat or bones near a wolf, the wolf tilts its head as if to 'beg' for the food for 2 to 4 seconds.\n\nThe behavior of pups is the same as tamed wolves.\n\nPups have larger heads, similar to other animal babies.\n\nWolves are 0.85 [JE only ] or 0.8 [BE only ] blocks tall and pups are 0.425 [JE only ] or 0.4 [BE only ] blocks tall.\n\nThe textures of the wolves are tinted dark gray once submerged in water.\n\nIn Peaceful difficulty, hostile wolves deal no damage to the player.\n\nA tamed wolf shaking off water.\n\nStanding tamed wolves wander randomly when near their owner, but follow if more than 10 blocks away and teleport to a nearby free block (if any) if more than 12 blocks away.\n\nBesides making travel easier, teleportation can be used to rescue them from lava, water or pits, as they immediately teleport to a safe area.\n\nWolves can be told to \"sit\" by pressing use on them and made to stand again with another press of use.\n\nA wolf automatically sits when first tamed.\n\nWhile sitting, they do not follow the player.\n\nHowever, if their owner fights a mob near them, they are still likely to join the fight.\n\nWhen the fight is over, they go back to sitting (if in water, they do not sit until they are on dry land, telling the wolf to sit makes it stand).\n\nThey sit at their new location instead of returning to wherever they were previously.\n\nWolves stand up and follow the player if it is pushed into water or injured while sitting.\n\nWolves can either attack (within 16 blocks) or flee (within 24 blocks) from llamas.\n\nThe wolves' speed is increased by 50% whereas they flee.\n\nWolves find paths to their targets if attacking within 16 blocks, even in difficult terrain.\n\nThey also navigate along the edges of cliffs and occasionally fall far enough to take damage if they leap.\n\nWolves attack their targets running about at the player's walking speed and by leaping at them in exactly the same manner as spiders, but cause no damage while in midair.\n\nTamed wolves attack any animal the player starts to attack.\n\nThey also can navigate and turn around in 1\u00d71 horizontal tunnels.\n\nAfter emerging from water, a wolf shakes the water off their fur.\n\nThis is represented by an animation and water particles.\n\nTamed wolves teleport to their owner, if they are more than 12 blocks away, with a few caveats.\n\nTeleporting resets the focus of a tamed wolf, so if a wolf is attacking a mob and teleports beside a player, it resumes following the player, as its tracking has been reset.\n\nIt is possible for tamed wolves to teleport to an inaccessible location (e.g.\n\nunder ice) and be injured or die of suffocation as a result.\n\nThis happens when the wolf considers transparent blocks, such as glass, or slabs, to be open.\n\nIt cannot teleport when it is sitting.\n\nAn angry or untamed wolf does not teleport.\n\nTamed wolves do not teleport if: The wolf has been ordered to sit.\n\n[2] Exception: The wolf is likely to teleport if it is injured while sitting (it no longer sits after teleporting).\n\nAn example is if a wolf that is sitting is hit by another player, it teleports to their owner.\n\nException: If the wolf is in a loaded chunk, and the player gets damaged by a mob, there's a chance for the wolf to stop sitting, causing them to teleport if the player is far away, then attacking the player's attacker and sitting down afterward.\n\nThe wolf is chasing after a skeleton.\n\nThis can lead to wolves standing and jumping in one place, such as over a cavern if a skeleton is near.\n\nThe wolf teleports once the skeleton is killed.\n\nThe wolf is in a minecart or a boat.\n\nThe wolf has been attached to a fence post with a lead.\n\nThe wolf is in an unloaded chunk.\n\nNone of the blocks on the edge of a 5\u00d71\u00d75 region centered on the player are transparent blocks with a solid block below and another transparent block above.\n\nThe player is in another dimension; a wolf remains in its current dimension until the player returns.\n\nHowever, wolves can be transported to another dimension by pushing them into the portal first.\n\nThe owner is not directly touching the ground (e.g.\n\nusing elytra, swimming, flying, in a boat).\n\nThe wolf is in any body of water, it may not teleport to the owner.

spawns has a 5% chance to check for an existing chicken within a 10\u00d76\u00d710 box centered on the baby's spawn location and spawn riding one of those chickens if there are any.\n\nIf it fails that 5% chance, there is an additional 5% chance of the baby zombie spawning mounted on a new chicken.\n\nIn a chicken-free environment, each spawned zombie has a 0.25% chance of becoming a chicken jockey; if chickens are present, the chance increases to 0.4875%.\n\nChicken jockeys may spawn with items equipped.\n\nBaby zombified piglin versions of the chicken jockey always have a golden sword equipped, while baby drowned versions may have a trident.\n\nAlthough chickens take damage from magma blocks, baby zombified piglin jockeys still spawn on them, killing the chicken and leaving just the baby zombified piglin.\n\nProvoking the zombified piglin chicken jockey causes it to attack, like a normal zombified piglin.\n\nMain articles: Chicken \u00a7 Drops, Zombie \u00a7 Drops, Drowned

[BE only ] They are immune to guardians or elder guardians attacks.\n\nThey also have a small chance to be immune to knockback when damaged.\n\n[3] Some drowned spawn with the ability to pick up loot that is on the ground.\n\nThat includes armor and weapons or tools just like regular zombies.\n\nUnlike zombies however, they can also pick up tridents, which they always prefer over anything else.\n\nThey also can pick it up and throw it the wrong way.\n\nDrowned can be damaged by a fully-powered conduit within 8 blocks.\n\nIf one drowned gets attacked by another drowned's trident, the attacked drowned ignores it.\n\nA drowned swimming in Bedrock Edition.\n\nA drowned in a river.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition.\n\nDrowned use a swimming animation similar to the player.\n\nThey use this animation whenever they try to pathfind to a player that is either below or above them; if the player is on the same ground level, the drowned simply walk toward them.\n\nDrowned also use this animation if they are tracking a player while they are not standing on a solid block.\n\nTheir hitbox does not change when using this animation.\n\nAlso, if they hold a nautilus shell or anything else in their offhand, their arms are in the same posture as a player's.\n\nWhen attacking, they use the player's attacking animation.\n\nStill, they use the same swimming animation when tracking a player underwater.\n\nIn Java Edition a Trident enchanted with Impaling does not do extra damage to Drowned because they're classified as undead and not aquatic.\n\nThis does not apply in Bedrock Edition as instead a Trident enchanted with Impaling does extra damage to any mob in water or rain.\n\nJava Edition: Drowned use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b MC-177110 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 a b This variable is block-dependent, and varies depending upon the block \u2191 Depends on the drowned's velocity, around 0.003 when moving around underwater with no target.\n\nThe precise equation is the smaller of 1.0 or 0.35\u00d7(the momentum of the drowned, with the horizontal axes multiplied by 0.2) Bedrock Edition: \u2191 a b c MCPE-53297 Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Drowned have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Tags common to all zombies Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nThis page would benefit from the addition of more images.\n\nPlease remove this notice once you've added suitable images to the article.\n\nThe specific instructions are: Render of drowned in Bedrock Edition.\n\nIssues relating to \"Drowned\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nDrowned are not considered as aquatic mobs; instead, they are considered as undead, unaffected by Impaling enchantment.\n\n[7]  [Java Edition only ] A drowned chicken jockey floats to the surface because the chicken it is riding floats, causing the drowned riding it to burn in sunlight during the day, resulting in a chicken in the middle of the ocean or river where the drowned jockey spawned in. [Java Edition only ] In Bedrock Edition, drowned have a 3D outer layer.\n\nThis causes their heads and arms to look larger than in Java Edition and causes rendering conflicts with armor, particularly helmets.\n\nLike spiders and endermen, drowned have eyes that appear to glow, although they do not produce light.\n\nAn unreleased drowned texture.\n\nThree drowned mobs that spawned naturally in an ocean biome.\n\nA group of drowned attacking the player.\n\nDrowned within a coral reef.\n\nA drowned attacking a pufferfish after being attacked by it.\n\nDrowned can sometimes spawn in ocean ruins in positions that they can't get out of.\n\nA drowned wearing armor.\n\nThis occurs only on drowned zombies, not naturally spawned drowned.

during thunderstorms, when player has not entered a bed for at least 3 ingame days.\n\nDamage Java Edition: Easy & Normal: 2 Hard: 3 Bedrock Edition: Easy: 4 Normal: 6 Hard: 9 Details Size Height: 0.5 Blocks Width: 0.9 Blocks Phantoms are flying undead hostile mobs that spawn in the night sky when the player has not laid in a bed or died for three or more in-game days.\n\nThey attack by diving at the player from the sky to bite them.\n\nUsually, they appear in trios.\n\nTwo phantoms at night.\n\nPhantoms spawn unless the game rule doInsomnia is set to false.\n\nThe spawning mechanics differ between Java and Bedrock editions.\n\nIn both editions, they spawn in the Overworld above the player if the \"Time Since Last Rest\" statistic is at least 1 hour (72000 ticks or 3 in-game days).\n\n[verify ] This statistic is reset when the player dies or enters a bed.\n\nFurthermore, the player must not have a block overhead that blocks light in any way; for example, leaves prevent phantoms from spawning as they have a light opacity of 2, but glass does not, as its light opacity is 0.\n\nPhantoms do not spawn in Spectator mode, [JE only ] but they do spawn in Creative mode.\n\n[1] Phantom spawning is similar to other monsters spawning: the spawn location must have a light level of 7 or less, and spawns are limited by the monster population cap.\n\nPhantoms are also subject to a density cap of 5.\n\nPhantom spawn attempts are made on surface blocks throughout the same spawn radius as other monsters.\n\nHowever, when a phantom spawn attempt succeeds the phantom appears somewhere in a 21\u00d715\u00d721 cube centered 28 blocks above the player instead of at the block where the spawn attempt occurred.\n\nPhantoms attempt to spawn every 1\u20132 minutes.\n\nThey spawn only if it is night or a thunderstorm is happening, the player is above sea level (y=64) with sky access, and the local difficulty is greater than a randomly chosen value between 0.0 and 3.0.\n\nThe chance of a successful spawn is x \u221272000 \u2044 x, where x is the number of ticks since the player last entered a bed or died.\n\nThis roughly comes to a 1 \u2044 4 (25.0%) chance on day 4, a 2 \u2044 5 (40.0%) chance on day 5, a 3 \u2044 6 (1 \u2044 2) (50.0%) chance on day 6, 4 \u2044 7 (about 57.1%) chance on day 7, and so on.\n\nIf all conditions are met, a group of phantoms attempt to spawn 20\u201334 blocks above the player, and off to the side by a taxicab distance of up to 10 blocks.\n\nThe number of phantoms spawned is 1-2 in Easy difficulty, 1-3 in Normal, and 1-4 in Hard.\n\nPhantoms can spawn inside buildings, if the player is outside and the building is both near enough and the building has a large enough cavity for them to spawn inside.\n\nPhantoms are counted toward the hostile mob cap, but they don't adhere to it when spawning.\n\n[2] Their spawning mechanic is based on the location of players in the world rather than by chance, unlike regular mob spawning.\n\nPhantom spawning is completely independent of the biome, meaning they can spawn in biomes that normally prevent hostile mob spawning such as mushroom fields [3] and the void [4].\n\nPhantoms increase in number every consecutive night a player hasn't entered a bed and stop spawning when the player lies down in bed.\n\nPhantoms drop when killed: 0\u20131 phantom membrane s when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nLooting increases the maximum drops by 1 per level, for a maximum of 4 with Looting III.\n\n5 when killed by the player or a tamed wolf.\n\nA phantom swooping at the player.\n\nWhen idle, phantoms fly around in a roughly circular pattern within 15 to 25 blocks of a player horizontally and within 24 to 35 blocks of a player vertically, leaving a trail of gray smoke while doing so.\n\nTheir movement speed is one of the fastest of any mob, up to 20 blocks per second.\n\nThey have a large search radius, targeting and following players from 64 blocks away [BE only ] [more information needed ].\n\nOnce every 10-20 seconds [BE only ] [more information needed ] they swoop down or up quickly to attack.\n\nIf stopped or hurt during this action, the phantom retreats back to its original elevation.\n\nWhen a path to its original elevation is obstructed by a block, the phantom continues attempting to return to its original elevation until it either attacks or moves out from under the block.\n\nPhantoms do not attack an exposed player sleeping in a bed.\n\nPhantoms can move through water at their normal speed.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a phantom underwater attempts to fly to the surface, and dies from drowning after 20 seconds if trapped underwater.\n\nPhantoms do not drown in Java Edition.\n\nA phantom's body disappears when under the Invisibility effect, but its eyes and smoke particles are still visible.\n\nCats hiss at phantoms that are currently attacking players, and phantoms try to stay at least 64 blocks away from them.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, phantoms also avoid ocelots in the same manner.\n\nLike other undead mobs, phantoms are harmed by the Instant Health effect, healed by the Instant Damage effect, immune to the Poison and Regeneration effects, ignored by the wither, and affected by the Smite enchantment.\n\nLike zombies and skeletons, phantoms burn in sunlight.\n\nThey burn even when equipped with helmets through commands.\n\n[5] Java Edition: Phantoms use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Phantoms have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities

always have a constant 20 \u00d7 10 HP, and deal 6 + Size damage.\n\nNaturally spawned phantoms are always size 0.\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Phantom\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe red phantom design was scrapped because it looked like a Nether mob.\n\nAt one point before the release of 18w10a, the phantom texture was made red, but it was decided that it appeared too much like a Nether mob.\n\n[8] The phantom was originally going to have a mouth, like the drawing shown during MINECON Earth, but it was eventually scrapped because \"it looked so much like a muppet\".\n\n[8] Earlier designs can be seen on Minecraft 's Instagram account.\n\n[9] The sounds of the phantom were taken from Samuel \u00c5berg 's baby son screaming.\n\n[10] Despite that they are flying mobs, phantoms can destroy turtle eggs when on top of them.\n\n[11] The game rule that modify Phantom spawning (doInsomnia) is probably the reference to the condition of spawning Phantom since \"Insomnia\" means \"the state of unable to sleep\".\n\nA phantom under the Invisibility effect.\n\nPhantoms exposed

In Bedrock Edition:' Height: 1.9 blocks.\n\nWidth: 0.6 blocks Skeletons are undead common hostile mobs that perform ranged attacks with a bow by shooting arrows.\n\nA skeleton may spawn above a solid block at a light level of zero in the Overworld except in mushroom fields and deep dark biomes, usually in small groups of up to four skeletons in Java Edition or two skeletons in Bedrock Edition.\n\n80% of skeletons spawned directly under the sky in snowy plains, ice spikes, frozen oceans, deep frozen oceans and legacy frozen oceans biomes spawn as stray mobs.\n\nSpiders have a very low chance of 1% to spawn with a skeleton riding them, creating a spider jockey.\n\nFour skeleton horsemen spawn when a skeleton horse trap is triggered, typically during a thunderstorm.\n\nThe skeletons ride on skeleton horses and are equipped with enchanted bows and iron helmets and, in Java Edition, have damage immunity for 3 seconds after spawning.\n\nSkeletons spawn from 25% of the monster spawners found in monster rooms.\n\nSkeletons spawn commonly in soul sand valleys, biomes of the Nether.\n\nHowever, existing skeletons lower the spawning chances of other hostile mobs nearby, meaning there are much less skeletons in a given area compared to zombified piglins in nether wastes.\n\nIn nether fortresses structures, there is a 20% chance that a skeleton spawns in place of a wither skeleton.\n\nA skeleton drops upon death: From zero to two bone s.\n\nThe maximum drop is increased by one per level of Looting, for a maximum of zero to five bones with Looting at the level three.\n\nFrom zero to two arrow s.\n\nThe maximum drop is increased by one per level of Looting, for a maximum of zero to five arrows with Looting at the level three.\n\nAny naturally spawned equipment, naturally its damaged and sometimes enchanted bow, has an 8.5% chance of dropping if killed by the player or a tamed wolf (9.5% with Looting one, 10.5% with Looting two and 11.5% with Looting three).\n\nPicked-up items always drop and drop with the same damage level it had when picked up.\n\nA skeleton skull if killed by a charged creeper 's explosion.\n\n5 experience orbs when killed by a player or a tamed wolf, and an extra 1\u20133 experience orbs for each piece of natural equipment that does not drop upon death.\n\nBecause all skeletons spawn with at least a bow, this leaves an unarmored skeleton dropping 6\u20138 experience orbs if it doesn't drop its bow upon death.\n\nIf the skeleton does drop its bow, it drops the default 5 experience orbs instead.\n\nSkeletons chase players, baby turtles and iron golems they see within 16 blocks, climbing stairs or ladders, navigating mazes and traversing other complex obstacles to get within their shooting range.\n\nA skeleton shooting.\n\nWhen within 15 blocks of a target and with a clear line of sight, the skeleton starts shooting with arrows, once every two seconds on easy and normal difficulties or once every second on hard difficulty.\n\nIf the player leaves the 15-block radius, skeletons wait for some seconds with the bow charged, shooting the moment the player comes within range again.\n\nTheir detection range is reduced by 50% if a skeleton skull is worn by the player.\n\nThis stacks with sneaking and the Invisibility effect.\n\nThe skeleton's accuracy is based on the world difficulty.\n\nSkeletons have an \"error\" of 10 on Easy, 6 on Normal and 2 on Hard.\n\nThis is compared to the player's lack of accuracy of 1.\n\nTo account for gravity, skeletons aim 0.2 blocks higher for every horizontal block of range to the target.\n\nSkeletons have infinite durability on their bows, and can shoot an infinite amount of arrows.\n\nArrows shot by skeletons cannot be picked up from the ground.\n\nSkeleton behavior varies between the game editions: Java Edition Strafe in circular patterns to dodge attacks and retreat to a safe range if the player comes within 4 blocks.\n\nThey sometimes walk off cliffs while strafing.\n\n[1] Sprint toward the player if they are 14 blocks away or farther.\n\nUse bows even underwater.\n\nThe water slows down the arrows.\n\nAnimates its bow while attacking.\n\nBedrock Edition Skeletons typically stop moving to shoot, making no attempt to avoid being hit.\n\nAn underwater skeleton uses a melee attack because it is unable to use a bow underwater.\n\nA skeleton on land shoots quickly at a player in water.\n\nThe rate of fire increases as the player approaches, making combat difficult due to the knockback.\n\nIn most cases, if a skeleton's arrow hits a neutral or hostile mob that has not yet been attacked by the player, the mob attacks the skeleton.\n\nWhen a skeleton is attacked by another mob (including another skeleton), it attacks that mob, reorienting on the player once the mob is dead.\n\nSkeletons flee from wolves.\n\nA skeleton runs from a chasing wolf until the wolf deals damage, after which the skeleton turns to shoot at the wolf that successfully attacked it.\n\nDueling skeletons.\n\nOne skeleton turned red from being shot by the other skeleton.\n\nSkeletons sink in water and cannot swim, but do not drown.\n\nIf a skeleton is inside of powder snow for 7 seconds, it converts into a stray.\n\nA newly-converted stray always has full health even if converted from a damaged skeleton.\n\nThe converted stray keeps any items worn or held when it was a skeleton.\n\nOnly skeletons can become strays; wither skeletons cannot be converted.\n\nWolves attacking a skeleton.\n\nIf spawned with a weapon other than a bow, or no weapon at all (which can be spawned with commands such as / summon skeleton ~ ~ ~ {HandItems:[{Count:1,id:\"iron_sword\"}]}, or / summon skeleton ~ ~ ~ {}), a skeleton charges at a player with arms outstretched and deals damage by touch, similar to a wither skeleton.\n\nA skeleton holding a tipped arrow in its off-hand always shoots that type of arrow, and the arrow held is not consumed.\n\nIf a creeper dies from a skeleton's arrow, it drops one of any music discs except for Pigstep, Otherside, 5, and Relic.\n\nA skeleton burning in sunlight.\n\nSkeletons burn at dawn when the sun is 15 degrees or greater above the ground and when the moon can no longer be seen, unless the skeleton is: Below an opaque block.\n\nIn a sunlight level of 11 or less.\n\nIn water.\n\nStanding in soul sand.\n\nAffected by Fire Resistance.\n\nWearing a helmet, which absorbs the damage, wearing out completely after a long time, usually several day cycles.\n\nStanding in cobwebs.\n\n[2] If not wearing a helmet, it seeks out shade during the day or enters water to protect itself.\n\nUnlike zombies, which leave the shade to chase a player, skeletons do not exit the shaded area even while attacking.\n\nSkeletons are undead mobs, causing them to be damaged by the Instant Health status effect, healed by the Instant Damage status effect, and unaffected by the status effects Regeneration and Poison.\n\nSkeletons are ignored by the wither and are affected by the Smite enchantment.\n\nSome spawned skeletons have the ability to pick up dropped items from the ground.\n\nUnlike zombies, however, they pick up only weapons or armor.\n\nIf a picked up item is armor, a carved pumpkin or a mob head, a skeleton equips itself with the item.\n\nIf the picked up item is a weapon, the skeleton uses the item as a melee weapon.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, skeletons can also pick up and equip illager banners worn in their chest slot.\n\nSkeletons spawn already-armed with bows, which may be enchanted.\n\nThe chances of that event are listed below from code.\n\nIf a skeleton spawns wearing multiple pieces of armor, the armor is never mismatched (all pieces are made of the same material) except if it is spawned as part of a skeleton trap, in which case only the iron helmet may not match the rest of the armor.\n\n\u2191 a b c d e f g h i Value is based on the regional difficulty.\n\n\u2191 100% chance of a bow \u2191 a b Enchantment is the same as on an enchantment table at level 5\u201322.\n\n[note 1] If a skeleton does spawn with armor, the chances of specific armor are as follows: In Java Edition, the armor pieces go from feet to head, and in Bedrock Edition, they go from head to feet.\n\nThe chances of it being of a particular material are: The armor is not damaged from most damage sources; it cannot \"wear out\" the way player armor does.\n\nHelmets (not blocks like carved pumpkins) on skeletons can break if the skeleton is exposed to daylight or has an anvil or other falling block dropped on its hitbox.\n\nIf a skeleton has a bow and a sword is given, it drops the bow, with the same chance as if killed with Looting I and starts using the sword.\n\nIf a skeleton has a sword or bow in its hand, and one of a better type or with better enchantments is given, the skeleton drops the existing weapon, with the same chance as if killed with Looting I in favor of the better one.\n\nAny skeleton that spawns with equipment (picked-up items do not count) gives 1\u20133 extra experience points per item.\n\nIf multiple viable items exist, the skeleton endlessly picks up and drops the items.\n\n[3] On Halloween, skeletons may spawn wearing a carved pumpkin or jack o'lantern.\n\nThey do not drop this, even when killed with Looting.\n\nJava Edition: Skeletons use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: \u2191 MCPE-53297 Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Skeletons have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs StrayConversionTime: The number of ticks until this skeleton converts to a stray (default value is -1, when no conversion is under way).\n\nBedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nHistorical sounds: Issues relating to \"Skeleton\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nIf alerted to a player 's presence, a skeleton can fire arrows backward, occasionally hitting themselves.\n\nSkeletons cannot see the player through glass, fences, or other transparent blocks.\n\nSkeletons and their variants do not know how to use a crossbow, despite the same using method as a bow.\n\nThe artificial intelligence of skeletons in Bedrock Edition is a mix of skeleton AI from Java Edition between versions 1.5 and 1.8.9 and the skeletons in Update Aquatic.\n\nThey shoot faster when they are on land and the target underwater, causing knockback enough to make combat hard.\n\nAdditionally, they do not strafe left to right, and they shoot more rapidly at closer targets.\n\nSkeletons also use ranged attacks on land and switch to melee attacks when sinking underwater.\n\nIn Java Edition, 89% of skeletons hold their bow in their right hand and 11% with the left.\n\nThis reflects estimated handedness percentages in the real world.\n\nIf a skeleton has a sword or any other melee item, generally with commands, its AI resembles the wither skeleton 's AI.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, skeletons do not animate their bow.\n\nC418 used bamboo wind chime sounds as a base for the skeleton sounds.\n\n[5] This page would benefit from the addition of

[Java Edition only ] When spawned, the wither grows larger in size as its health bar fills up.\n\nWhile in this state, the wither is invulnerable, and neither moves nor attacks.\n\nWhen this state ends (after 11 seconds), the wither creates a large explosion centered on itself, destroying nearby blocks and dealing up to 68 \u00d7 34 damage to nearby mobs and players, depending on difficulty.\n\nThis explosion has a blast power of 7, more than that of a charged creeper or an end crystal.\n\nIt is accompanied by a loud gruesome sound that can be heard equally from across the map and in all dimensions [JE only ].\n\n[1] After this, the wither attacks nearby mobs and can take damage.\n\nThe wither has the greatest natural health of all mobs in Minecraft (exceeded by the warden, while Bedrock Edition 's wither still has the highest health), at 300 \u00d7 150 in Java Edition or 600 \u00d7 300 in Bedrock Edition.\n\nThe wither is immune to fire, lava, drowning damage, and freezing.\n\nLike other undead mobs, the wither is harmed by the Instant Health effect and healed by the Instant Damage effect as well as affected by weapons with the Smite enchantment.\n\nIt is immune to all other status effects, like the ender dragon.\n\nUpon taking damage, the wither breaks all blocks within a 3\u00d74\u00d73 area around it, including blast-resistant blocks like obsidian, crying obsidian, and ancient debris, dropping them as items if possible.\n\nThe wither is the only mob in the game that can destroy obsidian.\n\nThe wither cannot break the following blocks: Barrier Bedrock End Portal End Portal Frame End Gateway Command Block Structure Block Jigsaw Block Light Block Moving Piston Moving Block  [Bedrock Edition only ] Reinforced Deepslate In Java Edition, these blocks are listed under the wither_immune tag.\n\nThe wither attacking a villager.\n\nThe wither's block-breaking behavior makes suffocation ineffective under most circumstances.\n\nHowever, the blocks listed above, as well as some natural structures that include them, can be used to suffocate the wither due to their wither immunity.\n\nThe wither is hostile toward all mobs except: Undead mobs Zombies and their variants Skeletons and their variants Zombified piglin s Skeleton horse s and zombie horse s Phantom Zoglin Other withers Ghast s [2] Mobs with the Invulnerable NBT tag.\n\nIf the wither is idle, it simply hovers and is unable to gain altitude.\n\nOn Normal or Hard difficulty, it fires blue skulls in random directions until it finds a target.\n\nThe wither's boss health bar color depends on the edition: Dark purple on Java Edition, or pink on Bedrock Edition.\n\nIt appears only when a player is looking in the wither's direction, including through walls.\n\nAll withers display a boss bar on the screen.\n\nRenamed withers display the changed name above its boss bar.\n\nThe sky darkens when the wither spawns (a kind of fog).\n\nWither with 'wither armor' effect, after half health depleted.\n\nUpon noticing a mob, the wither hovers above it and rapidly shoots black wither skulls.\n\nEach head fires independently, allowing a wither to attack up to three different mobs/ players at the same time.\n\nThe main head controls the wither's movement and has a 0.1% chance to shoot a blue wither skull instead of the default black one.\n\nWhenever a wither kills another mob, a wither rose is planted if the ground is grass block, dirt, coarse dirt, moss block, mud, netherrack, soul sand, or soul soil on Java Edition, or otherwise dropped as an item at that mob's location; however, it may be destroyed by other wither skulls.\n\nWither roses are planted/dropped even when the game rule doMobLoot is set to false.\n\n[3] The wither has a passive regeneration rate of 1 every 20 ticks (1 second), and a direct killing blow on a target instantly heals 5.\n\nWhen its health drops below half (150 \u00d7 75), the wither gains a natural \"wither armor\" effect, which makes it immune to damage from arrows and thrown tridents and causes it to fly at the same height as the target.\n\nThe armor disappears if it regenerates above half health.\n\nUpon noticing a player or mob, the wither flies to a random location and hovers in place.\n\nIt shoots 3 black wither skulls and one blue wither skull before flying to another location.\n\nThe time between each shot decreases as the wither loses health.\n\nOn Normal difficulty or higher, if the wither has targeted an entity but cannot find a location to pathfind to, it shoots random blue skulls in a random direction along with the skulls directed toward the target.\n\nWhen a wither reaches halfway of its total health, it causes a large explosion that spawns 3 wither skeletons (except on Easy difficulty), as well as gaining wither armor.\n\nInstead of flying to a random location, it dashes toward its target, destroying blocks and damaging mobs in its path.\n\nIt also fires up to 4 skulls per burst: three black skulls followed by one blue skull.\n\nIt has different spawn and death animations, both of which involve the wither exploding.\n\nWither roses always drop as an item when the wither kills a mob.\n\nWither roses are dropped even when the game rule doMobLoot is set to false.\n\n[4] The wither rose inflicts the Wither effect for a couple of seconds when stepped on.\n\nThe sky light level drops to 11 and dark clouds appear from the moment the wither spawns until it is dead, preventing zombies, skeletons, and drowned from burning in sunlight.\n\nOn Easy difficulty, the wither does not inflict the wither effect or summon wither skeletons.\n\nWithers will retain their anti-projectile armor after healing it over 1/2 of its total HP (301 \u00d7 150.5), though it disappears after the game is restarted.\n\n[5] Not to be confused with Wither Skeleton Skull.\n\nWither Skull Normal Dangerous Behavior Does not exist Details Size Height: 0.3125 Blocks Width: 0.3125 Blocks When attacking, the wither rapidly fires explosive projectiles called wither skulls, which look like its own heads, at its target.\n\nThere are two types of wither skulls: a fast-moving black one, and a slower blue one.\n\nBlack wither skulls explode with a blast power of 1, the same as a ghast 's fireball, and cannot break blocks with a blast resistance above 4.\n\nBlue wither skulls have the same explosion strength, but move slower and are more destructive to terrain.\n\nBlue wither skulls break all breakable blocks (including obsidian, ancient debris, and blocks of netherite), but cannot break unbreakable blocks like bedrock, end portal frames, and reinforced deepslate.\n\nIn Minecraft Education, blue wither skulls deal increased damage, but with the same explosion radius.\n\nIf either type of wither skull hits a player or mob, it does 8 damage on Normal difficulty.\n\nIt also inflicts Wither II for 10 seconds on Normal difficulty and 40 seconds on Hard, which turns the player's hearts black () and drains health, similarly to Poison.\n\nHowever, unlike Poison, it can kill the player.\n\nLike other status effects, the Wither effect can be cured by drinking milk.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition and Legacy Console Edition, the blue skull can be deflected by hitting it with an empty hand, weapon, tool, or throwable projectiles such as tridents, arrows, snowballs, and throwable potions.\n\nJava Edition: Withers use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nWither skulls use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 MC-212623 \u2191 Does not trigger at all if the gamerule globalSoundEvents is false \u2191 MC-177741 Bedrock Edition: \u2191 Is normally 1.0, but can be 0.75

Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Wither\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe painting depicting how to spawn a wither According to Jeb, the wither was inspired by Terraria, which has a summonable boss mechanic.\n\nThe name itself is inspired by a poison spell in another game made by Jeb called Whispers in Akarra.\n\n[10] There is a painting showing the soul sand and wither skeleton skull formation needed to spawn a wither.\n\nIf the wither is damaged by the Void, it frantically attempts to fire blue skulls.\n\nAbove half health, the wither always attempts to stay a few blocks above the mob it is targeting.\n\nThis means that attempting to build or climb up to hit the wither using a sword is essentially impossible.\n\nIf the wither is after a blaze and the blaze tries to fly up to it, the wither attempts to keep rising above the blaze, thus making both of them rise higher until they hit a ceiling or until the blaze despawns or dies.\n\nAlthough the wither is 3.5 blocks tall, 3 blocks wide, and 1 block thick, its hitbox is only 3.5 blocks tall, 1 block wide, and 1 block thick.\n\nThe true dimensions of the wither are: 2.844 blocks tall (varies), 3 blocks wide, and 1.719 blocks long (also varies).\n\nThe wither appears on the four sides of chiseled red sandstone.\n\nThe wither's smaller heads shoot targets slightly slower than the main head.\n\nThe interval for smaller heads is 2\u20133 seconds, while the main head's always 2.\n\nAn enemy called the wither storm appears in Minecraft: Story Mode.\n\nIt was created by replacing the center block of soul sand with a command block.\n\nDespite not having visible feet, withers are still capable of making footstep sounds.\n\n[11] In Java Edition 3D Shareware v1.34, withers drop red keys.\n\nAccording to Quinn Richter, Marketplace Partner Manager, the wither's name is \"Simmons?\", similar to the ender dragon's name being \"Jean?\".\n\n[12] A wither skull can be deflected by shooting an arrow at it. [Bedrock Edition only ] If a deflected wither skull hits the wither, the wither takes damage. [Bedrock Edition only ] A wither and an ender dragon can engage in combat, but neither one damages the other.\n\nDespite being immune to projectiles when it has \"wither armor\", it is still able to be hit by the warden 's sonic boom attack.\n\nThis is because the warden's sonic boom attack is not a projectile, but an instant damage attack.\n\nTherefore, the wither is unable to defend against it with the \"armor\".\n\nThe withering effect after being damaged by a wither skull.\n\nThe \"wither armor\" that blocks arrows.\n\nThe wither and its armor.\n\nA larger image to show how to summon the wither.\n\nThe wither prepares for explosion with the invulnerable status after summoned.\n\nThe pit created after the wither has charged.\n\nThe wither attacking horses.\n\nThe wither's texture.\n\nWither attacking a sheep.\n\nWither attacking a village.\n\nA wither summoning setup.\n\nImage from Dinnerbone of a wither being built horizontally.\n\nA player avoiding a wither by using the Invisibility effect.\n\nFirst image of a wither being built in Bedrock Edition.\n\nWither in promotional artwork for the Pretty Scary Update.\n\nWither Storm, a variant of Wither as it appears on Minecraft: Story Mode.\n\nWither pictured in the Mobestiary.\n\nLEGO Minecraft wither.\n\n\"Acid Wither,\" an official T-Shirt design.\n\n\"Jolly Mobs Flying Head,\" another T-Shirt design.\n\nEnder dragon, the other boss mob in Minecraft Tutorials/Defeating the wither, a tutorial explaining different tactics to fight and kill the wither \u2191 MC-177741 \u2014 Wither sounds play for all players \u2191 MC-162557 \u2014 \"Withers no longer attack ghasts\" \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 MC-154922 \u2191 MCPE-73842 \u2191 MCPE-161643 \u2013 After healing a wither boss over 1/2 HP, it still retains its anti-projectile shield \u2191 \"Minecraft 1.4 - How to Spawn Wither Mob - Mojang PAX 2012 Live @ 3:07\" \u2013 Accelerated Ideas on YouTube \u2191 http://www.twitch.tv/pax2/b/330745811 (at 3:57:47) \u2191 MC-29274 \u2191 MC-189872 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 https://minecraft.net/article/meet-wither \u2191 MC-92623 \u2191 \"Ask Mojang #4: To The Moon!\n\n@ 3:40\" \u2013 Minecraft on YouTube, November 8, 2019 Meet the Wither \u2013 Minecraft.net on February 13, 2017 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

[JE only ] The detection range of zombies is reduced to half of their normal range (17.5 blocks) when the player is wearing a zombie head.\n\nIf a zombie sees a player and a villager together, the zombie prefers to attack the player first.\n\nA zombie already hunting a villager continues to do so even if the player is near, until the player attacks it.\n\nZombies periodically make groaning sounds, which can be heard up to 16 blocks away.\n\nZombies attempt to avoid obstacles, including fall damage, fire, lava, magma blocks, and cactus and try to find the shortest path toward the player.\n\n[1] Unlike skeletons, zombies do not try to avoid being hit and continue to pursue the player even when being attacked.\n\nZombies attack baby turtles and actively seek out and destroy turtle eggs within 24 blocks horizontally and 3 blocks vertically, by jumping on them until they crack and break.\n\nZombies hunt and attack golem utility mobs within 42 blocks.\n\nIron golems and snow golems attack zombies without provocation, although snow golems deal only knockback to zombies with their snowballs.\n\nZombies target and hunt villagers within a 35\u2013 to 52.5\u2013block radius (depending on regional difficulty) [Java Edition only ] or a 16-block radius [Bedrock Edition only ] and they can always see villagers through walls.\n\nIf a zombie is attacking a villager and sees the player, it interrupts its attack on the villager to attack the player instead, even if the player has not attacked it [JE only ].\n\nOnce a zombie has targeted a villager, the zombie ignores any other villagers and the player, until its target is dead or the zombie is attacked [JE only ].\n\nAny zombie variant can transform a villager into a zombie villager.\n\nThe probability depends on the difficulty: 0% chance in Peaceful (no zombies spawn) and Easy 50% chance in Normal 100% chance in Hard Zombies target and hunt wandering traders within 35 blocks and can see traders through walls.\n\nThe zombie focuses solely on the trader unless it's attacked, or if either it or the target is killed or moved out of range, or if the trader is under the invisibility status effect.\n\nA zombie breaking down a wooden oak door.\n\nThe zombie can break only the top half of the door, not the bottom half.\n\nWhen the sun is 15 degrees or more above the ground, zombies burn once exposed to direct sunlight.\n\nBurning is suppressed when the zombie is: in a sufficiently shaded area: a sunlight level of 11 or less (a 1 block roof overhang provides sufficient protection even if it would have a sunlight level of 14); in water; wearing head armor (the helmet absorbs the damage from light but may take several day cycles to wear out completely).\n\nunder the status effect of Fire Resistance.\n\nstanding in cobwebs.\n\n[2] Transparent and translucent blocks, including glass and ice, do not prevent them from burning. [JE only ].\n\nIf they attack an entity while burning, they may set it on fire, with a (30\u00d7 regional difficulty)% chance and with a 2\u00d7floor (regional difficulty) second duration.\n\nIf wearing armor enchanted with Thorns while burning, they may set players attacking them on fire with thorns damage alone.\n\nZombies are undead mobs, harmed by the status effect Healing, healed by the status effect Instant Damage and are unaffected by Regeneration and Poison.\n\nThe wither does not attack zombies.\n\nZombies are affected by the Smite enchantment.\n\nSome zombies are capable of automatically picking up dropped items that they come across.\n\nMob heads and carved pumpkins are automatically worn on their heads.\n\nZombies can equip armor, weapons or tools.\n\nIf a zombie encounters another similar item, it may drop the previous item in favor of the new one, if: the new item is armor or a sword and the old item was not (for example, zombies prefer swords to pickaxes, and helmets to carved pumpkins), both items are armor/swords and the new item is better damage-wise (reduces higher damage for armor, or inflicts more damage for swords), both items are armor/swords with the same damage reduction/infliction, the new item has NBT tags while the old does not or the new item is more damaged than the old item, or both items are bows and the new item has NBT tags while the old does not.\n\nItems dropped by mobs in exchange for another cannot be picked up by players or mobs for 10 game ticks (0.5 seconds, barring lag), but can be picked up by hoppers.\n\nA zombie holding a picked-up item does not despawn when left alone, similar to being name tagged.\n\nZombies have a higher chance of being able to pick up items in Hard difficulty.\n\nPicked-up items do not cause the zombie to drop more experience when killed, unlike naturally-spawned gear.\n\nUp to 10% of zombies (depending on regional difficulty) in pursuit of a target bang on closed wooden doors and on Hard (and Hardcore) difficulty can succeed in breaking them down.\n\nOtherwise, the door cracks but does not break.\n\nA zombie choosing to break the door down instead of taking an alternative path.\n\nThe zombie also breaks down the door if the door is blocking its way.\n\nZombies can break only the top half of a door, meaning they cannot break a door if the zombie is facing the bottom half of the door.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Java Edition.\n\nOn all difficulty levels, damaged zombie mobs (including husks, drowned and even zombified piglins [3]) call all other zombies within a 67\u00d721\u00d767 to 111\u00d721\u00d7111 area [n 1] centered on the attacked zombie to target the attacker.\n\nIn Hard difficulty, zombies can spawn additional zombies to \"help\" when damaged.\n\nEach zombie has a \"likeliness to call reinforcements\" statistic ranging from 0\u201310%, and \"leader\" zombies (0\u20135% depending on regional difficulty) get a bonus of 50\u201375 percentage points to the stat.\n\nWhen the zombie is damaged by an entity or is damaged while targeting an entity, up to 50 attempts are made to randomly choose a spawn location (0 or \u00b17\u201340 blocks away in all three axes) that is above a block with a solid top surface, has light level 0, has no players within 7 blocks, and has no colliding entities or blocks at which to spawn the reinforcement.\n\nBoth the damaged zombie and the new zombie has a 5 percentage point penalty to their \"likeliness to call reinforcement\" stat, preventing infinite zombies from spawning this way.\n\nZombie reinforcements can spawn even in locations where naturally spawned zombies can't spawn, like mushroom fields, the End, and the Nether [4], although they still cannot spawn on blocks where other items like redstone dust or pressure plates are placed.\n\nThese effects can be negated by killing the zombie in as few hits as possible, by using environmental damage such as cactus or lava, or by avoiding them completely.\n\nThat is, if the zombified mob drops experience, it has a chance to spawn reinforcements.\n\nAdditionally, reinforcements do not spawn at all, even on Hard difficulty, if the game rule doMobSpawning is set to false.\n\nLeader zombies are a special type of zombie that spawn with an added 50-75% chance to spawn reinforcements.\n\nThe chance of a leader zombie spawning increases with clamped regional difficulty, up to a 5% chance of spawning.\n\nReinforcements zombies spawn regardless of the hostile mob cap.\n\nThey also spawn on the north-west corner of the designated block, instead of the center of the block like natural mob spawning does.\n\n[5] Zombies spawned as reinforcements cannot be zombie villagers, but they can be babies, including chicken jockeys.\n\nA husk that suffocates in water converts to a zombie.\n\nA zombie that suffocates in water converts into a drowned.\n\nIf a zombie's head is submerged in water for 30 seconds, it begins converting into a drowned.\n\nThe zombie shakes, similar to a zombie villager being cured and, after 15 seconds, the zombie becomes drowned.\n\nOnce this process starts, it cannot be stopped even if the zombie leaves water.\n\nThis time is not affected by the Respiration enchantment or the Water Breathing status effect.\n\nA newly-converted drowned always has full health even if converted from a damaged zombie.\n\nAn item being held or worn by a zombie when it becomes drowned, whether it was picked up or naturally spawned, has a 100% drop rate, which includes any naturally spawned equipment dropping with full durability [BE only ].\n\nOnly normal zombies can become drowned; zombie villagers and zombified piglins cannot be converted.\n\n[6] Husks, however, convert into zombies if they drown, and then this zombie converts into a drowned as does a normal zombie.\n\nAny husks that convert into zombies also have full health, even if the drowned husk is damaged.\n\nJava

remains persistent but is excluded from the mob cap.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition all zombified villagers are persistent.\n\nA zombie villager appears alongside a cleric villager in every igloo basement (a normal zombie villager in Bedrock Edition  [until BE 1.20.30 ] and a cleric zombie villager in Java Edition  [upcoming: BE 1.20.30 ]).\n\nOne of them transforms into a leatherworker, due to the workstation (a cauldron).\n\nThey also generate as part of abandoned villages.\n\nZombie villagers generated in both of these structures do not despawn naturally.\n\nAll mobs that can be ridden by baby zombie villagers in Bedrock Edition.\n\nBaby zombie villagers make up 5% of zombie villager spawns.\n\nThey have big heads, unlike normal baby villagers.\n\nThey behave similarly to regular zombie villagers, with the following differences: They are 30% faster than normal zombies, yet they have the same health as normal zombies.\n\nThis makes baby zombie villagers more dangerous than their bigger counterparts.\n\nThe noises they make are higher-pitched than adult zombie villager sound effects.\n\nIn Java Edition, baby zombie villagers have a chance to spawn as a chicken jockey.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, 10% of naturally spawned baby zombie villagers can start riding a mob and become a jockey when it tries attacking a villager, player, or golem.\n\nThey can ride: Adult chickens Untamed ocelots Untamed cats Untamed wolves Adult zombies Adult husks Adult zombified villagers Adult zombified piglins Cows Adult unsaddled pigs Sheep Adult untamed horses Adult untamed donkeys Adult untamed mules Adult skeleton horses Adult zombie horses Mooshrooms Spiders that was not spawned as a jockey mount Cave spiders that was not spawned as a jockey mount Pandas Baby zombie villagers turn into baby villagers, if cured.\n\nIn Java Edition, their heads turn back to small baby villager heads.\n\nWorn armor shrinks to fit their body size.\n\nThey are able to fit through 1\u00d71 block gaps.\n\nThey drop 12 experience when killed by the player instead of 5.\n\nUnlike most other baby mobs in the game, they stay as babies indefinitely and never grow into \"adult\" zombie villagers.\n\nThey have a decreased hitbox size.\n\nBaby zombie villagers are spawned when a zombie kills a baby villager, the chance of infection being the same as adult zombie villagers.\n\nBaby zombie villagers also spawn naturally, but the combined chance (5% villagers \u00d7 5% babies) is low at 0.25% (or 1 in 400 chance) of all newly spawned zombies.\n\nAlong with skeletons and regular zombies, some zombie villagers are capable of picking up dropped items.\n\nThese zombie villagers automatically pick up and hold any item that they come across (except jack o'lanterns  [Java Edition only ], mob heads and pumpkins, as these are worn on their heads), and use any armor, weapons, or tools picked up.\n\nIf they encounter another similar item, they pick it up and drop their previous item: if the new item is armor or a sword and the old item was not (for example, zombie villagers prefer swords to pickaxes and helmets to pumpkins), if both items are armor/swords and the new item is better damage-wise (reduces more damage for armor, or inflicts more damage for swords), if both items are armor/swords with the same damage reduction/infliction, the new item has NBT tags while the old does not or the new item is more damaged than the old item, or if both items are bows and the new item has NBT tags while the old does not.\n\nItems dropped by mobs in exchange for another cannot be picked up by players or mobs for 10 game ticks (0.5 seconds, barring lag), but can be picked up by hoppers.\n\nArmor worn by zombie villagers is not damaged from most damage sources, which means it cannot \"wear out\" the way player armor does.\n\nHelmets (not blocks like pumpkins) on zombie villagers can wear away and break if the zombie villager is exposed to daylight, or has an anvil or other falling block dropped on its head.\n\nZombie villagers also have a natural armor rating of 2 (), which gives 1.6 - 8% damage reduction from most sources.\n\nSome zombie villagers that are capable of picking up items spawn already in possession of such items, and those items may also be enchanted.\n\nThe chances of that event are listed below.\n\nIf a zombie villager spawns wearing multiple pieces of armor, the armor is never mismatched (i.e.\n\nall pieces are made of the same material).\n\n\u2191 a b c d e f g h i Value is based on the regional difficulty.\n\n\u2191 a b Enchantment is the same as on an enchantment table at level 5\u201322.\n\n[note 1] \u2191 1 \u2044 3 chance of an iron sword, 2 \u2044 3 chance of an iron shovel If a zombie does spawn with armor, the chances of specific armor are as follows: The chances of it being of a particular material are: Any zombie villager that spawns with equipment (picked-up items don't count) drop 1\u20133 extra experience per item.\n\nIn Java Edition  [upcoming: BE 1.20.30 ], a zombie villager retains its biome and profession after conversion from a villager.\n\nThey also retain their trades.\n\nBelow is a table of the variant and what workstation it required before zombification.\n\nThe zombie villager cannot work at a job site block.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, zombie villagers do not display their professions, but they still have the same profession after curing as before zombification.\n\nThey use the texture of an unemployed villager from their corresponding biome.\n\nBelow is a table listing the various professions, along with the specific job site block that each profession requires: \u2191 In Bedrock Edition  [until BE 1.20.30 ], all naturally spawned zombie villagers use the unemployed textures.\n\nWhen they die, zombie villagers drop 0\u20132 rotten flesh.\n\nThe maximum drop is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-5 with Looting III.\n\nThey can also drop an iron ingot, carrot, or potato when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nThis drop has a 2.5% chance of occurring, increasing by 1% per level of looting.\n\nIndividual items have the following chances of dropping: 1 \u2044 120 (about 0.83%) 7 \u2044 600 (about 1.17%) with Looting I 9 \u2044 600 (1.50%) with Looting II 11 \u2044 600 (about 1.83%) with Looting III Any picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping on death or when cured and drops with the same damage level it had when picked up.\n\nCarved Pumpkin [note 1] Jack o'Lantern  [Java Edition only ] [note 1] Iron Shovel Iron Sword Random Armor Zombie villagers have an 8.5% chance of dropping their naturally-spawned equipment (other than Halloween pumpkins), and drop it with a random durability.\n\nEach level of Looting increases the chance 1 percentage point (11.5% with Looting III).\n\n\u2191 a b Zombie villagers spawn with pumpkins and jack o'lanterns  [Java Edition only ] only during Halloween.\n\nAdult zombie villagers drop 5 and an additional 1\u20133 per naturally-spawned equipment.\n\nBaby zombie villagers drop 12 experience.\n\nMain article: Zombie \u00a7 Behavior Zombie villagers behave as ordinary zombies, except that they do not convert to drowned when submerged.\n\nIn Java Edition, zombie villagers that were converted from villagers retain their professions and clothes, which gain a tattered appearance.\n\nNaturally spawned zombie villagers (or ones spawned with spawn eggs) have a random profession that is not retained upon being cured; instead, they become unemployed and may gain a new profession if a job site block is nearby.\n\nZombie villagers can also spawn with the unemployed or Nitwit outfits.\n\nZombified nitwits remain nitwits after being cured.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, all zombie villagers have the same appearance, which looks like an unemployed zombie villager.\n\nNaturally spawned zombie villagers (or ones spawned with spawn eggs) have a random profession that is retained upon being cured.\n\nHowever, the profession is not locked and the cured villager may gain a new profession if in a village with an available job site block.\n\nZombie villagers can be unemployed, but they cannot be nitwits (zombified nitwit villagers become unemployed zombie villagers).\n\nBaby zombie villagers are always unemployed.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Curing a zombie villager Zombie villagers can be cured (converted to normal villagers) by first giving them the Weakness effect, which can be applied by: A splash potion of Weakness thrown by the player, a dispenser, or a witch.\n\nAn area effect cloud of Weakness from a creeper explosion [Java Edition only ], or a lingering potion.\n\nAn arrow of Weakness.\n\nThe / effect command, if cheats are enabled.\n\nThe weakened zombie villager must then be healed by using a (non-enchanted) golden apple on them.\n\nThe zombie villager begins to shudder to signal that curing is in progress.\n\nAlso, the Weakness effect is removed, replaced by Strength for the duration of the curing process.\n\nAn internal countdown timer is then started, counting down the total time to cure.\n\nTime to cure is initially 2000 ticks (nominally, 100 seconds or 1m 40s) in Bedrock Edition or a random integer between 3600 and 6000 ticks (180 to 300 seconds, 3\u20145 minutes) in Java Edition.\n\nOn each tick, there is a 1% chance for the game to look for cure accelerants.\n\nIt checks each block within a 9\u00d79\u00d79 cube centered on the villager for either an iron bar or a bed (either half: they're detected separately).\n\nFor each one found up to 14, there is a 30% chance of decreasing the countdown timer by 1 more tick.\n\nTherefore, having at least 14 half-beds and/or iron bars within range speeds up conversion by an average of 4.2%.\n\n[1] During the curing process the zombie villager behaves like a normal zombie except that it gains Strength (with a potency that doesn't depend on the difficulty level).\n\nThus, a zombie villager is more dangerous during curing than at other times.\n\nAt the end of the curing process, the zombie villager transforms into a villager and gains the Nausea effect for 10 seconds (which has no effect on the villager's behavior).\n\nIf it was holding any item it picked up, that item is dropped (unless it was enchanted with Curse of Binding, in which case it remains in the villager's inventory but is not worn and will not be dropped if the villager is killed).\n\nIf it was a baby before it was transformed into a zombie villager, it remains a baby after the cure.\n\nIf it had traded with a player at least once, it recovers its former profession and inventory of trades.\n\nOtherwise, it recovers its profession but might immediately change it if it finds and claims a workstation block for a different profession.\n\nA newly-cured villager, if it had a profession prior to being zombified, offers a trading discount to the player who administered the cure.\n\nThese discounts are permanent.\n\nIf a villager is cured more than once, the discounts get deeper until the price reaches the minimum of one emerald.\n\nVillagers near the cured villager are also affected but offer fewer, smaller discounts.\n\nZombie villagers that are in the process of converting do not despawn if the player moves far away from them, but like all monsters, they despawn if the difficulty is changed to Peaceful.\n\nIf a zombie villager spawned as a nitwit or was a nitwit before it was transformed into a zombie villager, it remains a nitwit if cured.\n\nCuring a villager spreads minor_positive gossip through the villager gossip system.\n\nA former nitwit zombie villager becomes an unemployed villager and can learn a profession after the cure.\n\nVillagers who were unemployed before transforming into a zombie villager might immediately claim a workstation to gain a profession.\n\nVillagers in a range of 16 blocks in a cube surrounding the cured villager also offer a small discount proportional to the number of cured villagers (up to 10).\n\nSaving and reloading the world causes the curing process to finish as soon as the chunk containing the villager is ticked.\n\nThis does not happen if the player moves out of range, then returns: In that case, the countdown timer pauses until the player returns.\n\nJava Edition: Zombie villagers use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b MC-226770 \u2191 MC-218122 Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock

[Java Edition only ] This is not dropped, even if killed with Looting.\n\nZombified piglins spawn in groups of 4 [JE only ] / 2-4 [BE only ] in the Nether at light level 11 and below on most blocks other than nether wart block.\n\nThey spawn most commonly in nether wastes, frequently in nether fortresses, uncommonly in crimson forests and are sometimes found riding striders in lava oceans.\n\nWhen a nether portal block in the Overworld receives a random tick, there is a chance of 1 \u2044 2000 (0.05%) on Easy, 1 \u2044 1000 (0.1%) on Normal and 3 \u2044 2000 (0.15%) on Hard for it to spawn a zombified piglin.\n\nIn Java Edition, they appear inside one of the portal blocks on the bottom.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, they spawn one block to the east or south of the portal (depending on which direction the portal is facing).\n\nNeither slabs nor lighting prevents this.\n\n\"Portal ticking\" can be used to increase the rate of zombified piglin spawning by repeatedly lighting and breaking a nether portal.\n\nZombified piglin spawning via this process is completely independent of the mob cap, similar to the spawning of phantoms in Java Edition, which means they can still spawn if there are a sufficient number of hostile mobs in the world.\n\nZombified piglins who spawn in this way cannot travel to the Nether for a preset amount of time, whether they walk through the portal they spawned in or through nearby portals. [Java Edition only ] A zombified piglin spawns when lightning strikes within 4 blocks of a pig.\n\nIf the pig is a piglet, it then transforms into a baby zombified piglin.\n\nA piglin or piglin brute that enters the Overworld or the End transforms into a zombified piglin after 15 seconds.\n\nWhen piglins wielding crossbows zombify, they keep their crossbows, but are unable to use them, and perform melee attack like other zombified piglins.\n\nWhen baby piglins zombify, they do not have weapons, unlike baby zombified piglins that naturally spawn.\n\nWhen piglin brutes zombify, they keep their axes.\n\nThe newly zombified piglin gets the Nausea effect for 10 seconds.\n\nThis is a purely visual effect, and does not affect the mob's behavior.\n\nA zombified piglin keeps any armor or weapons collected before being zombified [JE only ].\n\nBaby zombified piglins also have a 5% chance of becoming a chicken jockey [Java Edition only ].\n\nIf a piglin is in the middle of bartering and gets zombified while inspecting a gold ingot, it drops the ingot when it turns into a zombified piglin.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Zombified piglin farming 0\u20131 rotten flesh.\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-4 with Looting III.\n\n0\u20131 gold nugget s.\n\nThe maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-4 with Looting III.\n\n1 gold ingot (2.5% chance) if killed by a player or tamed wolf, or upon death when angry.\n\nThe chance is increased by 1% per level of Looting, for a maximum of 5.5% with Looting III.\n\nThere is an 8.5% [JE only ] or 25% [BE only ] chance to drop their original weapon if killed by a player or tamed wolf, or upon death when angry.\n\nThe chance is increased by 1% [JE only ] or 5% [BE only ] per level of Looting, for a maximum of 11.5% [JE only ] or 40% [BE only ] with Looting III.\n\nThe death animation does not include the weapon if it was dropped.\n\ngolden sword (sometimes enchanted) golden axe if zombified from a piglin brute crossbow if zombified from a piglin warped fungus on a stick if spawned riding a strider After a piglin transforms into a zombified piglin, it drops any acquired armor and held weapons upon death.\n\n5 for adults or 12 for babies if killed by a player or a tamed wolf, or dies while in an angered state [1].\n\nAn additional 1\u20133 is dropped if it does not drop its golden sword upon death.\n\nZombified piglins wander aimlessly about when idle.\n\nThey move at 2.28 m/s and are immune to fire and lava.\n\nWhen provoked, their speed increases to 3.38 m/s or faster for babies.\n\nIn Java Edition, like zombies, zombified piglins can attack wooden doors and may break them on Hard difficulty.\n\n[2] In Normal and Hard difficulties, up to 55% [JE only ] or 25% [BE only ] of zombified piglins pick up any armor pieces and swords better than their golden one, which they always drop when killed.\n\nThis also prevents them from despawning.\n\nZombified piglins may pick up an illager banner next to it [BE only ] as pillagers do.\n\n[3] Zombified piglins try to destroy any turtle eggs they see within 23 blocks away horizontally and 3 blocks away vertically (10 blocks horizontally and 2 blocks vertically in Bedrock Edition), not counting the block they are standing in.\n\nWhen a zombified piglin is first spawned, it always detects nearby turtle eggs after exactly 2 seconds, as long as there are two blocks of air above it.\n\nHowever, if the turtle egg is placed after the zombified piglin spawned, the zombified piglin takes some time to notice the turtle egg and try to break it.\n\nZombified piglins avoid walking near magma blocks and cannot jump over magma blocks one block high.\n\nIf a zombified piglin is surrounded by magma block wall one block height or higher, it gets near those surrounding magma blocks surrounding them.\n\nIf a zombified piglin spawns on or is pushed onto magma blocks, it pathfinds normally on the magma.\n\nZombified piglins do not retreat from zoglins, soul torches/lanterns, soul fire or soul campfires.\n\nZoglins attack zombified piglins on sight, causing a retaliation.\n\nZombified piglins are not distracted by gold, and cannot barter, unlike piglins.\n\nThey also do not follow players that are holding a gold ingot or another gold item.\n\nVillagers and wandering traders run away from zombified piglins, despite them being passive to villagers and wandering traders. [BE only ] In addition, piglins squeal in distress and flee from zombified piglins if they get too close.\n\nZombified piglins ignore piglins unless provoked, which can happen when a piglin with a crossbow shoots a zombified piglin by accident.\n\nZombified piglins will not become aggressive if a player attacks and/or kills a regular piglin.\n\nIron golems attack zombified piglins, which causes other zombified piglins to attack the iron golem.\n\nA zombified piglin is neutral to every mob that can attack, but they retaliate and gang up on any mob that provokes them.\n\nUndead, they are: Damaged by the status effect Instant Health and healed by the status effect Instant Damage.\n\nThrowing an instant damage splash potion does not anger them, since it heals them.\n\nUnaffected by the status effects Regeneration and Poison.\n\nIgnored by the wither and affected by Smite.\n\nUnable to swim in water, but do not drown.\n\nZombified piglins are not initially hostile, but all zombified piglins within a 67\u00d722\u00d767 to 111\u00d722\u00d7111 area [JE only ] or a 20-block radius [BE only ] centered on an attacked zombified piglin become aggressive and converge on the attacker (another mob or player, except goats and ghasts) if any individual is attacked, unless the zombified piglin attacked is killed in one hit.\n\n[4]  [JE only ] They make an aggressive sound when angered.\n\nIn addition, some zombified piglins have the ability to spawn reinforcements when attacked (similar to zombies and which can rarely include actual zombies). [JE only ] This applies to any hit registered as coming from the player or other mobs, whether its accidentally or purposefully, which includes deflected ghast fireballs, sweep attacks, snowballs and eggs, fireworks shot from crossbows, TNT, or a skeleton arrow.\n\nArrows shot from dispensers or bed explosions [5] don't provoke zombified piglins.\n\nDuration: A zombified piglin can remain hostile indefinitely if it is both within the follow range of the zombified piglin (33 to 55 blocks), and has a direct line of sight with the player.\n\nHowever, breaking one of those conditions causes a hostile zombified piglin to return neutral after a \"forgiveness timer\" expires.\n\nIn Java Edition, this timer ranges from 20 seconds to 55 seconds, whereas in Bedrock Edition it is always 25 seconds.\n\nThe forgiveness timer does not advance for zombified piglins in unloaded chunks.\n\nTherefore, if the player enters a nether portal and returns, any provoked zombified piglins in the area remain aggressive (unless another player was nearby to keep the chunks loaded).\n\nA player's death causes zombified piglins to become neutral toward the player if the gamerule forgiveDeadPlayers is true. [JE only ] A hostile zombified piglin can also \"sound an alarm\", spreading the aggro to all zombified piglins within a 67\u00d722\u00d767 to 111\u00d722\u00d7111 area  [JE only ] or 20-block [BE only ] radius.\n\nA hostile zombified piglin does this whenever the targeted player is within their follow range (33 to 55 blocks) and has a constant line-of-sight with its target, then it does the same every 4\u20136 seconds (80-120 game ticks), recruiting any formerly-neutral peers.\n\nThey pursue players even if they have the Invisibility effect.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a nearby neutral zombified piglin prevents a player from sleeping, as if it were a hostile mob.\n\nHostile zombified piglins have slightly different path finding than when they are neutral.\n\nFor example, they would fall off edges that would cause them fall damage in attempt to reach the attacker where most other mobs would otherwise not do.\n\nWhen a zombified piglin is angered, the normal piglins do not get aggressive, and vice versa.\n\nUnlike other zombie variants, zombified piglins do not attack villagers and wandering traders.\n\nIf caught in the Nether with few items or no gold armor, staying near zombified piglins is a good strategy in Java edition.\n\nAggravated piglins will be too afraid to approach the player, and any nearby skeletons shooting at the player will be quickly killed by the zombified piglins.\n\nThey do not become angry at the player if a mob hits them while trying to attack the player, though they have done so in versions of Pocket Edition.\n\nJava Edition: Zombified piglins use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b MC-226770 \u2191 \"[MC-218122] Unused sound event: minecraft:entity.zombie.attack_iron_door - Jira\" \u2013 Mojira, March 8, 2021.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Zombified piglins have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Additional fields for mobs that can become angry Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Tags common to all zombies Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Zombified Piglin\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe pre- Texture Update zombie pigman texture file has \"THX XAPHOBIA\" written on the unused section as a credit by Notch to the skin's original creator.\n\nDeaths of hostile zombified piglins always register as kills by the player they are targeting, regardless of whether that player ever touched that zombified piglin.\n\n[1]  [Java Edition only ] The zombified piglin's angry sound is played twice the speed of the original sound file in the game.

three of them generate in each one.\n\nThree elder guardians spawn naturally during the generation of each ocean monument: one in the top room of the monument and the other two in each wing section of the monument.\n\nThey do not respawn after their initial spawn, thus there are a limited number of them per world.\n\nHowever, they may be squished to death for some reasons, reducing the number available on the monument Elder guardians drop the following items: 0\u20132 prismarine shard s \u2013 always.\n\nAffected by Looting: 1 more drop per level, for a maximum of 5.\n\n1 wet sponge \u2013 when killed by the player.\n\nNot affected by Looting.\n\n20% chance to drop a tide armor trim smithing template, unaffected by Looting.\n\nOne of the following: 1 \u2044 2 chance: a raw cod (cooked cod if killed by fire [JE only ]).\n\nAffected by Looting: 0\u20131 more drops per level, for a maximum of 4.\n\n1 \u2044 3 chance: prismarine crystals.\n\nAffected by Looting: 0\u20131 more drops per level, for a maximum of 4.\n\n1 \u2044 6 chance: no drop.\n\n2.5% chance: a random fish.\n\nAffected by Looting: 1% more chance per level, for a maximum of 5.5% with Looting III.\n\nThis drop uses the same chances that fishing uses, resulting in a 60% chance for raw cod, a 25% chance for raw salmon, a 13% chance for pufferfish, and a 2% chance for tropical fish.\n\n10 \u2013 when killed by a player or tamed wolf.\n\nThis section would benefit from the addition of more images.\n\nPlease remove this notice once you've added suitable images to the article.\n\nThe specific instructions are: Animated images of the elder guardian cursing effect, distinct ones for java and bedrock due to animation differences Elder guardians do not swim around as much as normal guardians.\n\nElder guardians do not swim away when approached by a player it is targeting, unlike regular guardians.\n\nLike normal guardians, elder guardians attempt to attack both the player and squid.\n\nThe elder guardian's eye follows and stares at any nearby players, and always looks directly at its target.\n\nThe eye still follows a player under the effects of Invisibility or in Spectator mode, but doesn't attack.\n\nElder guardian are considered aquatic mobs, and thus are affected by the Impaling enchantment.\n\n [Java Edition only ]  [until JE Combat Tests ] The elder guardian has three methods of attacking, including firing its laser, inflicting Mining Fatigue, and a defensive thorn-like attack.\n\nThe elder guardian pathfinds toward an ocean monument if it is not within one.\n\nAn elder guardian attacks axolotls that are not playing dead.\n\nOtherwise, an elder guardian does not attack mobs (such as iron golems) that attack it, although the attacking mob takes damage from the elder guardian's natural spikes defense.\n\nLaser The laser takes several seconds to charge, doing no damage and allowing the player to move away in the meantime.\n\nAs it charges it turns from purple to bright yellow (thus acting as a warning indicator).\n\nOnce charged, the beam flashes green, abruptly ends, and deals 12 \u00d7 6 damage on Hard difficulty.\n\nThe elder guardian swims around for a few seconds before firing again.\n\nThe beam cannot be dodged and has a maximum range of approximately 14 blocks.\n\nOnce the player is out of range, if the beam is obstructed by solid blocks, or if the player has a shield, the guardian's beam disengages from the player and deals no damage.\n\n[more information needed ] In Java Edition, immediately after spawning and once each minute thereafter, the elder guardian searches for any player within a spherical radius of 50 blocks to afflict with Mining Fatigue III.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition the elder guardian inflicts any unafflicted player within range immediately.\n\nWhen afflicted, the player sees a ghostly image of the elder guardian and hears a ghostly noise.\n\nThe effect decreases a player's attack speed by 30% and decreases mining speed even more for 5 minutes.\n\nThe attack targets players through blocks, even underground, and a potion of Invisibility offers no defense.\n\nThis is not considered an attack in regards to the Thorns enchantment.\n\nThe image of the elder guardian is a particle effect that can be recreated by issuing the command / particle minecraft:elder_guardian. [Java Edition only ] An elder guardian deals 2 (3 on Hard mode) of damage every time it is hit while its spikes are extended, similar to the Thorns enchantment on armor.\n\nIf cornered by a player or axolotl, the elder guardian usually extends its spikes and fires at point-blank range.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition.\n\nThe elder guardian ghost flying.\n\nThe elder guardian ghost is an unused mob added in beta 1.13.0.4.\n\nIts file isn't included in the behavior pack, and it can be spawned only by using the command / summon elder_guardian_ghost ~ ~ ~.\n\nThe elder guardian ghost has defensive spikes.\n\nThe elder guardian ghost has the same model and texture as the elder guardian, but uses the player hurt sound, has less health, and is missing the back tail model.\n\nWhen spawned outside of water, it floats upward until it despawns, similar to a mob tied to a balloon, or under a high level of levitation effect, but it passes through blocks.\n\nThe elder guardian ghost itself isn't immune to suffocation damage, and drops only experience.\n\nIt behaves similar to custom mobs added in behavior packs with broken AI; the mobs float upward and pass through blocks when hit.\n\nIf an elder guardian ghost is spawned underwater, it slowly sinks downward, passing through all blocks (including bedrock), until it eventually it falls into the void and dies.\n\nWhen underwater, the elder guardian ghost can rotate its body, look at players, and swim while slowly sinking downward.\n\nJava Edition: Elder guardians use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 Increases quadratically from minimum to maximum as the attack goes on \u2191 Increases linearly from minimum to maximum as the attack goes on Bedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Elder guardians have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nIssues relating to \"Elder Guardian\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe elder guardian's eye is the \"head\" part of the mob 's model, giving the illusion of a dynamic eye.\n\nThe elder guardian texture has the name \"jeb\" on it.\n\nAccording to Jeb, elder guardians were introduced to encourage players to solve the temple maze rather than dig through it easily.\n\nHe acknowledges there are ways around it, but players still have to solve the challenge in a different way.\n\n[4] Also according to Jeb, the \"jump scare\" by an elder guardian is unintentional, instead, he added it to provide a visual cue as to why players get slowed down by Mining Fatigue.\n\n[4] In Java Edition 3D Shareware v1.34, elder guardians drop blue keys.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, elder guardians make their underwater death sounds if killed on land.\n\nThey also, like guardians, don't make flopping sounds on Bedrock Edition.\n\nThe elder guardian was once referred to as a \u201cboss\u201d by Mojang.\n\nThis means depending on how you see it, it could be the third boss as well as the two official bosses.\n\nA special effect of the elder guardian, which gives Mining Fatigue III for 5 minutes.\n\nThe elder guardian's Mining Fatigue effect.\n\nAn elder guardian spawned inside an ocean monument.\n\nAn elder guardian spreading its spikes.\n\nAn elder guardian's laser.\n\nAn elder guardian in full view.\n\nThe inside of an elder guardian (spikes retracted).\n\nSize comparison between an elder and a normal guardian.\n\nThe elder guardian curse ghastly image shows the elder guardian's full model.\n\nA group of axolotls attacking an elder guardian.\n\nA player avoiding an elder guardian by using the Invisibility effect.\n\nA player avoiding an elder guardian by using the Invisibility effect.\n\nAn elder guardian in promotional artwork for the Boss Update.\n\nMinecraft Mobestiary 's page about elder guardians.\n\nLego Minecraft elder guardian.\n\nNarrator and MARILLA attempting to battle an Elder Guardian.\n\n\u2191 MC-57057 \u2014 Guardian laser attack sound ignores distance \u2191 MC-92294 \u2191 http://www.mojang.com/2016/08/sneak-peek-boss-update-is-coming-to-pocket-and-windows-10/ [dead link ] \u2191 a b https://minecraft.net/en-us/article/block-week-prismarine Meet the Elder Guardian \u2013 Minecraft.net on November 6, 2017 Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

    "content": "For the powerful mob in Minecraft Dungeons, see MCD:Illusioner.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Java Edition.\n\nIllusioner Illusioner Casting Aiming Health 32 \u00d7 16 Classification Illager hostile mob Behavior Hostile Damage Easy and normal: 2 \u2013 5 Hard: 3 \u2013 5 The illusioner is an unused illager armed with a bow.\n\nIt attacks using illusions and can also fire arrows.\n\nAn illusioner has no spawn egg in the Creative mode inventory.\n\nAn illusioner can be spawned only using data packs or the / summon illusioner in-game command.\n\nIllusioners do not spawn in woodland mansions or pillager outposts, nor at raids or patrols.\n\nSimilarly to the other unused giant and zombie horse mobs, illusioners do not spawn in any biome, monster spawner or world -generated structure.\n\nWhen an illusioner is killed by a player or a tamed wolf, any naturally spawned equipment, including its unenchanted bow, has an 8.5% chance of dropping (or 9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) and drops with a random item durability.\n\nIn addition, 5 experience orbs are dropped on player or tamed wolf kills.\n\nAn invisible illusioner captain and its four copies strafing.\n\nThe real banner is invisible.\n\nThe illusioner also drops one illager ominous banner if it is a raid captain.\n\nAlthough they do not naturally spawn in raids, illusioners spawned by the player attack players, adult villagers, iron golems and wandering traders within a 16*4*16 cubic area.\n\nAn illusioner joins a nearby raid if it occurs or joins a patrol if sufficiently near a patrol captain.\n\nThe illusioner attacks with its spells and its bow, firing an arrow every second.\n\nUnless the illusioner is summoned using commands, it cannot attack with a non-bow item in its hand, cannot use tipped arrows in its offhand slot (but can use spectral arrows) and cannot use enchanted bows.\n\nAlso, it is the only illager that can see its target through walls.\n\nThe Illusioner moves quickly on a semi-circular fashion and always tries to maintain a consistent distance between itself and the player, strafing from left to right and vice-versa, retreating if the player gets too close or advancing if the player retreats.\n\nFinally, the illusioner has two spells: a spell that blinds its opponent and a spell that summons visual pseudo-duplicates and makes the illusioner invisible.\n\nThe illusioner casts its blindness spell only if the regional difficulty is greater than 2.\n\nAs result, the world difficulty setting, the inhabited time of a chunk, the total daytime in the world and the phase of the moon from the day-night cycle affects its ability.\n\nAn illusioner's four false duplicates.\n\nThe real illusioner is invisible.\n\nAn illusioner casts a Blindness effect that lasts for 20 seconds upon first engaging a new player opponent.\n\nIt signals this attack by raising its arms during a short-timed animation, making a low pitched sound and producing a black mist of particles ().\n\nOther entities (typically a wolf, a snow golem or an iron golem) do not trigger this magic.\n\nThe illusioner does not cast this spell more than once on the same player opponent, unless it has first shifted its attention to another opponent and then back to that original opponent.\n\nThis spell resets the illusioner's spell cooldown to 1 second and resets the cooldown for the blinding spell to 9 seconds.\n\nAs long as an illusioner is engaged in combat, it casts an Invisibility status effect on itself that lasts 60 seconds and refreshes the effect whenever the Invisibility's time runs out.\n\nThe illusioner signals this spell by raising its arms, making a strange high pitched sound and producing a blue mist of particles called \"mirror\" ().\n\nWhen an illusioner becomes invisible through this or another method, it creates four false duplicates of itself.\n\nThese hover and waver at short distances from the actually invisible illusioner, though they do not space themselves out until the first time the illusioner is attacked.\n\nThey face in exactly the same direction as the illusioner and move somewhat in step with the original, appearing to no-clip through blocks like a vex does.\n\nDespite using the shooting animation whenever the original uses its bow, only the real illusioner can shoot and be damaged.\n\nThe clones move to new positions if they were not triggered and are still bunched together.\n\nThe Illusioner can also do this once in a while to \"refresh\" the clones' positions.\n\nWhen the real illusioner is damaged, its duplicates all snap back to where the real illusioner is, then quickly snap back out to new positions, making a teleporting sound, signaling the hit.\n\nIf an invisible illusioner receives the Glowing effect, all of the duplicates glow, while the true illusioner remains invisible.\n\nMoreover, only the invisible illusioner burns when catching fire.\n\nThe duplicates dissipate once the illusioner's Invisibility effect ends.\n\nThis spell resets the illusioner's spell cooldown to 1 second and resets the cooldown for the invisibility spell to 17 seconds.\n\nIllusioners use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\n\u2191 a b c MC-98316 See also: Entity format Illusioners have entity data associated with them

illusioner Issues relating to \"Illusioner\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe illusioner displace sound is almost the same as the traditional teleport sound displaced by teleportation via an ender pearl or chorus fruit, endermen or shulkers, albeit with a slight distortion at the end.\n\nIllusioners shoot backward when they are in a boat.\n\n[2] Illusioners hold bows in a different direction compared to skeletons or players, a little more diagonally.\n\nThe illusioner's second death sound is the same as the evoker's second death sound.\n\nIn a video titled ' Easter Eggs behind the...\n\nSick villagers???\n\n' that was recently posted on the official Minecraft YouTube channel, not only do they mention the Illusioner, but Jens also says 'You will definitely be seeing more of them in the future', which indicates that the Illusioner may be officially be implemented into the game in the near future.\n\n[3] Illusioner illusions duplicates dying when the

each use reduces 10% of the remaining time to grow up.\n\nDespite their hostile nature, killer bunnies can breed with other rabbits and with each other, having the unusual chance of creating a baby killer bunny.\n\nA Toast rabbit does not produce a Toast rabbit baby, however.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, baby rabbits follow their parents; this behavior is absent in Java Edition.\n\n[2] The six natural types of rabbits.\n\nRabbits typically spawn using one of six different skins.\n\nSkins include regular brown fur, white fur with red eyes (albino), black mottled fur, black and white spotted fur, gold (cream) fur, and salt and pepper fur.\n\nThe biome determines the skin used: Rabbits in snowy biomes have 80% white fur and 20% black and white fur.\n\nRabbits in deserts have 100% gold fur.\n\nRabbits in other biomes have 50% brown fur, 40% salt & pepper fur, and 10% black fur.\n\nRabbits with specific skins can be spawned using / summon rabbit ~ ~ ~ {RabbitType: (Number from 0 - 5)}  [Java Edition only ] or / summon rabbit ~ ~ ~ in_desert (gold)/in_snow (white)  [Bedrock Edition only ].\n\nWhile it is possible to go above 5, this results in rabbits with skins identical to RabbitType: 0, with the exception of RabbitType: 99, the Killer Bunny.\n\nThere are two special variants of rabbits: This feature is exclusive to Java Edition.\n\nThe current killer bunny texture The killer bunny is an aggressive variant of the rabbit exclusive to Java Edition that is hostile toward players, foxes, and wolves.\n\nIts fur is pure white with blood-red eyes that are horizontal, compared to a normal rabbit's vertical eyes.\n\nIt can be spawned only by using the / summon rabbit ~ ~ ~ {RabbitType:99} command.\n\nIt appears with a nameplate over its head reading \"The Killer Bunny\".\n\nIf the killer bunny finds any player within a 16-block radius, it hops toward the player much faster than a normal rabbit.\n\nIt moves in a style similar to that of a spider.\n\nOnce it closes in, it jumps at the player, dealing 8 damage on Normal difficulty.\n\nIf the player strikes at the killer bunny, it runs away for a brief moment, then returns to lunging at the player.\n\nKiller bunnies are immune to the Thorns enchantment.\n\nIf it cannot find a player, the killer bunny actively seeks out and attacks any foxes or wolves, including tamed wolves.\n\nThese mobs, in return, attack the killer bunny, leading to a vicious fight.\n\nOn peaceful difficulty, the killer bunny does not despawn, despite its hostile nature.\n\nIt still attacks wolves and tamed wolves, but not the player.\n\nThe killer bunny can be bred and leashed and follows players holding carrots, despite its hostile nature.\n\n\"Toast\" redirects here.\n\nFor messages displayed on-screen, see Toasts, Advancements, Recipes, or Tutorial hints.\n\nFor Bread, see Bread.\n\nThe rabbit named \"Toast\" Naming a rabbit Toast (using either a name tag or a renamed spawn egg) re-textures it to have the appearance of a black Dutch, with a large black and white patch and more black fur around the face than the natural black and white spotted rabbit.\n\nOther than its name and skin, Toast behaves exactly like it would if it were unnamed.\n\nWhen Toast rabbits are bred, whether with each other or with regular rabbits, their offspring do not have the Toast pattern; they have a pattern consistent with the parents' original coloring prior to renaming.\n\nIf the player renames a killer bunny to Toast, it still attacks players and wolves.\n\nLike the killer bunny, Toast does not spawn naturally.\n\nThis rabbit is the skin of user xyzen420's girlfriend's missing rabbit, which Ryan Holtz implemented as a memorial.\n\n[3] Java Edition: Regular rabbits use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nKiller bunnies use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: Rabbits have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nJava Edition: Main article: Entity format Entity data Additional fields for mobs that can breed Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs MoreCarrotTicks: Set to 40 when a carrot crop is eaten, decreases by 0\u20132 every tick until it reaches 0.\n\nHas no effect in game.\n\nRabbitType: Determines the skin of the rabbit.\n\nAlso determines if rabbit should be hostile.\n\nMain article: Rabbit/DV [edit ] Bedrock Edition: See Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nNote: this video is outdated as rabbits can no longer be tamed, rabbits are smaller now, and the killer rabbit is now called the killer bunny.\n\nIssues relating to \"Rabbit\" are maintained on the bug tracker.\n\nReport issues there.\n\nThe Killer Bunny is a reference to the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog from the British comedy film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which it was formerly named.\n\nThe Killer Bunny was suggested by X user @88bully.\n\n[7] The death sound for the rabbit is called bunnymurder.ogg.\n\nA brown rabbit running.\n\nRyan Holtz modeling the rabbit.\n\nThe first image of a rabbit tweeted by Ryan Holtz.\n\nThe second image of a rabbit tweeted by Ryan Holtz.\n\nThe third image of a rabbit tweeted by Ryan Holtz.\n\nThe fourth image of a rabbit tweeted by Ryan Holtz.\n\nThe fifth image of a rabbit tweeted by Ryan Holtz.\n\nBaby rabbits.\n\nFirst image of Toast.\n\nSecond image of Toast.\n\nThird image of Toast.\n\nFourth image of Toast.\n\nThe first image of the Killer Bunny.\n\nThe second image of the Killer Bunny.\n\nA pen of rabbits.\n\nThe second Killer Bunny texture, similar to a normal white rabbit.\n\nAll of the available rabbit skins.\n\nThe Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog as a baby.\n\nThe third Killer Bunny texture, with blood on its mouth and paws.\n\nKiller bunny.\n\nA rabbit eating a carrot.\n\nLego Minecraft Black Rabbit.\n\nLego Minecraft Baby Brown Rabbit.\n\nA rabbit in official artwork for The Wild Update.\n\nRabbit art.\n\nJumbo Rabbit from Minecraft Earth.\n\nA rabbit preparing to shoot Steve with a crossbow.\n\n[8] The White Rabbit texture in Bedrock Edition 1.9.\n\n\u2191 MC-207993 \u2191 MC-158608 \u2014 resolved as \"Works As Intended\".\n\n\u2191 \"@xyZenTV The skin only appears when you name the rabbit Toast using a name tag, it isn't in the random pool:\" \u2013 @TheMogMiner (Ryan Holtz) on X, July 1, 2014 \u2191 https://minecraft.net/article/who-framed-killer-rabbit \u2191 \"FYI, I asked Josh to remove this feature again.\n\nAlthough funny, being scared of rabbits doesn't fit with the Beast's lore.\" \u2013 @jeb_ (Jens Bergensten) on X, October 30, 2018 \u2191 MC-96449 \u2014 resolved as \"Fixed\".\n\n\u2191 \"@88bully @xyZenTV You, I like you.\n\nI like the way you think.\n\nHowever, no promises.\n\nPromises are made to be broken.\" \u2013 @TheMogMiner (Ryan Holtz) on X, June 6, 2014 \u2191 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-85xXgFHlE Entities View at: Template:Entities/content [edit ]",

    "content": "This page describes content that exists only in outdated versions of Minecraft.\n\nThis feature used to be in the game, but has ever since been removed.It may or may not return in a future update.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to New Nintendo 3DS Edition and Legacy Console Edition.\n\nGeneric villager Farmer Librarian Priest Blacksmith Butcher Nitwit Baby Farmer Baby Librarian Baby Priest Baby Blacksmith Baby Butcher Baby Nitwit Health 20 \u00d7 10 Behavior Passive Spawn see \u00a7Spawning Details Size Adult: Height: 1.95 Blocks Width: 0.6 Blocks Baby: Height: 0.975 Blocks Width: 0.3 Blocks Generic villagers were passive mobs that inhabit villages, with different professions, breed, and interact.\n\nTheir clothing varied according to their occupation.\n\nA player could trade with villagers, using emeralds as currency.\n\nThey were replaced with a revamped version of themselves in the Village & Pillage update.\n\nIn Java Edition, old villagers can only spawn in versions of Minecraft prior to 1.14.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, old villagers can only spawn if they existed from a template world prior to 1.11.0, and any old villager spawned after 1.11.0 outside a template world will be converted into villager_v2.\n\nVillagers will breed autonomously, but need doors and need to be willing in order to spawn baby villagers.\n\nAfter exactly 20 minutes during which the baby villager is within render distance, the baby villager will grow up to an adult.\n\nSee this section for more information.\n\nVillagers will spawn if a player uses a splash potion of weakness on a v1 zombie villager in template world and then feeds it a regular golden apple.\n\nIt will then shake and turn into a villager within 0-5 minutes.\n\nDuring the change, the zombie villager can still burn in the sun.\n\nVillagers drop nothing upon death.\n\nTrade: 3\u20136 xp Trade while willing: 8\u201311 xp Upon spawning, villagers will leave their homes and begin to explore the village.\n\nGenerally, they wander aimlessly inside the village during the day.\n\nThey may go indoors or outdoors, and they periodically make mumbling sounds.\n\nOccasionally, two villagers may stop and turn to look at each other, in a behavior called socializing, in which they will stare at another villager for 4-5 seconds at a time.\n\nIn the case of players, they will continuously stare at them as long as the player is close enough, unless the villager tries to get into a house at night, farm food, or flee from a zombie.\n\nIn Legacy Console Edition, when a player attacks a villager, the villager will not run away, but anger particles will fly out from the villager if it is in a village.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, villagers do not stop continuously in front of players.\n\nThey will also sprint away if the player attacks them.\n\nVillagers, like other mobs, will find paths around obstructions, avoiding walking off cliffs and some blocks that cause harm.\n\nHowever, in crowded situations it is possible for one villager to push another off a cliff or into harm.\n\nVillagers also occasionally walk off of ledges high enough to cause fall damage.\n\nAt night or during rain, villagers will run inside, closing doors behind them, and staying indoors until morning.\n\nIn the morning they will head outside and resume normal behavior.\n\nVillagers will run away from zombies, illagers and vexes within 8 blocks.\n\nIf a villager finds itself outside the village boundary, or a villager without a village detects a village boundary within 32 blocks, it will move quickly back within the boundary.\n\nA villager taken more than 32 blocks away from its village boundary will forget the village within about 6 seconds.\n\nWhether in a village or not, a villager is never prone to despawning.\n\nVillagers cannot open trapdoors, fence gates, or iron doors.\n\nThere is evidence that villagers are prone to overcrowding certain areas of a village while leaving other areas completely empty.\n\nWhen moving inside, the AI prefers doors within 16 blocks (Euclidean distance).\n\nIt also tends to prefer doors with fewer villagers nearby, however \"nearby\" in this case is only 1.5 blocks and, when moving inside, villagers prefer to move 2.5 blocks inside when the inside is to the south or east and therefore will be out of range of this check.\n\nDuring the day, it has been observed that villagers will tend to cluster near a trapped villager or any existing large cluster of villagers, likely due to the \"socialize\" AI routine overriding their inclination to wander.\n\nVillagers have eight hidden inventory slots, which start empty whenever the villager is spawned.\n\nVillagers will not intentionally seek out items to pick up, but they will collect any bread, carrots, potatoes, wheat, seeds, beetroot and beetroot seeds they happen to come within range of.\n\nThese are the only items they are able to pick up, though the player may use the / replaceitem command to put an arbitrary item into a villager's inventory.\n\nIf a player and a villager are in the pickup range of an item at the same time, the player will always pick it up first.\n\nEven when gamerule keepInventory is set to false, villagers that are killed with any of the available items above will not drop them once they are killed.\n\nAny items in these slots are lost if a villager becomes a zombie villager; a zombie villager has no inventory slots.\n\nIf / gamerule mobGriefing is false, villagers will not pick up items.\n\nA dispenser can be used, if adjacent to a villager, to place armor on it.\n\nWhile not visible in most cases (other than pumpkins and mob heads) the equipment will be fully functional; for example, the Thorns enchantment will hurt zombies that attack a villager with a piece of armor enchanted with the Thorns enchantment equipped.\n\nIf a villager has enough food in one inventory stack (6 bread or 24 carrots, potatoes, beetroots, or 18 wheat for farmers only) and sees a villager without enough food in one inventory stack (3 bread or 12 carrots, potatoes or beetroot for non-farmers; 15 bread, 60 carrots, potatoes, or beetroot, or 45 wheat for Farmers), the villager may decide to share food with that villager.\n\nTo share, a villager finds his first inventory stack with at least 4 bread, carrots, potatoes, or beetroot or with at least 6 wheat, and then throws half the stack (rounded down) in the direction of the target villager.\n\nWhen wheat is shared, it is first crafted to bread which may result in 1 or 2 less than half the stack being shared.\n\nAdult and baby brown-robed villagers, both farmers and other careers, will tend crops within the village boundary.\n\nVillagers far enough outside the boundary of any village will also tend nearby crops.\n\nFarmland to be tended is found by seeking for certain blocks up to 15 blocks away from the villager in X and Z and up to 1 away in Y (a 31\u00d731\u00d73 area total).\n\nIf a brown-robed villager does not have enough food in one stack in its inventory (15 bread, 60 carrots, potatoes, or beetroot, or 45 wheat) and finds fully-grown wheat, carrots, potatoes or beetroot, it will move to the crop block and break it.\n\nIf a brown-robed villager has any seeds, carrots, potatoes, or beetroot seeds in its inventory and finds an air block above farmland, it will move to it and plant a crop.\n\nThey will always plant from the first eligible slot in their inventory.\n\nIf / gamerule mobGriefing is false, villagers will not be able to farm.\n\nA group of baby villagers playing a game of tag.\n\nBaby villagers will sprint around, entering and leaving houses at will.\n\nThey will sometimes stop sprinting to stare at an iron golem.\n\nIf the iron golem is holding a poppy, it might attract any baby villagers near it.\n\nBaby villagers in Bedrock / Legacy Console Editions have a slightly bigger head than in the Java Edition, this also can be seen in different baby mobs in the game as well.\n\nUnlike other breed-able mobs, the parents and child have no personal interactions other than socializing.\n\nMain articles: Siege and Zombie Zombies will try to find and attack villagers within a 42 block radius (even when the villager is invisible), and will attempt to break down doors.\n\nZombies will only successfully break doors if the difficulty is set to hard, though only a fraction of zombies spawned in hard mode have the capacity to break doors.\n\nThis also applies to zombie pigmen if they path find through a door.\n\nVillagers will run away from zombies, sometimes hiding in houses.\n\nThe villager's only \"natural\" defense are the iron golems, which attack nearby hostile mobs.\n\nZombies will try to kill villagers, or convert them to v1 zombie villagers.\n\nThe chance that the villager will become a zombie villager on death is 0% on Easy, 50% on Normal, and 100% on Hard.\n\nBaby villagers can be infected by zombies as well.\n\nVillagers will also run from zombie pigmen, though the latter will not attack them.\n\nDrowned will chase and attack villagers in the same way zombies will, and villagers will run from drowned in the same way they run from zombies.\n\nDrowned can also convert villagers to zombie villagers, even when attacking from a distance with a trident.\n\nWhen lightning strikes within 3\u20134 blocks of a villager, it will turn into a witch.\n\nSee also: Tutorials/Legacy Console village mechanics Two villagers mating.\n\nVillagers will mate depending on the number of valid doors.\n\nIf \"willing\" (see below), villagers will mate as long as the population is less than 35% (Bedrock Edition: 100%) of valid doors, rounded down.\n\nThe type of villager that spawns is independent of the villager's parents.\n\nA valid door is any door within the village radius where the number of \"outside\" spaces within 5 blocks in a straight line on one side of the door is not the same as the number of \"outside\" spaces within 5 blocks on the other side of the door.\n\nA space is considered to be \"outside\" if it has nothing but transparent blocks above it all the way to the sky.\n\nA census is periodically taken to determine the current population of the village.\n\nAll villagers within the horizontal boundary of the village and within 5 vertical blocks (Bedrock Edition: no apparent height limit) of the center will be counted as part of the population to determine if continued villager mating is allowed.\n\nHowever, any villager within the horizontal boundary of the village and within the spherical boundary of the village will attempt to enter mating mode as long as there is at least one villager within the boundary.\n\nIf two villagers simultaneously enter mating mode while they are close to one another, they will mate with each other and produce a child.\n\nAdditionally, villagers must be \"willing\" in order to breed.\n\nAfter mating, they will no longer be willing, and must be made willing again.\n\nVillagers can become willing by having either 3 bread, 12 carrots, 12 potatoes, or 12 beetroots in one stack in their inventory.\n\nAny villager with an excess of food (usually farmers) will throw food to other villagers, allowing them to pick it up and obtain enough food to become willing.\n\nThe player can also throw bread, carrots, beetroots, or potatoes at the villagers themselves to encourage breeding.\n\nVillagers will consume the required food upon becoming willing.\n\nVillagers may also become willing when the player trades with them.\n\nWillingness is granted the first time a new offer is traded, or at a one-in-five chance on subsequent trades.\n\nMost of the time, villagers becomes willing after the second or third trade.\n\nGreen particles will appear if the villager becomes willing by trading.\n\nThis will not cause them to immediately seek out a mate, however.\n\nBefore Java Edition 1.8, willingness was not implemented.\n\nThe only factor needed is enough valid doors.\n\nEach villager has a profession, which can be identified by their clothing.\n\nVillagers also have careers specific to their profession.\n\nThe player can identify a villager's career by reading the title at the top of the trading interface.\n\nBelow is a table listing the various villagers, with their careers in relation to their professions, as well as the IDs specifying these.\n\nWhile each profession has a 1 in 6 chance (16.67%) of occurring, the probabilities for individual careers to occur are more diversified.\n\nThey are listed in the table as well.\n\nWhen a villager is transformed into a zombie villager, the profession of the zombie villager will remain unchanged.\n\nHowever, the career will be reset and randomly picked again if the zombie villager is cured, allowing for the player to get a villager with a new career and new trade offers.\n\nOld trade offers will disappear, even if the same career is chosen again.\n\n\u201c It started because players could summon villagers without a career by using commands: it was the only way to get villagers with green robes.\n\nWhenever we discover we have a bug which is used by the community we just see it as 'undefined behaviour' - and 'fix' it by making it a feature.\n\nIn this case we just needed a profession for the green-robed villager.\n\nI don't remember what name we came up with first - I think it was 'unemployed' or something, but it doesn't really fit in the world, because I don't really think the other villagers are employed by anyone either.\n\nSo I think the next suggestion was 'village idiot' but I thought 'nitwit' was a more fun name.\n\n\u201e \u2014 Jeb about the Nitwit [1] The nitwit villager is a villager that wears a green robe and cannot be traded with.\n\nMain article: Trading/Before Village and Pillage The pre-1.14 trading interface displaying a trade of 35 paper for 1 emerald.\n\n\u201c Right click on a villager and you can trade with them, offering them emeralds in exchange for better equipment, maps to notable treasures or food.\n\nUnless you are trying to trade with a nitwit, of course, in which case you're going to get squat.\n\nWho's the nitwit now?\n\n\u201e \u2014 Marsh Davies [2] The trading system is a gameplay mechanic that allows players to trade emeralds for items and vice-versa with villagers.\n\nTheir trades can be good or bad, depending on what the cost is and what items you might get.\n\nTrading is only available for adult villagers; the player cannot trade with baby villagers or the nitwit villager.\n\nRight-clicking a villager will allow a player to trade with them, and display their career.\n\nVillagers will make offers based on their profession and career, and will only make trades based on whatever offers they are making.\n\nDifferent offers may be viewed by pressing the left and right buttons next to the currently displayed offer.\n\nAll offers involve emerald as a currency, and some item pertinent to the villager's profession and career.\n\nTrading allows the acquisition of rare items that would otherwise be fairly difficult to obtain, such as chain armor.\n\nThe trading mechanic allows players to get bottle o' enchanting in survival mode.\n\nWhen villagers get a new trade, pink particles and green cross particles appear.\n\nAfter trading a new offer once, the villager will allow a new tier of offers.\n\nAfter 2-12 times an offer is repeated, the villager will lock the trade offer.\n\nThat is, the villager will no longer offer this trade.\n\nWhen this happens, the player will have to use another new trade offer in the villager's window once (or several times if it is already used once), and then wait for a short time.\n\nIf green particles appear, all trades unlock.\n\nThat is, the villager will start offering all trades.\n\nThere is a maximum number of tiers each villager can possess, varying by career.\n\nOnce the villager has unlocked all tiers, it will not open any new ones.\n\nHowever, players will still be able to renew all offers by trading.\n\nWhen a villager gives off particles from a new trade, they get 10 seconds of Regeneration I, which gives them 4.\n\nCommands or external editors can help villagers get new trades.\n\nIf a villager unintentionally picks up certain seeds or crops, it will throw it to another villager to simulate trading between the villagers.\n\nJava Edition: Villagers used the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: \u2191 MCPE-113788 Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: See also: Chunk format Villagers have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\n\nEntity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all mobs Additional fields for mobs that can breed Profession: The ID of the texture used for this villager.\n\nThis also influences trading options.\n\nRiches: Currently unused.\n\nIncreases by the number of emeralds traded to a villager any time they are traded.\n\nCareer: The ID of this villager's career.\n\nThis also influences trading options and the villager's name in the GUI (if it does not have a CustomName).\n\nIf 0, the next time offers are refreshed, the game will assign a new Career and reset CareerLevel to 1.\n\nCareerLevel: The current level of this villager's trading options.\n\nInfluences the trading options generated by the villager; if it is greater than their career's maximum level, no new offers are generated.\n\nIncrements when a trade causes offers to be refreshed.\n\nIf 0, the next trade to do this will assign a new Career and set CareerLevel to 1.\n\nSet to a high enough level and there will be no new trades to release (Career must be set to 1 or above).\n\nWilling: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the villager is willing to mate.\n\nBecomes true after certain trades (those which would cause offers to be refreshed), and false after mating.\n\nInventory: Each compound tag in this list is an item in the villager's inventory, up to a maximum of 8 slots.\n\nItems in two or more slots that can be stacked together will automatically be condensed into one slot.\n\nIf there are more than 8 slots, the last slot will be removed until the total is 8.\n\nIf there are 9 slots but two previous slots can be condensed, the last slot will be present after the two other slots are combined.\n\nAn item in the inventory, excluding the Slot tag.\n\nTags common to all items Offers: Is generated when the trading menu is opened for the first time.\n\nRecipes: List of trade options.\n\nA trade option.\n\nrewardExp: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if this trade will provide XP orb drops.\n\nAll trades from naturally-generated villagers in Java Edition reward XP orbs.\n\nmaxUses: The maximum number of times this trade can be used before it is disabled.\n\nIncreases by a random amount from 2 to 12 when offers are refreshed.\n\nuses: The number of times this trade has been used.\n\nThe trade becomes disabled when this is greater or equal to maxUses.\n\nbuy: The first 'cost' item, without the Slot tag.\n\nTags common to all items buyB: May not exist.\n\nThe second 'cost' item, without the Slot tag.\n\nTags common to all items sell: The item being sold for each set of cost items, without the Slot tag.\n\nTags common to all items The villagers were inspired by the shop keepers in Dungeon Master 2.\n\n[3] Originally, the mobs populating villages were to be pigmen.\n\n[4] Villagers tend to often cram into houses that are in the southern-eastern area of their village.\n\nName tags used on villagers will always name the villager instead of opening the trading interface.\n\nVillagers can see invisible players.\n\nAfter a zombie villager is cured, the villager gets Nausea for 10 seconds (indicated by the purple status effect particles).\n\nWhen a villager is in love mode, it walks very slowly.\n\nHowever, when a villager runs indoors as the night falls, it runs extremely fast, even faster than the player's sprinting speed.\n\nThe 1.6 release poster showed a blue-robed villager in the background.\n\nSuch a villager has never been seen in-game.\n\nThe Priest, Librarian and Nitwit villagers have an unused hood in their textures.\n\nOriginally, villagers used rubies as their currency, but they were later replaced with emeralds.\n\nMain article: Easter eggs \u00a7 2014 On April 1, 2014, Mojang announced that villagers have taken over the skin servers and content delivery networks (CDN) as an April Fools joke.\n\nThis caused players' current skin to turn into villager skins.\n\nThis also caused users to be unable to change their skins.\n\nDifferent career villager skins were used, including the then-unused nitwit villager (green robe).\n\nMany of the sounds were also changed, supposedly by the villagers.\n\nThey seem to be similar to a villager talking (with words, rather than their normal sounds).\n\nThe in-game music has also been altered to include villager like noises, and also features a villager version of the \"Game of Thrones\" theme on the title screen.\n\nThe sounds originate from the sound resource pack created by Element Animation, titled The Element Animation Villager Sound Resource Pack (T.E.A.V.S.R.P), which is based on the villagers appearing in their fan videos.\n\nThe villagers were voiced by Dan Lloyd, Director of Element Animation.\n\nVillager in Beta 1.9-pre1, when villagers had the word \"TESTIFICATE\" displayed over their heads.\n\nA group of villager children socializing together.\n\nThe 13w22a Banner.\n\nA house full of villagers.\n\nA villager looking at the player, who is invisible, thus proving that
