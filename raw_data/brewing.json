    "content": "This article needs to be updated.\n\nPlease update this page to reflect recent updates or newly available information.\n\nReason: Some information in this article is out of date; for example in Bedrock Edition, extended regeneration lasts a full 2 minutes.\n\nSee discussion at Talk:Brewing#Likely errors in Brewing chart.\n\nPotion brewing chart (most efficient recipes, excludes splash and lingering potions).\n\nRecipes may differ in Bedrock Edition.\n\nBrewing is the process of creating potions, splash potions, and lingering potions by adding various ingredients to water bottles in a brewing stand.\n\nBase ingredients are ingredients that can be added directly to a water bottle and are the starting point of all potions.\n\nNether wart is the most fundamental of the base ingredients, as it is required to make the vast majority of potions.\n\nModifiers are ingredients used to alter the properties of a potion or to change a potion effect into a different one.\n\nThe fermented spider eye is unique in that it is the only modifier that can convert a water bottle directly into an effective potion.\n\nEnhancement: Generally, upgrading a potion involves a trade-off between duration and potency.\n\nA potion with an enhanced effect has shorter duration, and a potion with extended duration cannot have an enhanced effect.\n\nHowever: Upgrading the effect of a potion that has no time parameter (e.g.\n\nInstant Health) with glowstone involves no trade-off.\n\nUpgrading the time of a potion that has no level II effect (e.g.\n\nFire Resistance) with redstone involves no trade-off.\n\nCorrupting effect: A fermented spider eye changes a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion.\n\nA corrupted potion usually does the opposite of the original potion.\n\nCorrupting an enhanced or extended potion into an effect that supports the modifier results in a potion with the same modifier applied.\n\nCorrupting an enhanced potion of Poison / Healing results in a basic potion of Harming.\n\n[Java Edition only ] Enhanced potions of Leaping or Swiftness cannot be corrupted.\n\nA potion of Invisibility is considered a \"corrupted\" version of a potion of Night Vision.\n\nSplash potion brewed using gunpowder.\n\nSplash and lingering potions: Any potion can be turned into a splash potion, and subsequently, a lingering potion.\n\nSplash and lingering potions can be used best for affecting other entities.\n\nSplash potions and lingering potions can be modified in the same manner as their normal counterparts.\n\nFor instance, a splash water bottle can be brewed with any of the base ingredients; the result remains a splash potion.\n\nSome extended/enhanced splash and lingering potions cannot be brewed from their extended/enhanced potion/splash potion counterparts, respectively (e.g.\n\nRegeneration + \u2192 Splash Potion of Regeneration +).\n\n[Bedrock Edition only ] Splash potions are made by brewing gunpowder into a potion and lingering potions are made with dragons breath.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, splash potions' effects have only three-fourths of the duration of the drinkable form.\n\nFor example, a drinkable potion effect of 8:00 is reduced to 6:00 as a splash potion.\n\nIn Java Edition, splash and drinkable forms have the same duration.\n\nLingering potions have only one-fourth of the duration of the drinkable form.\n\nFor instance, a drinkable potion effect of 8:00 is reduced to 2:00 as a lingering potion.\n\nEffect ingredients imbue an awkward potion with a particular effect but do not alter potion duration or intensity.\n\nWhen added directly to a water bottle, most of these ingredients produce a mundane potion.\n\nThe exceptions to this are golden carrot, pufferfish, turtle shell, and phantom membrane, which cannot be added directly to a water bottle.\n\nBase potions are potions without effects, brewed by adding a single base ingredient to a water bottle.\n\nOf these, only the awkward potion can be imbued with an effect ingredient to produce a potion effect.\n\nEffect potions are primarily created by adding an effect ingredient to an awkward potion, which is created by adding nether wart to a water bottle.\n\nCertain effects require a potion to be corrupted by a fermented spider eye.\n\nThe potion of Weakness can additionally be created by simply adding a fermented spider eye to a water bottle \u2014 and it is the only potion that can be brewed without nether wart.\n\nUndead mobs react differently to effects than other mobs.\n\nThey take damage from potions of Healing, gain health from potions of Harming, and are unaffected by potions of Poison and Regeneration.\n\nThis section describes an education-related feature.\n\nThis feature is available only in Minecraft Education or when enabling the \"Education\" option in Bedrock Edition.\n\nCures are brewed from awkward potions using different elements.\n\n[Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education only ] Drinking these removes the specified bad effect.\n\nThey cannot be modified into splash, lingering, extended, or enhanced versions.\n\nThe potion of Luck and Unbrewable Potion [Java and Legacy Console editions only ] and the potion of Decay [Bedrock Edition only ] cannot be brewed, and can be obtained only through commands or the Creative inventory.\n\nAlthough Jeb said that in Java Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3 there would be 161 possible different potion combinations with 2,653 in the future, in the actual third pre-release only 22 different potions could be made without the use of external programs.\n\nOf those, 19 potions had one of 8 different effects.\n\nBy modifying the item NBT using an editor or commands, it is possible to get a potion that cannot be upgraded into a splash potion.\n\nUnlike crafting, smelting and stonecutting, there is no in-game recipe book for brewing.\n\nDestroying a brewing stand while still having a full 8 amounts of blaze powder drops the powder with it.\n\nTexture file for the 1.9 brewing user interface Crafting Enchanting Medicine [Minecraft Education only ] Smelting \u2191 \"The Mundane Potion is a remnant of an abandoned procedural brewing system\u2014meaning that the recipes were meant to be different each time you generated a Minecraft world.\n\nBut this didn't turn out to be much fun for the player and the system was abandoned, leaving the Mundane Potion without a purpose.\n\n\"It's sort of like an appendix,\" says Jens\" \u2013 Tom Stone, February 21, 2017 \u2191 jebtweet:119710836469149697 Minecraft Forum: All About Potions And Brewing - 1.9 Reference Guide Minecraft Potions - A Visual Guide Minecraft Commands - A Searchable Minecraft Database Gameplay View at: Template:Gameplay/content [edit ]",

information.\n\nReason: The texture for Bedrock Edition is different, please add it.\n\nSome potions texture/color was changed as of 1.19.4 pre-release 3, please add them.\n\nPotion View all potions Rarity Common Renewable Uncraftable, Luck [JE only ], Decay [BE only ]: No All others: Yes Stackable BE: No JE: No [until JE Combat Tests ] Yes (16) [upcoming: JE Combat Tests ] Potions are bottled substances designed to inflict effects.\n\nThey are created by brewing and when drunk give the player an effect for a limited time.\n\nAll potions are brewed from a water bottle, which is considered a type of potion but has no effects.\n\nWitches can drop potions of Healing, Fire Resistance, Swiftness, or Water Breathing if they die while drinking that potion.\n\nWandering traders have a chance to drop a Potion of Invisibility if they die while drinking the potion.\n\nWater bottles can be fished up as junk items.\n\nMain article: Brewing Almost all potions are obtained by brewing.\n\nThe Potion of Luck [JE only ] and the Potion of Decay [BE only ] cannot be brewed.\n\nA command to give a Luck Potion is / give @s minecraft:potion{Potion:luck}, while a Potion of Decay can be obtained via / give @s potion 1 36.\n\nBoth are also available in the creative inventory.\n\nTwo Health II potions can be found in the brewing stand on ships in end cities, and one splash potion of Weakness can be found in a brewing stand in igloo basements.\n\nin Bedrock Edition, the cauldron in a swamp hut contains a random potion.\n\nPiglins may barter a potion or a splash potion of Fire Resistance when given a gold ingot.\n\nPotions are used by pressing and holding use with the potion bottle in hand, as with all consumable items.\n\nWhen drunk they bestow the corresponding status effect to the player.\n\nDrinking a potion while already under the effects of the same potion does not add onto the effect's duration, but simply resets it.\n\nA potion effect does not \"downgrade\" if a lower level is activated.\n\nFor example, if a player has Regeneration II, drinking a regular potion of Regeneration does not have any effect.\n\nUsing a potion on a cauldron does not transfer the potion to the cauldron, but begins to play the drinking animation.\n\n[JE only ] Main article: Brewing Potions can be modified in five ways.\n\nBrewing glowstone dust into certain potions will enhance their level of effect.\n\nAdding redstone will extend the duration of the effect.\n\nBrewing gunpowder into a potion makes it into a splash potion (area effect).\n\nAdding dragon's breath to a splash potion creates a lingering potion (area effect that lingers on the ground).\n\nBrewing a fermented spider eye into specific potions modifies their effect, usually inverting it, which is referred to as \"corruption\".\n\nThe modifications of Enhancement and Extension are mutually exclusive.\n\nEnhancing most potions trades some of its duration for a bigger effect.\n\nFor example, the base Regeneration works for 44 seconds whereas Regeneration II lasts for only 22 seconds but heals more per tick during that time.\n\nExtending a potion generally makes it last 8 \u2044 3 as long as its base potion, so a duration of 3 minutes becomes 8 minutes.\n\nThe usual result of corruption is to invert the potion's effect (for example Swiftness becomes Slowness).\n\nInterestingly, corrupting Poison (continuous damage effect) creates a Potion of Harming, an instant damage effect, instead of the continuous healing effect (regeneration) one would normally expect.\n\nCorrupting a Potion of Night Vision turns it into a Potion of Invisibility rather than an inverse effect that might be something like blindness.\n\nCorrupting an extended or enhanced potion results in a corrupted potion with the same modifier, if it is supported by the corrupted effect.\n\nAll of the \"corrupted\" potions except Harming can be extended, but it is the only one that can be enhanced.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the corruption of Healing II or Poison II potions results in a potion of Harming I.\n\nBase potions are potions that have no effect when the player drinks them, but are necessary as the basis for other potions.\n\nIn Java Edition, the Uncraftable Potion is a potion with no effect that is unobtainable in regular gameplay.\n\nIt is also available in splash potion and lingering potion forms, as well as for tipped arrows.\n\nIt can be obtained using the following command: / give @s minecraft:potion{Potion:\"minecraft:empty\"}.\n\nIt is also obtained any time a potion has invalid or missing potion effect tags, and thus serves as a placeholder.\n\nThis section of the article is empty.\n\nYou can help by adding to it.\n\nThe effects given by Potions of Healing and Harming are opposite on undead mobs, which includes skeletons and zombies.\n\nPotions of Healing cause harm, and Harming heals them.\n\nIn addition, undead mobs are not affected by Poison or Regeneration.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, hitting an undead mob with a Regeneration Potion will always register as Regeneration I, no matter the level of the used potion.\n\nUsing a water bottle, splash water bottle, or lingering water bottle on dirt, coarse dirt, or rooted dirt will convert it into mud, returning a glass bottle with it.\n\nThis process can be automated with a dispenser.\n\nIn Bedrock and Legacy Console editions potion bottles may be used on a cauldron to fill it.\n\nUsing a glass bottle on a cauldron filled with a potion drains it and fills the bottle.\n\nPotions cannot be combined in a cauldron, nor can they be mixed with water, but as an added bonus if you use a stack of arrows in a full cauldron you get a stack of tipped arrows.\n\nfor 1 layer you get 16, 2 layers 32.\n\nIn Java Edition, potions can also be obtained with any status effect using / give and the tag custom_potion_effects, which is an array of effects for the potion.\n\nSee Item format#Potion Effects for more information, and status effect for a list of effects and IDs.\n\nJava Edition: \u2191 0.35 for the first sound, 0.325 for the second sound Bedrock Edition: \u2191 0.7 for the first sound, 0.65 for the second sound \u2191 a b c d MCPE-174867 Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: In Bedrock Edition, potions use the following item data values to indicate the kind of potion: tag: The item's tag

The amplifier of the effect, with level I having value 0.\n\nNegative levels are discussed here.\n\nOptional, and defaults to level I.\n\nduration: The duration of the effect in ticks.\n\nValues 0 or lower are treated as 1.\n\nOptional, and defaults to 1 tick.\n\nambient: 1 or 0 (true/false) - whether or not this is an effect provided by a beacon and therefore should be less intrusive on the screen.\n\nOptional, and defaults to false.\n\nshow_particles: 1 or 0 (true/false) - whether or not this effect produces particles.\n\nOptional, and defaults to true.\n\nshow_icon: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if effect icon is shown.\n\nfalse if no icon is shown.\n\nPotion: The name of the default potion effect.\n\nThis name differs from the status effect name.\n\nFor example, the value for an \"Instant Health II\" potion is \"minecraft:strong_healing\".\n\nA potion or tipped arrow getting its effects from this tag is named with the proper effect.\n\nThe default value is \"minecraft:empty\", which gives it the \"Uncraftable\" name.\n\nCustomPotionColor: The item uses this custom color, and area-of-effect clouds, arrows, and splash and lingering potions use it for their particle effects.\n\nThis color does not extend, however, to the particles given off by entities who ultimately receive the effect.\n\nThe numeric color codes are equal to the hex code of the color converted to a decimal number, or can alternatively be calculated from the Red, Green and Blue components using this formula: Red << 16 + Green <<8 + Blue.\n\nFor positive values larger than 0x00FFFFFF, the top byte is ignored.\n\nAll negative values produce white.\n\nNormal potions use an NBT \"Potion\" tag to indicate the potion type.\n\nThe values of the tag (to be prefixed with minecraft:) are: See Bedrock Edition level format/Item format.\n\nThis section is missing information about Potion of Weakness;Uncraftable Potion texture in JE 1.11.\n\nPlease expand the section to include this information.\n\nFurther details may exist on the talk page.\n\nThick Potion with status effects of Mining Fatigue (duration 4:00) and Instant Health II (duration 4:00).\n\nAn invisible

Blindness, Haste, Health Boost, Hunger, Mining Fatigue, Nausea, Resistance, Saturation, and Levitation, as well as the Luck potion textures also present in Java Edition.\n\nThese unused textures were added along with the other potion textures in Pocket Edition v0.12.1 alpha, except for the potion of levitation, which was added in Pocket Edition 1.0.0.\n\nThe textures were changed along with the other potion textures during the texture update in Bedrock Edition 1.10.0.\n\nStrangely, the potion of levitation texture is a duplicate of the splash potion of levitation texture.\n\nPotion of

this decreases the radius by a 1 \u2044 2 block immediately, reducing the cloud's lifespan by 5 seconds.\n\nFor effects with duration, the duration applied by the cloud is 1 \u2044 4 that of the corresponding potion.\n\nFor effects without duration such as healing or harming, the potency of the effect is 1 \u2044 2 that of the corresponding potion.\n\nThe effect may be applied consecutively if the player or mob remains in the cloud.\n\nFor example, a player throwing the Lingering Potion of Healing II straight down consumes the cloud within a few seconds while being healed 5 times for a total of 20 \u00d7 10 health.\n\nAs far as healing is concerned, this makes the lingering potion much more powerful than the regular or splash potion, provided that the player is away from other mobs or players.\n\nLingering potions can also be thrown out of dispensers like splash potions.\n\nLike the splash water bottle, a lingering water bottle puts out fire and damages endermen and blazes by 1.\n\nIt creates no effect cloud.\n\nLingering water bottles can be used on dirt, coarse dirt, or rooted dirt to turn it into mud.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, using a lingering potion on a cauldron adds one level of that potion to the cauldron.\n\nAttempting to add a lingering potion to a cauldron with water, dyed water or a non-matching potion empties the cauldron and creates an explosion sound (but no actual explosion).\n\nIn Java Edition, the uncraftable potion is a splash potion with no effect that is unobtainable in regular gameplay.\n\nIt is also available in potion and splash potion forms, as well as for tipped arrows.\n\nIt can be obtained using the following command: / give @s minecraft:lingering_potion{Potion:\"minecraft:empty\"}.\n\nIt is also obtained any time a potion has invalid or missing potion effect tags, and thus serves as a placeholder.\n\nIn Java Edition, lingering potions can be obtained with any status effect using / give and the tag CustomPotionEffects, which is an array of effects for the potion.\n\nSee Item format#Potion Effects for more information, and status effect for a list of effects and IDs.\n\nJava Edition: Lingering potions use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nBedrock Edition: Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: tag: The item's tag tag.\n\ncustom_potion_effects: The custom potion effects (status effects) this potion or tipped arrow has.\n\nOne of these for each effect.\n\nid: The resource location of the effect.\n\namplifier: The amplifier of the effect, with level I having value 0.\n\nNegative levels are discussed here.\n\nOptional, and defaults to level I.\n\nduration: The duration of the effect in ticks.\n\nValues 0 or lower are treated as 1.\n\nOptional, and defaults to 1 tick.\n\nambient: 1 or 0 (true/false) - whether or not this is an effect provided by a beacon and therefore should be less intrusive on the screen.\n\nOptional, and defaults to false.\n\nshow_particles: 1 or 0 (true/false) - whether or not this effect produces particles.\n\nOptional, and defaults to true.\n\nshow_icon: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if effect icon is shown.\n\nfalse if no icon is shown.\n\nPotion: The name of the default potion effect.\n\nThis name differs from the status effect name.\n\nFor example, the value for an \"Instant Health II\" potion is \"minecraft:strong_healing\".\n\nA potion or tipped arrow getting its effects from this tag is named with the proper effect.\n\nThe default value is \"minecraft:empty\", which gives it the \"Uncraftable\" name.\n\nCustomPotionColor: The item uses this custom color, and area-of-effect clouds, arrows, and splash and lingering potions use it for their particle effects.\n\nThis color does not extend, however, to the particles given off by entities who ultimately receive the effect.\n\nThe numeric color codes are equal to the hex code of the color converted to a decimal number, or can alternatively be calculated from the Red, Green and Blue components using this formula: Red << 16 + Green <<8 + Blue.\n\nFor positive values larger than 0x00FFFFFF, the top byte is ignored.\n\nAll negative values produce white.\n\nThrown lingering potion Behavior Does not exist Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: See also: Chunk format and Potion data values Lingering potions when thrown have entity data that define various properties of the entity.\n\nEntity data Tags common to all entities Tags common to all projectiles Item: The item that was thrown.\n\nThe entity renders as a lingering potion if the id is lingering_potion, otherwise it renders as a splash potion.\n\nTags common to all potion items Area Effect Cloud Behavior Does not exist Java Edition: Bedrock Edition: See also: Chunk format The cloud that is created when: lingering potions are thrown;

contained liquid Transparent Yes Flammable No Catches fire from lava No A cauldron is a block that can contain water, lava, or powder snow, and in certain situations, collect it from the environment.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, it can also hold potions or dyed water.\n\nIt also serves as a leatherworker 's job site block.\n\nA cauldron can be obtained using any pickaxe.\n\nIf mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.\n\nRegardless of the tool, when a cauldron is destroyed, its contents are lost.\n\n\u2191 Times are for unenchanted tools as wielded by players with no status effects, measured in seconds.\n\nFor more information, see Breaking \u00a7 Speed.\n\nA naturally occurring cauldron inside of a witch hut.\n\nA single empty cauldron is generated in each swamp hut.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, the cauldrons generated there are 1 \u2044 3 to 2 \u2044 3 full of a random potion.\n\nA cauldron 2 \u2044 3 full of water is generated in each igloo basement.\n\nCauldron in woodland mansion jail.\n\nCauldrons can be found in a few rooms inside of woodland mansions.\n\nTwo filled cauldrons can be found inside savanna, taiga, snowy taiga, and snowy tundra village tannery houses.\n\nA single filled cauldron can be found in plains village and desert village tannery houses.\n\nIn Java Edition, three filled cauldrons can be found in plains village tannery houses.\n\nCauldrons can also spawn in trail ruins.\n\nA cauldron can be crafted from iron ingots.\n\nCauldrons can hold a variety of substances.\n\nFluids they cannot hold include milk, honey and any food items that exist in bowls; namely mushroom stew, beetroot soup, rabbit stew, and suspicious stew.\n\nIn Java Edition, cauldrons containing fluids are considered by the game to be separate blocks from each other and from empty cauldrons, which does not affect gameplay but does affect the commands needed to place them.\n\nA cauldron can be filled with water by using a water bucket on the cauldron.\n\nOnce completely filled, a cauldron can be used to fill a water bucket by using an empty bucket on the cauldron; this empties the cauldron.\n\nDespite containing water, using a fish bucket on a cauldron does not fill it with water, but places water against it, meaning it does nothing to the cauldron.\n\n[1] A cauldron can also be filled by dumping a water bucket on the block above the cauldron.\n\nOnce the water block is removed, the cauldron is filled to the full level with water.\n\n[Bedrock Edition only ] It can contain three levels of water.\n\nOne level of water can be added to a cauldron by using a water bottle on it.\n\nOne level of water can be removed from a cauldron, filling a water bottle, by using a glass bottle on it.\n\nA cauldron slowly fills with water when rained upon, if starting empty or with some water.\n\nThis happens randomly, at 5% of the rate in which snow accumulates on the ground during snowfall.\n\nWater can be stored in a cauldron even in the Nether.\n\nWater in a cauldron does not freeze in cold biomes.\n\nWater in a cauldron does not absorb explosion damage; make sounds and particles; absorb fall damage; [2] [3] allow Riptide tridents to activate; [4] [5] or damage endermen, striders, or blazes.\n\n[6] Cauldrons do not deal drowning damage to mobs inside of them [7] and fish act as if there is no water inside it.\n\n[8] The player cannot float or swim in it, as the water is about level with the player's waist.\n\nJumping in a cauldron does not produce any bubble or water particles.\n\nA cauldron placed below a down-facing pointed dripstone that has water placed a block above it slowly fills with water.\n\nThe same works with lava, allowing for infinite lava generation.\n\nAttempting to add lava or potion to water empties the cauldron.\n\n[Bedrock Edition only ] The water in a cauldron cannot be sucked up by a sponge, whether the sponge is touching the cauldron or not.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, leather armor is dyed through a cauldron, so a cauldron can hold dyed water.\n\nUsing a dye on a cauldron filled with water colors the water, consuming the dye.\n\nDifferent dyes may be added to produce mixed colors.\n\nUsing leather armor, leather horse armor, or wolf armor on the cauldron dyes that item the color of the water, reducing the water in the cauldron by one level for each item dyed.\n\nAttempting to add water, lava or potion to dyed water empties the cauldron.\n\nCauldron filled with lava Cauldrons can be used to hold lava.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, when a cauldron is already filled with water, it empties the cauldron and makes an extinguishing sound.\n\nA cauldron filled with lava emits a light level of 15, similar to lava, and burns any entity inside of it; in Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, this includes mobs that do not take damage from lava like zombified piglins.\n\nLava inside a cauldron does not interact with water outside of the cauldron.\n\nThe lava disappears upon putting water in the cauldron.\n\nA redstone comparator with a lava cauldron behind it outputs redstone signal strength of 3.\n\n[9] [10] A cauldron placed below a down-facing pointed dripstone that has lava placed a block above it slowly fills with lava.\n\nIf a cauldron is filled by lava, using glass bottles on the cauldron does nothing.\n\nPowder snow is currently the only solid material that can be stored in a cauldron.\n\nA cauldron slowly fills with powder snow during snowfall, if starting empty or with any layer of powder snow already inside.\n\nUp to three layers can be filled.\n\nWhen the cauldron is full, interacting using a bucket, creates a powder snow bucket and empties the cauldron.\n\nEntities standing in the cauldron do not take freeze damage, and entities wearing leather boots still fall through the powder snow.\n\nA redstone comparator with a powder snow cauldron behind it outputs a redstone signal strength proportional to the fill level, up to 3.\n\nContrary to a cauldron filled with water, a powder snow cauldron that is not full cannot be filled up with a powder snow bucket, as using the bucket on the cauldron instead places powder snow against it.\n\nThis feature is exclusive to Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a cauldron can hold normal potions, splash potions and lingering potions.\n\nUsing a potion on a cauldron empties the potion and increases the level of the potion in the cauldron by one level.\n\nA glass bottle can then be used on a cauldron with a potion in it, filling the bottle with that potion.\n\nThis reduces the potion in the cauldron by one level.\n\nUsing an arrow on a cauldron that contains a potion transforms the arrow into a tipped arrow with that potion effect, and reduce the potion in the cauldron by one level.\n\nTipping multiple arrows at once can be more efficient, and it may use more than one level at once.\n\n1 level of potion tips up to 16 arrows, 2 levels up to 32, and a full cauldron can tip a full stack of arrows, resulting in 21.33 tipped arrows per potion.\n\nAttempting to put water, lava or a different potion into a cauldron with a potion causes an explosion sound, and the cauldron is emptied.\n\nAn entity that stands in a cauldron filled to any level with any potion does not receive the effect of the potion.\n\nUsing an empty bucket on a cauldron filled with any potion does nothing, as the bucket remains empty and the potion in the cauldron does not empty.\n\nA cauldron with water can wash the dye off of leather armor and shulker boxes, and can remove the top-most pattern layer of a banner, by pressing use on the cauldron with the leather armor, shulker box, or banner in hand.\n\nEach wash reduces the water in the cauldron by one level.\n\nThe water does not become dyed while removing dye from objects.\n\nIf a village has a cauldron that has not been claimed by a villager, any villager that does not already have a profession or job site block may change their profession to leatherworker.\n\nA cauldron with water or powder snow extinguishes entities on fire that fall into it and the entity emits black particles.\n\nThis includes mobs, players, items (if they land in the cauldron before burning up), and flaming arrows [JE only ].\n\nFlaming arrows stuck into the side are also extinguished.\n\nEntities must reach the water or powder snow in it.\n\nEach entity extinguished causes the substance in the cauldron to decrease by one level.\n\nIf the cauldron is filled with powder snow, it then becomes a water cauldron.\n\nAn example of a cauldron used in a redstone circuit.\n\nSee also: Redstone circuit A cauldron can act as a power source for a redstone comparator.\n\nWith a cauldron behind it (either directly, or separated by an unpowered solid block), a comparator outputs a signal strength proportional to how full the cauldron is: 0 for empty, 1 for one-third full, 2 for two-thirds full, and 3 for completely full or filled with lava.\n\nHowever, if there is a block between the cauldron and the comparator, the comparator does not immediately update.\n\nJava Edition: \u2191 a b MC-177082 Bedrock Edition: \u2191 MCPE-169612 \u2014 Many blocks make very slightly different sounds to
