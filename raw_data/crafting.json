    "content": "The crafting table interface in Java Edition.\n\nCrafting is the process of constructing tools, items, and blocks in Minecraft.\n\nPlayers can craft by moving items from their inventory to a crafting grid, arranging them according to a recipe.\n\nA 2\u00d72 crafting grid can be accessed from the player's inventory and a 3\u00d73 grid can be accessed by using a crafting table.\n\nItems crafted in the 2\u00d72 grid can also be crafted in the crafting table.\n\n2\u00d72 crafting grid (inventory) 3\u00d73 crafting grid (crafting table) Players in Creative, Survival, Adventure, or Spectator will have access to the 2\u00d72 crafting grid from their inventory screen.\n\nSmall crafting recipes that are at most 2\u00d72 can be made there.\n\nThese include wooden planks, sticks, crafting tables, torches, and some shapeless recipes.\n\nTo craft items using a 3\u00d73 grid, create a crafting table with 4 wooden planks, place it in the world, and press use while facing it.\n\nThis brings up an interface with a 3\u00d73 crafting grid, which the player can use to craft any crafting recipe in the game.\n\nThere is also a recipe book where you can access all the crafting recipes.\n\nSome recipes do not require their ingredients to be arranged in a specific way on the crafting grid.\n\nThese are commonly known as shapeless recipes.\n\nFor example, players can craft a fermented spider eye by placing its ingredients anywhere within the grid.\n\nOn the other hand, many recipes must have their ingredients placed in the correct relative positions on the crafting grid.\n\nThese are commonly known as shaped recipes.\n\nIngredients in shaped recipes can be \u2018moved\u2019 up, down, left, or right.\n\nThey can also be flipped side-ways.\n\nFor example, a 3\u00d71 recipe, such as bread, can be made using the top, middle, or bottom row of the 3\u00d73 grid, and a bow may be made with the strings placed on the left instead of on the right.\n\nThere are recipes that may not be moved or mirrored in this way.\n\nThese are commonly known as fixed recipes.\n\nFor example, dyes in banner recipes must be specifically placed to achieve the desired pattern.\n\n[Bedrock Edition only ] Fixed recipes can be added by data packs or mods.\n\nUnlike other in-game actions such as smelting, brewing, and enchanting, crafting is completely silent.\n\nMain article: Recipe book The recipe book is a mechanic in Minecraft that serves as a catalog of recipes and as a crafting guide.\n\nIt shows every crafting recipe that the player has had materials for.\n\nCrafting recipes are organized in several different categories.\n\nThe categories differ between Java and Bedrock.\n\nOn Bedrock, categories consist of craftable items from each Creative inventory tab.\n\nOn Java, the categories are as follows: The first tab contains every unlocked recipe.\n\nThe second tab contains tools, weapons, and armor.\n\nThe third tab contains building materials.\n\nThe fourth tab contains food and miscellaneous items.\n\nThe fifth tab contains redstone materials.\n\nMain article: Recipe Recipes, including crafting recipes, can be configured by data packs in Java Edition or add-ons in Bedrock Edition.\n\nThere are currently 379 crafting recipes as of 1.16.\n\nTo save space, some recipes are animated (requires JavaScript).\n\nOn this wiki, shapeless recipes are marked with a pair of intertwined arrows on the crafting table graphic, while fixed crafting recipes are marked by an exclamation point.\n\nThese symbols do not appear in the game.\n\nMain article: Crafting/Building blocks [edit ] Main article: Crafting/Decoration blocks [edit ] Main article: Crafting/Redstone [edit ] Main article: Crafting/Transportation [edit ] Main
