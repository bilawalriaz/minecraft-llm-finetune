Observer-based farm:\n   - Build a row of farmland\n   - Place water source at one end behind a piston\n   - Plant crops\n   - Place observers watching the crops\n   - Connect observers to the piston with redstone\n   - When crops grow fully, observer detects the change and triggers water flow\n\n3. Villager-powered farm:\n   - Create a platform with farmland\n   - Place a farmer villager who can't leave the area\n   - Add a second platform below with hoppers leading to chests\n   - The villager will plant and harvest crops, but can't pick up all items\n   - Items fall through gaps to the collection system\n\nFor animal farms, you can use water streams to push them to a collection point, or use breeding mechanics with trapdoors for baby animals."}

Create a new portal\n   - If you have obsidian (10 blocks) and flint and steel, build a new portal\n   - This creates a new exit but might be far from your base\n\n4. Use a lodestone compass\n   - If you have a lodestone set up near your portal, a compass linked to it will point the way\n\n5. Last resort\n   - If you have valuable items, put them in a chest and note coordinates\n   - Use the death respawn as a way back (you'll lose XP though)\n\nFor future Nether exploration:\n- Always bring obsidian and flint and steel\n- Create cobblestone markers or place torches systematically\n- Build a safe path from your portal"}

Use the strip mining technique:\n   - Dig a main tunnel\n   - Branch out with 1-block wide tunnels\n   - Space branches 3 blocks apart for maximum efficiency\n\n3. Bring the right tools:\n   - Iron or diamond pickaxe (required for diamond ore)\n   - Water bucket (for lava encounters)\n   - Torches for lighting\n   - Food and weapons for safety\n\n4. Look for exposed diamonds in ravines and caves at the right depth\n\n5.

Without a map:\n   - They spawn only in Dark Forest biomes\n   - These mansions are extremely rare and can be thousands of blocks away\n   - Extensive exploration is required\n\n3. Using commands (if allowed):\n   - /locate mansion\n   - This will give you coordinates to the nearest mansion\n\n4. Be prepared before going:\n   - Bring good armor and weapons\n   - Pack plenty of food and torches\n   - The mansion contains hostile mobs and Vindicators/Evokers\n\nWoodland Mansions are worth finding for their unique loot and to battle Evokers, which drop Totems of Undying."}
